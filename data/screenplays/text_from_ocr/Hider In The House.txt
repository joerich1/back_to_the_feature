On a very lovely street in a very nice neighborhood Tom
Sykes THE HIDER is out for a walk The Hider is a man
who blends in well with his surroundings A good-looking
man in his thirties To look at him you wouldnt know

there was anything wrong

The Hider walks with such strange grace that he could be
on a conveyor belt a variety of neighborhood houses
passing him by one style after another

Sunlight and shadow play over the Hiders face as he walks
filtered through the lush trees and greenery all around

Then the hedge hes walking past ends and the next house
makes him stop Because it isnt a house yet Its a
half-house A house under reconstruction Part built
part torn down part finished part matchstick frame An
evolving house with a swarm of workmen all over it
hammering sawing drilling

The Hider stands and watches awhile

CUT TO

EXT THE HOUSE — EVENING

The workmen have gone The Hider enters the house from the
back where its all completely open without doors or
windows

INT THE HOUSE

The Hider explores in the waning light There are building
materials about He runs his hand over a pile of bricks
He looks at some wooden boards and planks leaning against

a wall WIND HOWLS through the dark house

He tries the tap on a newly installed sink Water gushes
out

Where the main stairway will be is now only a ladder The
Hider climbs it to the next floor There are a number of
rooms a hallway to more rooms On a worktable are some

plans and blueprints The Hider looks at them

Behind a door is a narrow little stairway The Hider goes
up it to --

THE ATTIC

A fairly large attic with a small window at one end The
attic is a part of the house that has remained pretty much

untouched

The Hider looks up

EXT THE ROOF

A trap door is opened The Hider climbs out from the
attic He surveys the scene from up here Below in the
backyard theres an empty swimming pool a partially
completed patio piles of dirt

Because the house itself has many curves and corners and

levels so does the roof The Hider jumps down to another
section and teeters for a moment where theres a gaping
hole (where the skylight will be) He catches himself

The hole goes right through the house all the way to the
ground floor

INT THE ATTIC

The Hider drops back in from the roof He goes to the
small window and looks out over the front street and
neighborhood The Hider feels tired He lies down on the
attic floor and curls up

MAIN TITLES BEGIN

CUT TO

MONTAGE - EXTINT MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE

In which we SEE the gradual progress of the house as it
grows toward completion -- juxtaposed with the activities
of the Hider as he follows his own secret agenda

We SEE builders carefully fit a big skylight into place
over that hole in the roof

We SEE how the Hider spends his days -- in a library
studying diagrams in a book on Home Improvements

We SEE him in the house at night up in the attic working
on the floor in some way hunched so we cant see Hes
draped a black cloth over the attic window and is
surrounded by candles

We SEE the house taking shape Carpenters finishing a
staircase

We SEE the Hider eating alone in a simple cafeteria

We SEE the back of the house at night The Hider appears
over the edge of the roof rappelling down on a rope
making little toeholds in the wall as he goes CHINK-CHINK
with a small hammer the SOUND MUFFLED by cloth The house
is quite private from the view of its neighbors and the
section of wall the Hider has chosen for his secret ladder
is further shadowed by being an indented corner

We SEE plumbers at work and painters arrive

We SEE the Hider cashing his disability insurance check at
a check-cashing place

We SEE the house further along Painters painting
Electricians wiring Landscape gardeners planting

We SEE the Hider returning to the house at night emerging

out of shadows He goes to his special corner looking
around —- and starts climbing His hands and shoes finding
the chinks in the wall only he knows are there In LONG

SHOT if we see the figure climbing fly-like up the side
of the house at all its only because we know hes there

We SEE locksmiths installing locks on doors Not that it
will do any good now

We SEE the Hider drop silently to the ground at night
Newly planted vines help hide his descent even more and
cause natural shadows to move on the side of the house in
the breeze of the night The Hider walks down into the
empty pool He stands in the middle of it Theres a full
moon The Hider spreads his arms as if to float backwards

SPLASH We SEE the Hider backstroking off one end of a
long swimming pool He rolls in the water and swims to the
other end where he climbs out The Hider is strong and
powerfully built He retrieves a towel from a bench The
towel says YMCA

We SEE the Hider at his YMCA locker after having a shower
Inside is everything he owns in the world The locker is
packed with stuff

We SEE the house nearing completion Two men with
clipboards walk around checking final details

They go up to the attic Everything looks fine They go
back down closing the attic stairway door

We SEE the Hider at a booth in a coffee shop sketching a
diagram in a notebook while he eats

We SEE the house is done And here the MAIN TITLES PAUSE
Because we are almost at the end of our set-up now Just
one more important job to be taken care of

EXT THE HOUSE — DAY

Its RAINING The house is all finished There are no
more trucks parked on the street No more rubble in the
driveway Nothing abnormal to set the house apart from any
others on the street The house is still and peaceful in
the rain and part of the neighborhood

EXT BACKYARD

The swimming pool has now been filled with water And
RAINDROPS pound into it

INT THE HOUSE

The rooms are stark and empty White walls Shiny wood
floors Light reflected off their smooth surfaces Coming
through the bare windowpanes

RECEPTION HALL

Here by the solid front door the house is an invitation
The hallway leading deeper in Doors to rooms The
stairway to the next landing The skylight over all RAIN

spattering up there on the thick glass

The only other NOISE indistinct is coming from the attic

H

HE ATTIC

The Hider has the house to himself now Hes finishing his
wall -- a false wall at the far end of the attic The real
wall goes straight for a while then juts off at an angle

to form a sort of alcove The Hider has bricked off this
alcove giving the illusion of one straight wall running
the length of the attic

THE ATTIC —- LATER

The rain has stopped Now the Hider is plastering his
wall

THE ATTIC - LATE AFTERNOON

The Hider is taking a breather He stands looking out of

the small attic window as he eats a sandwich To the
right he sees a NASTY NEIGHBOR yell at some Kids whove
come to retrieve their ball from his property The Nasty

Neighbor kicks the ball away as hard as he can On the
left a car pulls into the driveway of the other
neighboring house A mother (the NICE NEIGHBOR) bringing
her kids home from school -- a Boy and a Girl Another boy
comes by on a bike pausing to talk to the first Boy At

a house across the street the Hider hears a DOOR SHUT and
sees a Cleaning Woman in a white uniform walk away along

a path

THE ATTIC - NIGHT

The Hider stands back to look over his handiwork The
false wall is now indistinguishable from the real wall
Such a good job that one wonders why the Hider built it
why hes cut off the extra space behind it apparently
without access

but wait Hes made a secret panel in the floor By
pushing down in a certain way then sliding away a section
of floorboard a hole is revealed cut large enough to fit
him like a coffin He lies in it covering himself up with
the sliding floorboard again which CLICKS neatly back into
place and -—-

BEHIND THE FALSE WALL

-—- as he rolls under the wall coming up out of a similar
trap on the other side He slides a floorboard cover into
place over it He pulls down a foam mattress that hes cut
to size and blankets from where theyve been hooked up

He props up two pillows in place and sits against the front
wall beyond which is the street He looks over his
shoulder pulling the lever of a second vent hes installed
in this wall for air and to enable him to look out over the
street Across the way a mailman delivers mail to houses
A woman walking her dog says hello to the mailman The
Hider looks forward again Hes made a shelf or two for

himself There are a few books some snacks a Thermos and
plastic bottles of water He has a few other things He
has a lantern and a flashlight

The space here is big enough for him to lie down with his
arms at his sides or to stand comfortably Like a monk

in his cell its a room of his own

Listen no one ever said
expressing yourself to the
opposite sex is easy but when the
time comes you have to do it and
you hope the outcome will be good
for both of you
You come out of solitary and you
rejoin the human race as
difficult as that sometimes can
be

HIDER

When I was a child I got used
to the closets The boxes The
cabinet under the kitchen sink
with that persistent drip I
used to the smell of the boxes
Wood Cardboard I got so I was
comfortable there in the dark
Even even that old refrigerator
in the yard That smelled like
rust and decay

(pause)
It was safe in the boxes It was
when they took me out -—-

You dont want to know what his parents did to him when
they took him out of the boxes

THERAPIST
In the institution when you
were violent did you want them

to put you in solitary
confinement

He watches the Hider

HIDER
I guess so I mean I know Im
responsible for my own actions
It was never because I was angry
with anyone I didnt mean to
hurt anyone ever

Youre responsible for your own

anyone In other words youve
done your best Im saying dont
carry the burden of other peoples
actions on your shoulders because

The Hider nods in agreement Theres a pause

THERAPIST

Are you still afraid of your
parents Of them finding you

The Hider shifts uncomfortably in his chair
HIDER
That was years and years ago
They must be very old now if

theyre still alive

He puts on a brave face

HIDER
(continuing)
No my parents dont worry me
anymore I mean thats why I was

ultimately released wasnt it
I mean even with the state
closing down the hospital and all
Because Im able to be on my own
at last

HIDER
Oh fine Shes gone away for a
little while and when she comes

really tell her how much I care

for her

THERAPIST
Thats terrific Dont be afraid
to be demonstrative Youre

sounding a lot more confident than
when we last spoke

HIDER
Iam Im really feeling pretty
good I have a much stronger

sense of how far Ive come

THERAPIST
As long as you keep remembering
why

HIDER
Well we talked about the whole
disapproval thing

THERAPIST

(nodding)
The whole disapproval thing If
you allow yourself to get into a
situation where someone elses
potential disapproval becomes the
focal point of your life -- then
youre back to a life of fear
arent you -- Youre a prisoner
to that again and that isnt much
of a life

HIDER
I understand that

THERAPIST
And please dont for Gods sake
misinterpret that as being the
voice of discouragement in any
way --

HIDER
No no no no

THERAPIST
On the contrary -- this is
tremendous I mean were all

frightened to death of disapproval
and were constantly hiding behind
these layers we manufacture for
ourselves —-— and Im not saying

we should you know declare
ourselves unhesitatingly to our
fellow human beings in the
interests of total openness and
honesty --

HIDER
That would be stupid

THERAPIST
That would be monumentally stupid
All Im saying is -—-

CUT TO

INT THE HOUSE — BY THE PATIO DOORS - NIGHT

A SCRATCHING at the glass Then a TAP And a CLINK And
a CLICK And the curtain stirs -- and a Burglar slips in
He crouches by the floor a moment listening and getting
accustomed to the dark

INT DINING ROOM —- NIGHT

The Burglar opens the drawers of some cabinets in here
Looking for loot Its after midnight and the lights are
out

INT LIVING ROOM —- NIGHT

The Burglar comes in He goes over to the TV and crouches
down to look at the VCR in the trolley underneath He runs
his hand over its smooth surface then suddenly leans
forward to unscrew cables at the back This abrupt
movement probably extends his life by a few minutes -—-
because when a hammer comes down on his head the blow is
only a glancing one

The Burglar groans and turns —- the Hider was thrown off-—
balance by his miss -- and the Burglar has enough time to
put an arm up for protection -- the second blow shattering
his elbow He cries out in pain but hes a strong man
himself Hes a match for the Hider He manages to grab
the Hiders ankle at the same time and pull him completely
off-balance -- the Hider throwing his arm out to stop
himself falling knocking to the floor the vase he bought
for Julie —- landing on the floor himself as it SMASHES
alongside him -- and with a great gasp the Burglar pushes
the big television off the trolley onto the Hider

The Hider has the wind knocked out of him as the big TV
lands heavily onto his chest nearly squashing him like a
bug The Burglar is already running away clutching his

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
broken elbow -- but the Hiders powerful arm shoots out to
catch his leg pulling the Burglar back while with an
almost superhuman effort the Hider heaves the TV off his
chest

The Burglar struggles with all his might The two men
wrestle on the living room floor The Burglar tries to
gouge out the Hiders eyes Craning his face out of the
reach of the Burglars flailing frenzied fingers the
Hider tries to get a firm grasp on him He grabs wildly
at the Burglars hair finally getting a good hold He
smashes the Burglars head onto the glass-—topped coffee
table BANG BANG BANG —- the glass cracks -—- BANG BANG
BANG the Burglars face into the glass until the

glass breaks completely

The Burglar wont give up Hes beyond pain Hes only
trying to survive His hand is at the Hiders throat
squeezing They throttle each ether The Burglar is on
his back his legs kicking at the Hider His shoe catches
the Hider a kick to the ear They both cough and gasp as

a release is forced both struggling for a better position
the Burglar trying to slide out from under again the Hider
keeping him down --— and now the Hider is able to seize the
Burglars arm again and jam the fingers in a door jamb and
pull the door back We dont hear the Burglar scream
because the Hiders other hand is in his mouth but the
Burglar bites down so hard on it the Hider is the one who
lets out a roar of animal agony and the Burglars good hand
punches at his face the Burglar somehow on his feet again
trying to make it to the dining room

The Hider catches hold of the Burglars shirt tearing it
but pulling the Burglar back to the floor -- and the
Hiders foot slips in some blood and he lands hard on his
back hitting his head the Burglars torn shirt in his
hand The Burglar is crawling on all fours to get away
but his knees slip in the blood too and the Hiders legs
grapple him like a pair of pythons pulling him back and
the two of them struggle on the slippery floor out of
breath near exhaustion

Theres a tall plant in the hall The Hider stuffs the
Burglars face in the pot suffocating him in the soggy
earth The Burglars body twists and turns and kicks as
hes smothered in the damp dirt the tall plant shaking
above the two of them casting horrible shadows around the
entrance hall in the moonlight cast from the skylight

The Hider can barely hold the Burglars head in place
every muscle tensing as the Burglars body shudders in

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
rebellion -- and then the tremendous surge as the Burglars
body breaks free -—- Tall plant tipping as the Burglar
pushes back against the Hider with unbelievable strength

-- tall plant falling -—- the Burglar knocking the Hider
back flat on the floor the Burglar on top but the Hider
still hugging him in a death grip then getting a
full-nelson hold on the Burglars shoulders and neck the
two of them struggling to a standing position again the
Hider again smacking the Burglars head again and again and
again into the front door this time the Burglar sinking
back to the floor still resisting still breathing his
good hand still madly feeling for a grip on the Hider but
this time the Hiders hold is too strong and when hes got
the Burglar on the floor again hes able to get a knee
into the small of the Burglars back and with the knee as
leverage and the full nelson on the Burglars neck the
Hider pulls back with every last ounce of strength
pulling pulling moaning with the sheer effort of it until
—- the Burglars neck BREAKS

The Hider rolls off gasping for breath He pulls himself
to a sitting position against the front door He sits

here in the entrance hall under the moonlit skylight with
the shadows and the dead Burglar and the blood and the
earth all over the floor and he breathes air into his lungs
as if hell never get enough

CUT TO

INT GARAGE OF THE HOUSE — NIGHT

The Hider enters carrying over his shoulder a giant-sized

front He adjusts the drivers seat to suit him
