What happens to a dream deferred
Does it dry up
like a raisin in the sun
Or fester like a sore-
And then run
Does it stink like rotten meat
Or crust and sugar over-
like a syrupy sweet

Maybe’ it just sags
like a heavy load

Or does it explode

face The mountain will be higher the
rewards greater

You are here for one reason and that is
to play the best basketball that you
can- and to win

(eyes boring into each player)
Getting there ain’t gonna be easy I don’t
wanna hear the words ‘can’t’ or ‘won’t’ or
‘Mommy’ When you play for me you play
basketball my way And my way is hard

BOBBY JOE

HASKINS
In a few days we open the season Some of
you may think that I’ve been too hard on
you these last three months And maybe I
overdid it sometimes But if I pushed you
it was to see if you could keep going If I
made you hate me it was to see you play
through that hate If I was the enemy it
was only to see you bond together as a
team Because the enemy-- is out there

The players listen silent

HASKINS

You spent three months learning to play
the enemy’s game on the enemy’s terms
You see out there they think a team like
you can’t win They think players like
Bobby Joe ain’t mentally tough enough
That Worsley or Flournoy will fold under
pressure Or Lattin’1l run outta control
‘cause he can’t think Or that Cager
doesn’t have the heart to win

(beat)
So nobody expects us to do a thing this
year Were just Texas Western to them
But I expect big things because I know--
if you just play as the team that I
know you can be-- you will beat the
enemy’s game Just remember to play--

(the players chime in smiling)
fundamental disciplined defensive
basketball Lets go out there and play
Texas Western basketball and for the first
time-- make those words mean something

Haskins looks at every one of the black players

HASKINS
It wasnt so you would just warm the
bench of a white team It wasn’t so you
could make the plays while others got the
credit It was because you wanted a
chance to show what you could do on a
basketball court no matter what your
color no matter what some cracker coach
or some white trash fan said It was so
you could stand on that center stripe
after spilling your blood and have the
world say-- there goes a man There goes
a basketball player

FLOURNOY
But Coach theyve taken our
dignity away What kind of man lets
his dignity get taken away

HASKINS

Dignity No one can take something away
from you that you don’t give them Your
dignity is inside you And no one can
take it away You can only give it up

(he looks each in the eye)
Its your choice You can walk away or
walk through the fire and grab it all But

LATTIN
You playin’ in my house now Riley

ON THE COURT a shaken Riley HITS one of his two free throws
and Flournoy grabs the REBOUND Hitting Hill in stride the
blazing Guard turns Dampier around and spotting Lattin near
the basket drills a bullet pass through several Wildcats to
Lattin Lattin turns and looks This is his moment He goes up
and SLAMS a MONSTER DUNK over a startled ducking Riley

LATTIN
Motha Fuckers-- get out my way

THE BLACK FANS are on their feet crazy CHEERING Togo leaps
off the bench whipping his towel like a mad man Shed passes
Riley grinning

SHED
Hey man you looked like the
brother’s shadow out there

Riley tries to ignore him

FIRST ANNOUNCER (VO)
The big center for Texas Western is
dominating the smaller Kentucky Wildcat line
up so far But the real test is whether the
upstart Miners can stop Dampier Once the All
American gets going nobody can stop him

In a quick succession of plays all directed by Dampier the
Wildcats score on a fast break to Jaracz Riley hits a jumper
from the corner and Dampier nails an 18 footer

MARY AND THE OTHER MINER FANS have their hearts in their
throats The scoreboard shows Kentucky ahead 8-5

Flournoy twists his knee and limps to the sideline glumly

FLOURNOY
I can’t go Coach

Haskins pats him on the back and looks at Cager

HASKINS
Get in there Scoops And tell Bobby
Joe to get on Dampier

The Miners immediately respond Orsten hits a 23 footer and
Bobby Joe drives for the SCORE Feeling the pressure Dampier
brings the ball up against Orsten Crossing the mid-court
stripe Dampier turns changing his dribble from his right to
left hand-- but before he can Bobby Joe SWEEPS IN OUT OF
NOWHERE and KNOCKS THE BALL AWAY Streaking down court he
goes in for a layup and SCORES
112

FIRST ANNOUNCER (V0O)
Hill makes an incredible steal for a
score from Dampier A frustrated Dampier
brings the ball back up for the Wildcats

SECOND ANNOUNCER (V0O)
What happened to Dampier’s famous
Fort Knox hands Harry

Dampier crosses down midcourt and turns to his left when in a
replay of the last play Bobby Joe PICKS HIM CLEAN again and
takes it to SCORE As the crowd reacts with shock

FIRST ANNOUNCER (V0)
Hill steals again Holy Christmas we have
a game tonight folks We have a game

Togo is on his feet SCREAMING CHEERING red in the face
hyperventilating himself into a frenzy when his eyes suddenly
roll back and he PASSES OUT on the floor Ross rushes over and
slaps him in the face bringing him back to consciousness

AN EXCITED HASKINS exhorts his troops Hill Lattin and
Orsten to go at Kentucky led by Riley and Dampier like
heavyweights each trying for the knockout punch

FIRST ANNOUNCER (VO CONT’D)
I have never seen anything like this
Its like Louis and Marciano out there

The Miners SCORE AGAIN Rupp looks at the board where the
Miners are up 52-49 with 842 left He calls a TIME-OUT and
explodes into a tirade at his players

RUPP

playin’ nigger ball do that to you

RILEY

rest the Miners take the floor for the final push

THE MINERS LIGHT UP THE SCOREBOARD IN SLOW MOTION we see

THE BLACK FANS are on their feet white fans sitting stunned
and grim unable to reply

IN SLOW MOTION Cager buries a spinning hook and SCORES
Worsley takes a fast break pass in for two

ALL KENTUCKY CAN DO NOW IS FOUL and they do sending Miner
after Miner to the line Finally Bobby Joe intercepts a
Kentucky pass and holds the ball looking up at the clock

HASKINS IS LOOKING AT THE CLOCK suspended
MARY IS IN THE CROWD her hands to her mouth not breathing

TEN SECONDS REMAIN The score is 71-63 Trying to wind down
the clock Hill is fouled by Riley who has played like a
warrior It is Riley’s fifth and final foul He walks off the
court He passes Bobby Joe and extends his hand

RILEY
Great game You deserved it

Moved Bobby Joe takes Riley’s hand White hand grasping black
Bobby Joe watches Riley walk to the bench and Coach Rupp

RILEY

And we just got beat

Rupp looks at his great forward in bitter silence

AT THE BENCH the white players are half off the bench half
on their knees ready to run into court with Haskins holding
them back

MEANWHILE BOBBY JOE SINKS ANOTHER FREE THROW and as Kentucky
inbounds the ball all the white Miners led by Armstrong
RISE as one and begin to COUNT with the CLOCK
