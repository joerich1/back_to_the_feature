THE TATTOO

of
THE GIRL
from

WATERS END
A TITLE CARD

The Warming Age began after the Great Thaw of the Cold War
Free markets heated up and the ice caps slowly melted
Little by little the globe became one seamless ocean

The survivors scavenged rafts buoys anything that could float
As hope of finding Water’s End slowly faded

Sweet water became scarce and the wars began anew

FADE IN
THE EARTH

The round blue planet as seen from space A familiar image but
something about it is different There are no continents No
land whatsoever Only water Nothing but water

WE BEGIN MOVING in on the blue globe Descending into it as if
on a spaceship Closer and closer Now the screen is filled
with blueness

DISSOLVE To

THE OCEAN

A sweeping panorama of waves kissed by the golden halo of

sunrise Sublime and balmy Not a vessel in sight WE BEGIN
to pan along the gently curving horizon Empty ocean in every
direction Now at the end of our 360° pan we finally REVEAL

“OASIS”

A floating community Several dozen vessels of all shapes and
sizes tied together -- bow to stern -- in a large ring They
are connected by planks and bridges

WE MOVE CLOSER There are boats of every description -- tugs
trawlers Chinese junks river barges Most are simply
“houseboats for the various families but others seem to be
rigged for communal needs like the “Barterboat with its
electricity-generating windmill the Schoolboat which doubles
as a chapel and the “Vegetable Barge” where rows of bizarre-
looking hybrid seaweed are growing in special hydroponic tanks

IN THE WATER - NEAR A SLOOP

An angelic though impish GIRL of twelve is scraping barnacles
from the hull collecting them in a basket This is ENOLA She
grabs a fat one and sucks out the meat

VOICE
Enola lunchtime

HELEN a striking if somewhat intense young woman in her late
twenties approaches the rail and looks down at Enola in the
water
HELEN
I made a kelp salad

(CONT

ENOLA
We always have kelp salad

HELEN
Its good for you

ENOLA
Im not hungry

HELEN
Have you been eating those barnacles
again Those are for later Come on
dolphin

Enola makes a face and climbs up the rope ladder with her basket
of barnacles Helen has set the table under a canopy with clam
shells and other scavenged china She dries off Enola witha
towel and begins to oil her body with whale blubber Enola is
squirming and fidgeting
HELEN
Stop that Do you want to turn red
like a lobster

Helen takes some flesh colored-powder from a small urm and mixes
it with the oi1 making a paste She begins to apply the paste

to Enolas left shoulder concealing a a small-round tattoo It
is crescent-shaped with a triangular nick in the concave arc -

ENOLA
Why do you have to do that every time
I like to see it

HELEN
So does every trader that ever drifted
past us I dont want you looking
different from any other kid Besides
it keeps it from fading

ENOLA
It doesnt mean anything anyway

HELEN
Someday youll remember

Just then Enola notices something bounce over the rail onto the
deck -- is that a flying fish No wait its walking over to
her Her jaw drops eyes go wide

ENOLA
Look
Helen glances over -- it’s a bird
HELEN

Oh my God It cant be

They move over towards the bird which COOS nervously and backs
away Helen reaches out smoothly and picks it up

(CONT )

HELEN
Do you remember ever seeing one

ENOLA
Ive seen them in my dreams

They smile at each other Just then a LOUD GONG resounds three
times across the water Helens expression becomes grim

THE LOOKOUT POST

High up in the tallest crow’s nest a LOOKOUT repeats the THREE
GONG warning gazing out to sea with his spyglass

LOOKOUT
(calling down)
APPROACHING FLEET EAST-SOUTH-EAST

ON HELEN

She grabs Enola’s hand

HELEN
Lets go

AERIAL ANGLE

A panoramic overview WE SEE MEN and WOMEN of Oasis
scrambling into a well-rehearsed routine Helen and Enola race
up-and-down across the planks that connect the boats towards a
central platform where many PEOPLE are gathering A MAN is
passing out weapons ANOTHER is rounding up the CHILDREN

THE PLATFORM

Helen approaches a tough-looking woman with short spiked hair
This is ANGEL her sister Helen holds up the bird

ANGEL
Jesus

Other PEOPLE move in for a look crowding around with stunned
expressions TROY a boy of sixteen looks on in wonder

TROY
Whats that

HELEN
Its called a bird

MAN
They swim through the air We must be
near Waters Endthats where those
things come from

RODNEY a nervous man with frightened eyes pushes his way to
the front

RODNEY
Great timing Were about to be
slaughtered

(CONT )

HELEN
Dont say that We have to win
thats all We cant let them find it
before us How many times have we
rehearsed for this Were gonna give
them the fight of their lives

VOICE
Yeah
HELEN
Thats right Were tough
(holds up the bird)
And now we have some extra incentive

Everybody CHEERS waving their guns and makeshift weapons

ANGEL
Lets kick some pirate butt

CUT TO
A FEW MILES AWAY

The approaching fleet shoots ahead full-throttle -- a mean
assembly of PIRATES on crafts of every description The charge is
lead by MEN on attack aqua-cycles their handle bars outfitted
with swivelling 25mm guns Behind them in tight formation is the
“INFANTRY” a rabid assortment of KILLERS on motorized surf-boards
attached to cigarette boats When the time comes theyll
unbuckle their harnesses and shoot off solo Then the “ARTILLERY”
four matching swamp skiffs with out-rigged airplane props Large
mortars are bolted to the foredecks WATER-SKIERS are being towed
behind each boat various deadly weapons dangling from their wet
suits Finally the “Command” Hovercraft brings up the rear

CUT BACK TO
OASIS

SIMON an ancient man of at least eighty is leading the
CHILDREN into the hold of a trawler

SIMON
No need to panic now

VOICE (0S)
Wait a minute

Its Angel She walks up to Troy who looks scared

ANGEL
You just turned sixteen didn’t you
kid
TROY
(hesitant)
Yes
ANGEL

You have to fight

(CONT

Troy looks anxiously at Simon

SIMON
Those are the ruies Troy
ANGEL
Don’t worry I’1l take care of him
(to TROY)

Follow me

ANOTHER PART OF THE RING

Helen races along hand-in-hand with Enola They come the
“Vegetable-Barge” where Helen pulls an oil-drum out of a recess
She lifts the lid and Enola climbs inside the barrel Helen
hands her the bird
HELEN
Take the bird too I dont want them
to find it

Helen grabs an oxygen cannister and checks the valve She puts
it in the barrel with Enola

HELEN
Its set so you have air for an hour
Dont touch the valve If you
overpressurize they might see the
bubbles

ENOLA
You said we were going to win So
why do I have to hide

A little tear begins to snake its way down knola’s cheek

HELEN
Go on dolphin Be brave

She reaches inside a pouch and pulls out two circular glass
pendants Clear crystal medallions protected in leather
sleeves Helen hands the smaller one to Enola

HELEN
Remember these Our lucky amlets
As long as we wear them well never
be separated right

ENOLA
(sadly)
Right

Enola puts it around her neck Helen does likewise They hug
Then Enola ducks inside the barrel Helen secures the rubber
gaskets and the lid She heaves the oil drum over the edge of
the barge A thin nylon rope pays out as it sinks

CUT TO
THE PIRATES

WE ARE BACK in the thick of the attacking vessels BLASTING
ahead at break-neck speed The ROAR of the engines is
deaferiing Whitewater splashes around us wildiy The PIRATES
are SCREAMING demonically as combat adrenaline surges through
their veins A mile ahead “Oasis” looks doomed

CUT TO
A SERIES OF CLOSE-SHOTS PRE BATTLE-MONTAGE

RODNEY is prepping one of the defensive cannons An old
relic Spanish galleon style He pours in some gunpowder and
loads the massive ball

OTHER MEN AND WOMEN load bullets into rusting revolvers
Survival knives are strapped to thighs Spear guns pumped up

ANGEL and TROY ‘have taken position on a barge They are placing
the Molitov cocktails on the deck at even intervals

ANGEL
You good with guns kid

TROY
Im scared
CUT TO
THE PIRATE AQUA-CYCLES

CAMERA is on the handle-bars of the lead bike looking back at
the blood-thirsty mob WE BOUNCE insanely as the cycle surges
over the waves and SMACKS down into the troughs

CARLOS the driver CACKLES like a madman Hes the first
pirate weve seen close-up and HE IS SCARY

Tribal style war-paint smeared across his face A pierced nose
with a large fish-bone His hair a shock of blue flying back
like satanic flames On his forehead a self-inflicted
triangular scar And his eyes They are beyond description A
quasi-primordial post-punk -

CUT TO
A ROUSEBOAT

Helen straps a flame thrower onto her shoulders She crouches
beside the outside rail and looks out towards the approaching
horde Almost within range

HELEN
Come on you hastards

AERIAL ANGLE
The pirate vessels surround “Oasis” and ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE

The “ARTILLERY” mortars bombard the flotilla with cover smoke
“SURFERS peel off from the cigarette boats and BLAST through
the smoke FIRING at everything in sight

CONT

RODNEY tries to aim his cannon but is blinded by the smoke-
screen Before he can react a SURFER bursts through with a
lasso Rodney hurries to intercept him

IN THE WATER

The skimmers kick into full gear sending the PARA-SAILERS high
into the air They spray down bullets picking off the
defenders like flies Next the DRIVERS cut their engines and
PARA-SAILERS glide down onto the defenseless ring-boats

ON THE BARGE

Troy cowers below the rail trembling uncontrollably Bullets
RICOCHET and splinter the wood like shrapnel Angel is hidden
behind some barrels A PARA-SAILER comes gliding down out of

the sky Angel jumps up and nails him with her machete She

tosses Troy a flint striker

ANGEL
Come on kid Get the fireworks
going
UNDERWATER IN THE BARREL

It is perfectly quiet and womb-like but Enola is clearly
apprehensive She clutches her glass pendant and shuts her
eyes petting the nervous bird

MEANWHILE ABOVE

MEN AND WOMEN exchange FIRE with the PIRATES They are heavily
outnumbered outgunned Many of the boats have already been
boarded

ON THE BARGE

TROY strikes the flint and lights one of the bombs He lobs it
out at a passing cigarette boat and ducks as

BOOOMI

A colossal fireball surges upwards Angel gives him the thumbs
up Troy looks at her in terror Thats what those things do

ON THE HOUSEBOAT

A WATER-SKIER is headed straight towards Helen She pulls the
trigger of the flame thrower

nothing

The WATER-SKIER takes aim Helen bangs her tanks Is she out
of gasoline

Suddenly a STREAM OF FLAME bursts out of the nozzle knocking
her backward The skier catches fire SCREAMING in agony as he
continues to be dragged along like a FLAMING COMET

as
(CONT )

-Helen starts to get back to her feet but doesnt notice
behind her

A LARGE PIRATE CLOSING IN Its Carlos Ina flash he
grabs her by the arm and whips a large scythe around her throat

Helen instinctively resists but he presses the blade against the
flesh drawing a trickle of blood

CARLOS
You wanna die

She stops moving He paws her breasts with a vicious smile
Helens eyes falter Suddenly she swoons fainting He
reaches for her

BUT SHES FAKING Helen spins around and SLAMS him with
her gasoline tanks He sprawls across the deck and Helen turns
to barbecue him but the trigger is stuck again

He leaps to his feet and charges with his razor sharp scythe
Helen ducks the first blow by inchesbut the returm swing
gorges her in the gut Her eyes go wide with shock as she
grabs her bleeding stomach with her hand Carlos prepares for
the final blow -- decapitation

SLOW MOTION NOW The scythe slicing the air Helen hesitating
Its all or nothing The lethal blade cCarloss eyes Helen
surges Intercepts it with the flame-thrower nozzle CLANG
As metal scrapes metal

She dives backwards over the rail Into the water Agony in
her face as salt-water finds the wound

Slow motion UNDERWATER SCREEEEAAAMMMMM
DISSOLVE TO

TWENTY MINUTES LATER

The battle is over A massacre All the SURVIVORS have been
rounded up on the “Vegetable” barge They are huddled together
shivering quietly separated into two groups -- WOMEN and YOUNG
BOYS on one side MEN INFANTS and OLD PEOPLE on the other
Several PIRATES guard them with automatic weapons

The bounty -- jugs and barrels of fresh water desalinization
units solar distillers nautical instruments weapons
gasoline dried food and so on -- is arranged in neat rows A
mean-looking ROGUE is inspecting it He is DIETER -- his left
hand has been replaced by prosthetic metallic pincers

Angel whispers to a WOMAN standing beside her

ANGEL
You seen my sister

She shakes his head Angel turns to look at the group of “MEN
prisoners She makes eye contact with Troy whos been
sequestered with them He looks petrified

(CONT )

The “Command Hovercraft eases up to the dock TWO THUGS jump
to secure the stern and bow lines The large vertical-hinged
door swings open with a THUD A FIGURE emerges

Huge Six-eight at least Hip length hair yellow Not
blonde balloon yellow He has a solid-gold triangle attached
to his forehead And his cape -- its a dense mesh of hird
feathers Meet LAZLO Lord of Pirates

A YOUNG MAN rushes up to meet him Hes HELMUT also unique in

appearance -- one of his eyes is blue the other green
HELMUT
They must have hidden her
LAZLO

(ominous smile)
Dont worry

MEANWHILE IN THE BARREL

Enola is PANTING out of breath The bird COOS nervously and
flaps its wings She looks at the the oxygen cannister

INSERT - THE GAUGE is nearing the red DANGER ZONE

BACK ON THE PLATFORM
Lazlo moves forward and addresses the prisoners

LAZLO
Take me to your leader

No one speaks Lazio surveys the faces before him

SIMON
We have no leader It’s a round table
democracy

LAZLO
Spoken like a leader

Lazlo yanks him away from the others The crowd reacts with
concern as Lazlo manhandles the old man

LAZLO
Your people are very loyal This is
good Above all a leader need
loyalty no Let me show you
(to HELMUT)
A torch

Helmut douses a torch with some gasoline and lights it witha
flint striker He marches up to Lazlo awaiting instructions

LAZLO
Your hand please

Helmut nods grimly Then without hesitation puts his hand in
the flame Hovering there unflinching He grits his teeth

(CONT )

Lazlo watches calmly Helmut’s hand is blistering he begins to
shake
LAZLO
Thank you

Helmut pulls back his hand and plunges it into the water Lazio
turns back to Simon
LAZLO
That is my son What does that tell
you about me

SIMON
(horrified)
You‘re a monster

LAZLO
Exactly Nowlets get to business
We heard that you have a little girl
here A little girl with a little
tattoo I want her Are you afraid
of death

SIMON
You wouldn’t kill an old man

In the background Rodney begins to tremble

RODNEY
He’s going to kill us all don’t you
see

Suddenly he breaks free from the others and dives off the
platform into the ocean Immediately several GUARDS pepper the
water with gunfire

Carlos moves towards a submerged steel cage floating alongside
one of the pirate boats He yanks open a hinged doorway and
instantly a black SHARK FIN makes a beeline for the escaping
man sucking out a “leash” of steel webbing The water foams up
with blood Carlos cranks a large winch to recoil the leash and
haul the thrashing shark “dog back into its cage

IN THE BARREL

The gauge is near “EMPTY” Enola begins to panic
hyperventilate She opens the valve all the way and BANGS the
metal drum with her fist

UNDERWATER

A small trickle of bubbles begin to ascend from the “escape”
valve of the barrel WE FOLLOW them up to

THE SURFACE

BODIES are floating like logs in slicks of blood and oil A
PIRATE is patroling in a kayak jabbing the bodies with a
harpoon to make sure they’re dead Will he notice the bubbles

ao
li
(CONT )

Suddenly a BODY moves right in front of us It’s Helen she’s
“playing dead” Directly before her nose a stream of bubbles
is frothing up to the surface She sneaks a glance around and
makes a sudden decision Holding her breath diving
UNDERWATER

Helen follows the nylon cord down to the barrel She BANGS a
signal om the lid Then works to remove the latches The
first one opens But the other two are stuck rusted

INSIDE THE BARREL

Enola gasps for breath Shes suffocating water begins
seeping in through the crack filling the up the drum

ON THE PLATFORM
BLAMMM Carlos has BLASTED away half of Simon’s head with a -

pistol Point blank
LAZLO
(to the PRISONERS)
Next volunteer please
UNDERWATER

The second latch finally SNAPS open Helen is running out of
breath She pulls at the final latch with all her might blue in
the face

ABOVE
The pirate in the kayak has spotted the bubbles
PIRATE
(pointing)

Over here

Several PIRATES converge on the adjacent platform

BELOW IN THE BARREL
Enola has passed out The water level is up to her chin

UNDERWATER

The latch is still frozen shut Suddenly Helen feels herself
being hoisted up Someone’s pulling the cord from above Helen
looks up in a panic She attacks the latch with renewed frenzy

ABOVE

Lazlo and others are gathered round as Dieter pulls up the
barrel line The barrel breaks the surface Dieter wrenches
off the cover with his mechanical hand Lazlo peers inside
Just the bird Lazio picks it up and crushes it in his fist in
disgust
LAZLO
Save me the feathers

i2
(CONT )

Just then there’s the sound of the Hovercraft ROARING to life
Lazlo spins to see his boat ripping away from its mooring
bursting through the flotilla towards the open sea it BLASTS
right through a bamboo-thatched boat ripping it in two

ANGEL
Thataway Helen

Immediately several pirates pile into their cigarette boats and
peel off in pursuit
LAZLO
(to HELMUT)
Let‘s move out

Helmut directs the guards to escort the women and children
prisoners towards a souped-up pirate trawler The men and other
rejects remain on the platform guarded by sentries Angel
suddenly breaks ranks and grabs Troy from the man group which -
seems to be staying behind

GUARD

Hey
ANGEL

Hes thirteen Hes a kid
TROY

(nervous whisper)
What are you doing

ANGEL
Just keep quiet

Meanwhile OTHER PIRATES begin to load the bounty -- water gas
and so om -- onto the slower boats
CUT TO

THE DISTANT HOVERCRAFT

BLASTING ahead full-throttle Its definitely fast enough but
will they have enough fuel Three cigarette boats lag in the
distance

CUT BACK TO
“OASIS

Everything stowed the last of the pirate boats peel off The
“rejected men watch unsure as the pirates retreat The
prisoner boat begins to pull away Women and children watch
their matesfathers receding -- will they ever see them again
Troy looks at Angel
TROY
Why did you do that We’re prisoners

ANGEL
Shhh

With all the pirate vessels at a safe distance from the platform
of rejected men Lazlo turns back with a bazooka

i3
CONTL)

The men dont even have time for prayers before
THE ENTIRE PLATFORM EXPLODES
Troy looks back in horror from the stern deck of the “prisoner

trawler All the men of Oasis killed in an instant It
could have been him Angel puts her arm around Troy’s shoulder
CUT TO

INSIDE THE HOVERCRAFT

WE ARE at the bridge but no one is at the helm It has been
lashed down amidships WE NOTICE Helens flame thrower aimed
sternward towards the fuel tanks The trigger is tied in the
firing position Malfunction or not sooner or later it will

EXPLODE The Hovercraft rips apart in a MASSIVE FIREBALL

Lazlo an Helmut approach the smouldering wreckage on a
cigarette boat
LAZLO
(rage)
My boat
HELMUT
So much for the girl from Waters End

FADE TO BLACK ©
FADE IN

BERMUDA SHORTS

Someones crotch in a pair of well worn khakis The large
survival knife sheathed over his left hip looks like it has
recently tasted blood He moves to unfasten his fly -- his
hands coarse and dehydrated A manicurists nightmare

A BEAKER

Fills up with his urine Pale yellow No overdose of vitamins
in this sample Last few drops He’s done reaching in to grab
the beaker

A PLASTIC FUNNEL

The top of some kind of contraption A large translucent
funnel connected to a rubber hose which weaves down through a
series of valves and filters

He pours the urine into the machine and WE FOLLOW its progress
downwards -- through a paper filter along a glass tube down a
rubber hose Suddenly WE COME to something organic in the
chain -- a large slimy steaming KIDNEY

The organ pulses with the flow of liquid Processing it
pumping it out into the mechanical remainder of the contraption
which concludes in a copper faucet Somehow a living organic
kidney has been incorporated into this bizarre chain But those
familiar with anatomy will notice that it is backwards -- the
urine is being forced into the wrong end of the kidney

(CONT )

Indeed he places the beaker under the faucet and opens the
spigot Out rushes clean pure H20 Hes reversed the
excretion process turned urine into water

As he puts the beaker to his mouth and swigs it back in one
gulp WE SEE his face for the first time -- rugged
weatherbeaten No sentimentality here This is MORGAN a
arifrer in his early 40s

Morgan puts down the beaker and raises a pair of binoculars to
his eyes

BINOCULAR POV

A faint column of smoke rising several miles away on the
horizon His destination

WIDE SHOT

WE SEE his vessel A river-barge modified to fly a sail Two
cannons on either side a rack of weapons strands of kelp
drying on shelves barrels of water The boats name is faded
barely legible -- the “Miranda” WE NOTICE something bizarre
pacing on the deck -- a magnificent white stallion

In the distance the burning wreckage appears closer but still
not distinct Morgan adjusts his rudder slightly trims his
sail Morgan moves to the center of the deck where a series of -
oil drums are strapped together

INSERT - THE BARRELS

They are labeled H20 Morgan opens the lid of one but instead
of water its packed full of dynamite Theres a jerry-rigged
trigger -- a wire filament attached to a flint striker Morgan
secures it to the lid and gingerly closes the barrel Its a
booby-trap

ON MORGAN

Satisfied he grabs a speargun and an oxygen cannister from a
locker He takes another look with the binoculars

POV

Burning wreckage of a flotilla The aftermath of battle He
PANS south checking the horizon Whoah What’s that A
small motor-sailer bearing down on his opportunity It’s
another drifter also looking to scavenge from the wreckage

MORGAN (0S)
Son of a bitch
SMASH CUT TO
A SPINNAKER
Surging out of its sail bag The rainbow colored nylon balloons
upwards with wind as Morgan hoists up the halyard He re-
checks his rival through the binoculars

(CONT )

MORGAN
Let’s see you beat that pal

Theres a distant RUMBLE Morgan cups his hands behind his ears
to hear better An ENGINE

MORGAN
God dam asshole

Be races inside the bridge

THE BRIDGE

Morgan rummages below the counter for a can of gasoline He
swishes it around a few times Its pretty low

MORGAN
Shit

He scrambles outside

THE STERNDECK

Morgan leads the horse to a rotating yoke He harnesses it in
SLAPS the horse’s rump It begins walking round and round
turning a gear which drives a jerry-rigged paddle wheel Morgan
grabs the yoke and pushes alongside his horse The sound of the
other guy’s ENGINE becomes tauntingly louder

Morgan looks at his rival They are converging from different
directions in a triangle But his engine is at least five horse
power and Morgan’s only got the one horse It’s hopeless

But now the ENGINE SPUTTERS COUGHS a few times and dies

Hes out of gas
MORGAN

(picking up his binoculars)

Serves you right Gas-guzzling

stinkpot

BINOCULAR POV -

A scrawny guy Looks hungry Morgan PANS north About two
hundred yards away the wreckage is looking more promising
Its at least two-dozen ghost boats some burning others
ransacked No survivors

WIDE ANGLE

Morgan grabs an acoustic megaphone from the stern locker He
moves to the port rail
MORGAN
(thru megaphone)
AHOY DRIFTER I CLAIM THIS FLOTSAM
IF YOU APPROACHILL KILL YOU I
REPEAT KEEP AWAY UNTIL I HAVE SATLED

DISSOLVE TO

AMID THE SMOKE LATER

WE ARE surrounded by floating debris The remains of a flotilla
in the typical “ring” formation The “Miranda” is drifting in
the oily “centerwater near a floating platform

Morgan drags out another contraption Some kind of slanted
rubber conveyer belt He sets it up on the stern angling it
into the water Attaches the horse to another harness and the
belt begins to move The oil and water travel up the tilted
belt separating as they do The heavier water slips back down
into the sea the more viscous oil sticks to the rubber and
moves up the belt until it falls over the lip into a container
that Morgan has set up Hes skimming oil

Morgan glances at the other drifter who waits patiently sails
lowered about fifty yards away He grabs his speargun and
leaps onto the nearby platform tying down his barge with a
loose line Leaving his horse to continue skimming

Morgan looks around at the ring of “ghost” vessels WIND
WHISTLES through large holes in the hulls gorged by stray
artillery shells A bridge door BANGS open and closed hanging
from one hinge In the distance a windmill power genny SQUEAKS
round and round -- WE RECOGNIZE this from “Oasis Morgan
focuses his gaze on a severely charred platform across the way
all but burnt to a crisp Thats where he wants to go

He begins to make his way from ship to ship Theyve been
stripped clean of every conceivable scrap Neer a cleat remains
Even the decking has been ripped up for scavenged lumber

THE BURNT PLATFORM

Morgan hoards it with a grim expression Amid the charcoal
timbersare roasted human remains Morgan picks up a skull
with cool detachment Still plenty of flesh -- this was recent
He drops the skull looks around for clues Something catches
his eye He kneels down picks it up -- a feather

A feather attached to a fragment of cloth Morgan stares at it
an intense expression Unblinking his eyes speak volumes

SMASH CUT TO
A BOY

About four-years old Somewhere else another time Hes found
a bird One of his eyes is green one is blue He holds up the
bird A big smile
BOY
Daddy look An an-im-al
BACK TO

MORGAN
Thinking staring at the feather

There is a THUD Morgan spins Its the other drifter boarding
the platform behind him -

(CONT

MORGAN
That little fucker

Morgan races to intercept him The drifter drops his rope
sheepishly Hes emaciated Looks like he hasnt eaten in
weeks
MORGAN
Listen stranger I gave you fair
warning I kill people who cross me
You got it

Morgan COCKS his gun for emphasis The drifter nods
diminutively Hes too weak to speak

MORGAN
You aint gonna find nothing to eat
here Unless youre a cannibal and
you like it well-done

DRIFTER
Anything

Morgan looks at him for a moment

MORGAN
This was recent You see them sail

The drifter can’t stand it any longer Hes salivating
DRIFTER
Please
MORGAN

Which direction
The drifter points weakly

MORGAN
East

DRIFTER
Oiltrail

Morgan looks where he pointed Sure enough theres a narrow
slick of oil receding into the distance One of the pirate
boats must have been leaking Morgan turms back to the drifter

MORGAN
OK pal Dig in

The drifter dives down grabs a bone and attacks it

MORGAN
Don’t eat too fast You’ll get sick

DISSOLVE TO
DUSK

Morgan is at the bow of the Miranda In the background WE
SEE the remains of Oasis receding in his wake

(CONT )

Hes got an old rag wrapped around a stick in one hand a compass
in the other He dips the rag in gasoline lights it with a
flint striker Tosses the burning torch ahead in the water
Suddenly the “oil-trail ignites and shoots an arrow of flame
along the floating bead towards the horizon Its like a comet

Morgan checks his compass -- East-South-East
DISSOLVE TO

LAZLO

Addressing an assembly Its night and as he speaks WE PULL
BACK REVEALING more and more details of the pirate encampment

LAZLO
Its an imperfect world gentlemen
There will always be strength and
weakness

Lazlo is seated on his throne platform Around him stand
Helmut Carlos and Dieter Above them is a massive water
tower the central node of the pirate flotilla

“LAZLO (Contd)
Why not be on the side of strength
We offer you an opportunity here a
last chance for redemption Youre at
an age where you can still choose your
own path

Huge hose spill down from the tower reservoir like gigantic
umbilical cords sucking up fresh water from pirate vessels that
have docked to unload the latest bounty

LAZLO (Contd)
Resistance takes so much effort And
whats the point No one will ever
defeat us You know that in your
hearts

Behind Lazio the sheer magnitude of the pirate flotilla is
becoming evident Hundreds of boats -- the best and fastest --
berthed in a haphazard town of several acres Gaslights burn
in many vessels and shadowy FIGURES stumble across the planks
from boat to boat bottles in hand The sound of LAUGHTER
MUSIC and GENERAL DEBAUCHERY

LAZLO (Contd)
Look around you my sons You could
be part of this And loyalty is so
effortless “Do what youre told
What could be simpler

WE HAVE PULLED BACK enough to reveal the people Lazlo is
addressing Several dozen YOUNG BOYS -- the ones from Oasis --
standing in a triangular formation But their appearance has
changed They have been branded with the pirate triangle in
their forehead Their faces are streaked with warpaint

ig
(CONT )

Troy is standing at the peak of the triangle facing Lazio
directly Lazlo looks right at him

LAZLO
I offer this to you -- the chance to
be one of us Part of our family
I have a dream for us gentlemen
That when we find Waters Endand we
will find it first that it becomes
a place of strength I see no room
for sickness there for disease the
crippled the enfeebled Just
strength perfect physical
specimens perfect discipline pure
strength Do you have it in you to be
part of this dream This is the final
question

Lazlo stands up
LAZLO
My sons will supervise your training

He leaves Dieter moves towards the boys

DIETER
Its pretty simple Bend or break
You either join us or die Carlos
teaches you how to fight If you
survive his little seminar youll be
half-way there

Helmut makes eye-contact with Troy who looks utterly petrified
He moves closer to him at the top of the triangle

HELMUT
(so only TROY can hear)
I was standing there once Its not
so bad
CUT TO

THE MIRANDA

Morgan is taking a noon-sighting with his sextant He marks his
position on a featureless map Grabs his compass and spyglass
and moves towards the mast He uncleats a line hooks one end
to the horses yoke Puts his foot in a loop on the other end
Morgan slaps the horse on the rumpit walks towards the stern
hoisting Morgan up the mast He checks his compass looks out
with the spyglass Nothing

CUT TO
SUNSET

Morgan collects the strands of kelp drying on the racks He
crumbles them up and puts them ina pail Carries it over to a
trough and pours some out

(CONT )

MORGAN
(calling to his horse)
Dinnertime

Morgan grabs a handful for himself and munches on it He
carries his pail to the kelp locker and opens it up He starts
to fill the bucket then notices something -- a long blonde hair

Morgan holds it up Almost indiscernible at first Immediately
he jumps to his feet and races towards the bridge

He grabs his speargun loads two bolts and pumps it up He
unbuckles the sheath of his survival knife

THE STERN

One by one he yanks open the lockers thrusting the speargun
inside Hes taking no chances as he works his way forward

THE BOW

The forward lockers seems to be in order He checks the shadowy
recesses between pieces of machinery There is a NOISE behind
him He spins instantaneously drawing his knife

Its the horse

Morgan hesitates He leads his horse inside the bridge then re--
emerges Night has almost fallen Morgan rummages in a chest
for an old lantern He shakes it to see if there is any
kerosene left and lights it with a flint-striker

MEANWHILE INSIDE

WE ARE below the floor boards looking upwards through the
cracks A mysterious POV The horse CLOMPS around directly
above us Now WE SEE Morgan entering the bridge As he moves
around the cabin swiftly checking all the corners WE CATCH
GLIMPSES of him through the cracks Then he disappears

WE HEAR a board CREAKING Where is he Suddenly the planks
rip open above us Morgan is glaring down at us his weapons
drawn

REVERSE ANGLE
It is little Enola cowering in a recess under the floorboards

MORGAN
(growling)
Get out of there you little

At that instant Helen comes flying out of nowhere She leaps
onto Morgans back looping a fish-line garotte around his neck
Morgan thrashes backward He lashes out with his knife but
Helen deftly avoids the blade pulling the fish line with all
her might

(CONT )

Morgan spins around trying to free himself with centrifugal
acceleration His face is turning red with the build-up of
pressure Helen BASHES against the sides of the the cabin as
they turn An avalanche of fishing rods spill off a rack
nautical instruments are flying everywhere

The horse begins to shake its head and rear slicing the air
with its hoofs It kicks Morgans arm sending his knife
flying It lands inches from Enolas nose as she climbs out of
her hiding place

Helen is still choking Morgan with both hands The speargun
FIRES slamming a bolt into the starboard wall Enola looks
around for a weapon Helen cant hold on any longer Still
weak from the pirate wound she releases Slumps to the ground

ENOLA (0S)
STOP
Shes got a revolver Enola points it at Morgan with both hands
ENOLA
Dont kill her we dont want to hurt
you
MORGAN

You could have fooled me

Its a stand-off Morgan has his speargun leveled at Helens
forehead Enola is pointing the revolver at Morgans chest
Helen clutches her side wincing with pain

MORGAN
cool as death)
Drop it before I blow her face off

Enola hesitates She looks to Helen for advice but she is too
preoccupied with her own discomfort

ENOLA
Drop yours first

Morgan presses the speargun barrel against Helens skin

MORGAN
Say goodbye

ENOLA
(panicking)
Wait Wait

She lowers her gun Lets it drop at her feet

ENOLA
Dont kill us please We were
attacked by pirates They killed

MORGAN
Keep looking

IN THE CABIN

Helen is on lying on the berth patching sails with scraps of
cloth She hears the SOUNDS of Morgan moving about outside
Helen strains to sit up straight and see whats going on outside
through a small window But her mobility is severely limited
Shes obviously in a lot more pain than she let on

Helen listens Is he crossing to the stern She notices a
small crack in the rear wall Puts her eye to it

POV THROUGH CRACK

Morgan is rumaging through a locker He moves out of view
Comes back He has a rope Reaches into a bin Pulls
something out God its a skull

ON HELEN

A look of horror Hes a cannibal Now he moves aside and
disappears Helen thinks for a moment Then begins to drag
herself towards the door

OUTSIDE ON THE STERN

Morgan looks at the skull for a moment Still has a little
flesh Pretty burnt though Hes not going to eat it is he
Our hero Jesus

Morgan grabs a steel wire loops it through the eye sockets and
ties a boline to a thick nylon cable He tosses the skull over
the sterm rail letting the line pay out Hes trawling for
sharks whew

MEANWHILE ON THE BOW
Helen calls up to Enola on the mast

HELEN
Come down quick Hes a killer

She uncleats the line and starts to lower her wincing with pain
from her wound
MORGAN (0S)
Hey Who said you could relieve her

Helen turns She grabs an oar brandishing it as a weapon

HELEN
Stay back

Morgan marches up menacingly Enola is dangling half-way up the
mast
MORGAN

Get your ass back up there And keep
your eyes glued to the goddamn scope

Helen swings the oar back and forth in warning

HELEN
Hold it right there

Morgan narrows his eyes Just then the entire boat jerks to
one side Morgan races back towards the stern

ENOLA
What is it

HELEN
I dont know Quick

Helen lowers her down The boat continues to shake

THE STERN

Morgan is fighting what must be a mammoth shark The line whips
from side to side back and forth Morgan cleats it to the
paddle-wheel He and the horse begin to reel it in Helen and
Enola come peeking around the corner watching him

He turns notices them Morgan tosses Helen the speargun

MORGAN
Youll only get one shot Make sure
its in the brain

He goes back to the paddle wheel hauling in the monster shark
now only thirty yards from the boat Thrashing wildly leaping
out of the waterits a nasty-looking hammerhead

ON HELEN

She looks at the gun Looks at Morgan facing away Vulnerable

The shark is almost within range five yards and closing
Helen raises the gun Is she aiming at Morgan
MORGAN
(turning)
Now

CONT)

Helen hesitates then swings the gun towards the shark and
nails him between the eyes It goes limp Morgan storms up to

diminutive FIGURE cowers at his feet

HELMUT
He was scavenging some burning flotsam
about a week ago Said he noticed a
little girl and a woman sneak on to
another guys boat

LAZLO
Did she have a tattoo drifter

The figure raises his head slightly -- its the emaciated
scavenger He looks a little better but not much

DRIFTER
I think so yes Your Lordship Uh
respectfully a little something for
my services A pour-boire

LAZLO
Give him a drink

The drifter kisses Lazlos feet Dieter yanks him to his feet
and marches him towards the edge of the platform Theres a
gigantic anchor so huge it must have come from an ocean liner
The drifter stares at it for a second then his expression
becomes anxious Before he can react Dieter has clamped his
wrists into iron manacles chained to the anchor

CARLOS
Big reward huh

He nudges the mammoth anchor in the water with a large lever
The drifter looks down in a panic as the chain pays out at
lightning speed beside his feet Then in a flash he is sucked
overboard SCREAMING

THE “MIRANDA” DAY
Enola calls down from the crows nest

ENOLA

something shiny Morgan checks his compass Just a few ticks

He lowers Enola down from the mast intense expression

MORGAN

Give me that back off

Enola retreats bumping into something She turns and jumps
with fright

A big white nose

Shes come face-to-face with the horse who shakes its head
good-naturedly Enola stares at it unsure of what to do She
reaches out tentatively to touch it

MORGAN
Hey Stay away from him

Enola looks him abruptly in the eye

ENOLA
You just pretend to be mean But I
know you really arent Its ‘cause
youre scared

Morgan glares at her

MORGAN
You dont know anything about me and
its gonna stay that way

Enola sticks out her tongue at him He ignores her goes back
to the scope

POV THROUGH SCOPE

INSIDE

Helen and Enola are busy stowing things in the lockers Morgan
comes in with the horse He clears one wall and straps the
horse against it with thick webbing He tosses Helen some rope

MORGAN
Tie yourself down I11 get her

The winds begin to WHISTLE around the cabin The barge rolls
with the growing swells Enola climbs onto her berth and begins
to strap herself down Morgan comes over to assist her

ENOLA
(coldly)
I can do it myself

THE OCEAN

The winds are picking up fast The tiny barge begins to look
dwarfed by the size of the waves It rises up twenty feet with
the swells and CRASHES down into the troughs spraying up
whitewater

IN THE CABIN

The small room begins to roll nauseatingly The wind HOWLS
through the cracks Morgan staggers over to a free wall and
ties himself against it

The horses tongue hangs down pathetically Its eyes are
bulging

Enola and Helen are tied to their berths and are moving in
tandem with the cabin which oscillates like a huge pendulum
OUTSIDE

Its a full gale now The sky is deep gray Wind hammers
incessantly into the tiny vessel Water sprays everywhere The
mast soars wildly through the air like a conductors baton

IN THE CABIN

A locker BURSTS OPEN sending an avalanche of cargo across the
room onto Helen She winces holding her forehead Everything
is rocking like a see-saw The NOISE is deafening

Helen closes her eyes An instant later she is leaning over
retching violently onto the floor She opens her eyes
resignedly

(CONT )

The horse WHINNIES in agony It begins to buck and flail
against its straps

CLOSE ON STRAPS -- The webbing is old One edge begins to give
ripping

Enola is directiy in line with the horse She takes her glass
pendant off and holds it in both hands tight against her chest
The horse is thrashing in the background Suddenly the straps
rip The horse comes crashing across the cabin directly
towards Enola she will be crushed

At the last instant the cabin shifts in the opposite direction
sending the horse sidestepping away from her

It SLAMS into another wall ripping open several lockers
Objects spill out and bounce around the cabin floor

Morgan unties himself to secure the horse Enola loosens her
straps wisely as the cabin shifts again The horse is coming
back LOOK OUT

Fnola dives off her berth a nanosecond before the horse SMASHES
against it crushing the planks like egg shells

Enola is on all fours Shes lost her pendant Objects are
flying back and forth through the air Helen SCREAMS above the
bedilam
HELEN
Get back to your berth

But Enola has spotted her pendant on the opposite side of the
cabin floor Shes crawling for it The horse stumbles by
epileptically stomping inches from Enolas hand

OUTSIDE

The mast is whipping back and forth with the relentless wind
It bows at at unimaginable angle and SNAPS suddenly SMASHING
into the cabin

INSIDE

The mast comes CRASHING through the cabin boards gorging a
window-sized hole in the starboard wall Morgan has managed to
get the horse and himself strapped down

But now Enolas pendant slides across the floor towards the hole
in the starboard side She starts to move for it

HELEN

An instant decision

MORGAN
Stay where you are Ill get her

WE ARE back in the present Morgan rips off his straps and
moves quickly to the opening where Enola was swept away

OUTSIDE THE HOLE

He peers out into the raging torrent The wind rips around the
boat pounding it with water No sign of Enola Morgan ties a
rope around his waist and secures the other end to a post He
dives blindly into the inky water

THE OCEAN

The water froths up like an gigantic washing machine Morgan is
carried helplessly with waves

taut to the limit He calls out again this time with her name

Morgan spots the broken mast floating to his left Its his
only shot It takes all his strength to swim up to it With
his last surge of energy Morgan swings the mast towards Enola
She grabs it holding on for life Morgan paddles against the
raging waves guiding them back to the boat One arm against
the titanic power of the ocean

ON THE BOAT

Helen is standing near the rail She tosses out a life-
preserver on a guide line It falls near Morgan but he relays
it to Enola Helen pulls her on board Enola coughs up
mouthfuls of water

But now a great wave lifts the mast high into the air It comes
SLAMMING down on Morgan He goes under Helen and Enola stare
helplessly into the oceanic tumult for signs of Morgan

ENOLA
Where is he

HELEN
We lost him

ENOLA
(crying)
He saved my life We have to help

Well all drown that way

Enola becomes HYSTERICAL

THE “MIRANDA

Helen and Enola are busy unraveling a trawling net Morgan
feeding the horse when

there is a CRASHING SOUND of waves

A mass of water rises up beside the barge revealing a small
antiquated submarine Morgan races inside the bridge and
emerges instantly with his speargun and a pistol He SHOUTS at
the women
MORGAN
Get out of sight Quick

Morgan takes cover behind a barrel

The submarine hatch SQUEAKS open TWO JAPANESE GUYS emerge One
is a fat sumo-wrestler type with a shaved head the other is an
old man with an endless white beard The fat guy has tattoos
all over his body -- Yakuza-style He is GIGGLING nervously
his finger twitching on the trigger of a cross-bow The old man
unfurls a small green flag and waves it Morgan eyes them
suspiciously his guns drawn

MORGAN

A completely bald BLACK WOMAN emerges from the hatch She is
WANDA tough but somehow endearing

MORGAN

Maybe What are you trading

ANOTHER JAPANESE with round gold spectacles emerges carrying a
bundle He holds it up

WANDA
Gill net Two hundred yards long No

boss Wanda is just the interpreter They came to a decision

WANDA

Translation Another debate Fatty points to the horse and
says something to Wanda

WANDA
The animal Would you trade it

MORGAN
No No way

Enola turns to Helen as the Japanese debate same more

ENOLA
Why would they want the an-im-al on
their submarine

HELEN
They want to eat it

Enola reacts in disgust Wanda turns back with their decision

WANDA
OK Youre on Ten Gs

Spectacles goes below and gets two jugs of water

MORGAN
Tell him to drink some

Spectacles puts the jug to his lips and takes a swig He smiles

MORGAN
The other one too

He tries the second Morgan waits for him to swallow but he
cant fake it anymore He spits the salt water back into the
ocean The Japanese grin sheepishly

MORGAN
Real cute

WANDA
Hey give us a break Its tough
getting hydro in a sub

ENOLA

Morgan grabs six spark plugs froma locker Helen looks

Then she plays her trump card
HELEN

The Japanese throw down a boarding plank Spectacles carries
the water across and snatches the plugs from Morgans hands

Helen glares at Morgan
MORGAN
Ive always been solo
The Japanese escort the women across the plank

MORGAN

She turns Morgan tosses her his survival knife in its sheath

MORGAN
Do what you gotta do

The Japanese move to intercept the knife but Helen pulls it out
of the air
On the fly she has yanked the gleaming blade out of its sheath

and flashed it up in warning The Japanese are impressed
Obviously Helen knows her way around a knife

She turns back to Morgan and scowls at him

He averts his eyes and moves towards his horse The Japanese
push the women below and pull back the plank

WANDA
See you on the waves drifter

They close the hatch and dive

Morgan turns back and watches the bubbles ripple to the surface
as the sub sinks and sinks

INSIDE THE SUB NIGHT

The galley is a cramped claustrophobic affair with steam
HISSING from leaky valves Water DRIPS down in several
locations causing swamps of moss and corrosion

Enola and Helen are sleeping in a pair of hammocks which CREAK
back and forth with the currents

A large dark form sneaks up on them Its Fatty holding a

Then he motices something shiny caught in the rope netting He
reaches for it

Enolas amulet

Morgan holds it up in the sun He stares at the glass lens in

As if on cue the horse trots up to him They stare at each

his hands into a pair of rubber gloves The Japanese eye him
cautiously -- whats he doing A couple of pirates wheel over a
glass fish tank There appear to be eels inside Carlos
reaches in and grabs one in each hand He swings them around by
their tails building speed

Suddenly he flings them forward They swish through the air
and coil like bolas around the necks of Spectacles and the old

down her nose passing millimeters from her lips

Its high coon and she could sure use a drink But any movement
of her jaw pulls the hinged door of another reservoir releasing
a stream of salt on to her face

Great mirrczs have been set up around her to focus additional
sunlight om her The heat is intense
Drip Grip drip

Morgan takes the amlet from his neck leans down and puts it

He SMACKS its rear and the horse begins to swim away Morgan

Loads two bolts and pumps it up An belt of extra ammo He
tosses all this gear into a small tight-weave net

One day deep in the deep blue a
little fish came across a sunken
chest It was beautiful and shiny so
he knew there was something precious
inside He tried to open it but the
latches were stuck No matter how
hard he pulled they just wouldnt
budge

OUTSIDE

Morgan is lying rolled up in a blanket against the starboard
rail He’s also listening to Helens story which drifts out

through the porthole window

HELEN (0S)
Then he noticed a killer whale
swimming by And the little fish
Said youre the strongest in the
sea will you help me open my chest
The whale said Sure But instead
of opening it he swallowed the chest
up whole “Now the chest belongs to
me he laughed

Morgan leans near the window takes a peak inside

HIS Pov

Helens eyes are sparkling in the light of the gas lantern
Theres something hypnotic about her whispering voice something

mesmerizing
HELEN

The little fish was very mad He
found a school of hammerhead sharks
and told them that the whale had a
valuable chest in his stomach The
greedy sharks lunged at the whale and
ripped a hole in his belly

INSIDE

Enolas eyes pop open in horror Helen smiles and slowly closes
Enolas eyelids with her fingers

(CONT )

HELEN
You promised Enola

In the background WE SEE Morgan staring in at mother and child
a look of longing in his eyes Helen continues her tone caim
and reassuring
HELEN

The chest fell out but by now all the

fish in the sea had heard about the

chest and there was a huge fight over

it In the struggle it opened up and

they all gathered round to look inside

But there was nothing except a small

dead goldfish Everyone turned to the

little fish Theres nothing in

there they shouted this chest is

worthless At that moment an old wise

dolphin swam up to the group He said

“There was sweet water in that chest

worthless to you but worth life to that

goldfish Now there is nothing

Helen looks at Enola Fast asleep floating away into her
dreams

DISSOLVE TO
HOURS LATER
The first light of dawn is breaking and Enola is at the helm
The others are asleep below The engine SPUTTERS a few times
and dies No more gas
It is completely still save the sound of LAPPING WATER against

the hull The vessel is on the cusp of a fog bank As it
drifts the cotton-like fog becomes thicker and thicker until

it is milky white

Now even the water becomes obscured by the thick creamy haze
Enola looks around in awe Everything beyond the boat has
disappeared into whiteness

Enola turns slowly round sweeping the non-panorama

-0on the starboard side the fog is as thick as anywhere but
something seems to be out there

-a presence

--Enola notices something moving on the bow A small white
bird -- it’s a doveti

She can scarcely believe her eyes She moves closer to the bird
who retreats modestly Morgan wakes up nearby He blinks his
eyes notices the bird mola sees him

ENOLA
Its waters End Were near

(CONT )

Morgan stares at it

MORGAN
Shit wake everybody up quick
Its the pirates

suddenly the bird FLAPS its wings and takes off

Enola follows the bird with her eyes until it disappears in the
whiteness
ENOLA
(excited)
No its Waters End I can feel it

She strains to see through the hazesurely there is something
out there A huge presence looming just behind the veil of
whiteness Its becoming more visible the boat seems to be
drifting towards it

- something solid and massive
Morgan stands up

suddenly it bursts into visibility
AN ENORMOUS WALL OF STEEL

the cigarette boat is right alongside it They could reach
out and touch it its so close

Enola stares up mouth agape at the vast perimeter of steel
soaring into the sky for hundreds of feet extending
horizontally in both directions as far as thé eye can see The
surface is coarse and weathered paint peeling pockets of rust
forming
ENOLA

LONG SHOT

Everyone is awake staring up at the surreal perimeter like
sinners at the gates of heaven Boat steel curtain and
whiteness is all that there is They paddle along the barrier
searching for its limits

-now it seems to be changing angle the wall is beginning to
Slope in an overhang At the water level it begins to recede
overhead it projects outwards Finally the wall ends ina
sloping diagonal

They paddle the cigarette boat across the edge of the wall
Its almost thick as it is tall On the other side it sweeps

LATER

The group is making its way up an endless diagonal ramp that is
suspended along the hull The cigarette boat seems like a toy
hundreds of feet below at the base of the ramp

Their sea legs are wobbly unaccustomed to such solid ground
For the first time its not rolling below them

Morgan leads with his speargun drawn The others follow with a
mixture of caution and bewilderment

THE DECK

The group emerges onto the vast plane of the deck It is just
above the fog layer so the huge plateau seems to be floating on
an endiess sea of whiteness

The area is larger than a dozen football fields strung out end
to end Towards the stern a massive bridge soars up several
stories The surface is dotted with plant and animal life
Several gnarly olive trees are growing somehow bursting through
the deck from pockets where enough earth has gathered to sustain
them A small bird colony has formed with pelicans dive
bombing the water for food to bring back to their young

THE SHIP LIBRARY

Everyone is gathered around Morgan for a demonstration Long
shafts of late-afternoon light streak through the porthole
windows Morgan is holding up a globethe kind with the
mountain ranges raised up in bas-relief

MORGAN
This is Waterworld Before the Great
Thaw Waters End was everywhere Then
the ocean rose and covered it all

Everyone stares at what it used to be like Morgan crosses to a
round white clock against the cabin wall He points to it

MORGAN
Pretend thats the moon

Now he holds the globe up in a shaft of light casting a shadow
on the wall He moves the shadow until it begins to “eclipse
the clock face
MORGAN
During an eclipse we move directly
between the sun and the moon casting
a shadow

Now only a crescent of sunlit clock remains Identical in
proportion to Enolas tattoo

MORGAN (Contd)
But were also spinning at the same
time

He begins to spin the globe on its axis and suddenly as if by
magic a triangular nick grows out of the shadow portion
cutting into the crescent

Its one of the bas-relief mountains He has spun the globe so
the tallest mountain is on the edge of the sphere -- the lem

of the earth -- casting a tiny triangular shadow against the
clock-face Its exactly like the tattoo
MORGAN

Thats the nick in the tattoo A
piece of Waters End so tall that it
still sticks out from the ocean

They look at him in stunned realization An enlightened glow
sweeps across their faces Enola is beaming

Wanda looks completely confused Shes the only one that
doesnt get it
MORGAN
Enola’s parents or whoever gave her
the tattoo sent her with a clue that
you could use from anywhere on the
Planet It doesnt matter where you
are You get the coordinates off the
moon with a sextant If the moon is
overhead then we would be here

horizon then it would be right behind
us

Morgan vaults down the bridge ladder Several pirate vessels
are closing in on the diagonal ramp that runs up the hull

Morgan races across the deck He yanks back the hoisting lever
but nothing happens The ramp is stuck Morgan looks down A
safety hook is preventing the pulley from working The pirate
boats are twenty yards and closing

Morgan zooms down the ramp The pirates begin to FIRE Sparks
fly in all directions as bullets ricochet off the steel hull
Morgan lunges for the hook and tries to work it free Its
rusty and stuck

Now a pirate dives onto the ramp from his whaler He tries to
tackle Morgan but suddenly the hook comes loose

Immediately the gigantic winches turn and begin to suck the
ramp upwards

The pirate looses his footing and Morgan kicks him in the jaw
He plunges into the ocean Morgan claws his way up the moving
ramp Another vessel sweeps alongside and blasts a column of

fire

The ramp erupts into flame Morgan scrambles through the fiery
tunnel and dives back onto the deck

AERIAL ANGLE

The tanker is completely surrounded by pirate vessels Some

Morgan is the rover rushing around from side to side as

Enola is the “spotter She has a large megaphone and YELLS

Cornelius behind her is wringing his hands nervously
tweeking the telescope on occasion

The hull here is square and flat so this is where the pirates

are concentrating their efforts Hooked ropes fly up in massive
volleys Several pirate vessels are erecting a battlement with
masts and ladders But Angel and Troy are holding it valiantiy

They lob down Molitov cocktails which explode midair showering
the pirates with shrapnel Then they race over to the
battlement carrying a large cauldron-shaped vat They lift it
up to the rail and pour its contents down

Its boiling engine oil The pirates writhe in agony under
the napalm waterfall collapsing in SCREAMS into the ocean
ANGEL

On the foredeck of an attack ship Helmut is being strapped into
an elaborate harness -- its a monstrous catapult

Several pirates struggle to lock the huge launching arm into
firing position Helmut climbs onto the catapult and buckles
the straps

A pirate yanks out the retaining pin and the arm rockets
forward launching Helmut up to deck level

Helmut slams into the rail with a THUD He hoists himself over
Helen moves to intercept him but he BLASTS a cover of automatic
fire Immediately he clips a series of block and tackle
pulleys along the rail

Below pirates grabs the ropes and hoist up more ATTACKERS

Morgan runs to sabotage the beachhead But Helmut SPRAYS the
deck with an entire clip Morgan somersaults behind a vent He
peeks around his cover and stares at Helmut -- pure pirate lost
beyond hope of salvation

Wanda calls out to Morgan holding up her gun

Helmut is busy choreographing the assault He signals a squad
to the far side another back around the port rail

slowly realizing what is happening He is completely
surrounded All at once the pirates make their move
Morgan spins BLAM He took out three with that shot Now

Morgan looks at the mouth of the large tubular vent Suddenly
he dives in it head first

Morgan continues to sink down the endless shaft Now it twists
and corkscrews like bob-sled course Suddenly it ends and he
is hurled out into

A HUGE CHAMBER

Morgan spills onto the metallic floor in a stunned heap He
looks around at the stupendous volume Its an enormous empty
oil tank Walls soar above like a great vaulted cathedral

he hears a BANGING sound and turns to see Helmut launched out
of the chute opening His gun skids across the floor with a
REVERBERANT ECHO

Morgan moves above him with his shotgun Helmut looks up at the
menacing double-barrel

MORGAN
Stand up

Helmut complies glancing to where his gun has landed ten feet
away He turns back to Morgan and the shotgun They look at
each other for a moment Eye to eye Morgan takes a breath
Then he turms the shotgun around and hands it to Helmut

MORGAN
If youre not my son shoot me

His voice ECHOES eerily in the vast chamber Helmut stares in
disbelief for a moment He takes the gun Morgan is calm
accepting Helmut raises the weapon Aims it Morgan has not
blinked Helmts finger tightens around the trigger

Now Morgan closes his eyes Impulsively Helmut swings the gun
out sideways into the void He pulls the trigger

CLICK
It was empty Morgan and Helmut pokerface each other

MORGAN
Sem” You think Id give a loaded gun to a
pirate

A beat Was that a joke Helmut looks at the man across from
him Morgans face is enigmatic Is that a grimace or the hint
of a smile

Then simultaneously as if by psychic command both men dive
for Helmuts gun

-its skids further away Helmut grapples Morgan kicks it

Now a great THUD comes down from above Pirates have opened
the large overhead door Morgan glances up -

Pirates begin ta rappelle down ropes like spiders They FIRE
their automatics The sound ECHOES in the vast cavern building
into an excruciating CACOPHONY of overlapping explosions

Morgan notices a small door Its his only hope He dives for
it wrenching open the lock wheel SLAMMING it behind

IN THE PASSAGEWAY

Morgan has entered some kind of air-lock Another door He
yanks it open and bolts it from the other side

Its a long dark corridor somewhere in the bowels of the ship
Morgan runs blindly He can hear behind him the SOUNDS of
pirates struggling with the lock They BLAST at it with their
guns

Wanda and Helen pull themselves up the final rungs

Waves of pirates are making their way towards the base of the
ladders below them on deck Wanda notices something behind
them

Theres a pair of huge water-cannons for extinguishing fires
One on each side of the bridge terrace They jump into the
swivelling control chairs open the valves

A rocket-like geyser of water spews out of the nozzle Helen
swings her hose around to the starboard ladder The flow pulses
out like a jackhammer wrenching the pirates off the ladders
They fall SCREAMING to the deck

few Nothing He turns a key Still nothing

but then an AGONIZED GROAN as the massive gears scrape
against their rusted bearings Suddenly the engine ROARS to

gargantuan machine Morgan slams the throttle into Full-

Dieter raises a cross-bow TWANG A barbed dart shoots
across the volume Its attached to a long wire paying out from
a spool

THUNK It hits Morgan in the shoulder blade He SCREAMS

Dieter yanks the line back Morgan is forced to release He
pendulums across the void suspended by the harpoon wire The
thick barbs are lodged deep in his flesh He is helpless like
a fish on a hook

Lazlo looks down at him dangling below the catwalk with an
expression of pathetic agony

LAZLO
Reel him in

Dieter and the other three pirates haul the wire in pulling
Morgan up towards the catwalk

The flesh around the barb is turning deep blue Morgan grabs
onto the wire with his hands to lessen the pressure on his
shoulder blade lLazlo LAUGHS sadistically

LAZLO
How do you feel now small fry

Morgan is losing the will to struggle like a fish pulled close
to the boat
LAZLO

I remember you now I killed your

wife all those years ago Too ugly to

save But your son what a faithful

little soldier hes become Hed give

his life for me

Blake begins to PUMP OUT rounds of GUNFIRE ‘Two pirates drop

while Dieter dives aside and FIRES back tLazlo manages to run
away down the catwalk Morgans wire is released He plunges
downward «

-directly into the machinery The huge spinning gear
assembly -- hell be ground to a pulp

-but the end of the wire snags on the rail He stopped inches
short His feet are dangling above the 3000 RPM gears

the wire is slipping

--meanwnile above Blake has Dieter pinned behind a reservoir
The last pirate tries to make a run for it But Blake BLASTS
him He goes flying over the rail directly towards Morgan

-Morgan braces himself They collide The wire yanks off the
rail They fall The pirate is chewed up into the gears
Morgan barely clears the machine spilling onto the floor

He stands The barb is still hopeless stuck in his back The
pain is almost unendurable He gathers up the wire and holds it
up against a spinning gear linkage Sparks fly as he begins to
cut through it

suddenly he notices Lazlo charging him with a harpoon He
turns and parries the blow with a length of wire stretched
between his hands Lazlo swings again Morgan retreats

CUT TO
ON DECK

Angel and Troy have snuck around the shadow of the bridge tower
to check out the situation The pirates are busy hoisting the
Catapult launcher on deck in order to mount the final assault on
the bridge Beyond the pirates the pontoon plane sits ready on
the runway
TROY
Even if we hold them well never get
to the plane

ANGEL
Wanna bet How would you feel about
the largest gasoline bomb in history

Angel ducks into the shadows Troy follows her curiously
Angel finds what she was looking for -- a deck-level fuel
bleeder valve She opens it and a slow stream of gasoline
begins to pour out on the deck

Angel grabs some signal flares cracks them open She begins to
pour out the gun powder in a line along the runway Its a fuse

A shadow is slowly moving across the face Cornelius looks up

completely flustered Outside on the terrace Wanda and Helen
are still repelling pirates with the water cannons

CORNELIUS

CORNELIUS

IN THE ENGINE ROOM

Blake FIRES a diversion burst Then he leap-frogs over the

rail and jumps down to the lcwer catwalk Dieter FIRES back at
Blakes former position oblivious to his maneuver Blake now
creeps along the lower catwalk trying to sneak under Dieter

Below Lazlo explodes in a furious series of thrusts and blows
Morgan retreats each in turn but then trips on the ever-present
wire and sprawls backwards Lazlo lunges with the harpoon
Morgan SNAPS his wire like a whip It coils around the spear
and Morgan yanks it out of Lazlos hand The harpoon skitters
across the floor Lazlo attacks with bare hands They roll
across the floor towards the stern terrace

Meanwhile Blake is directly beneath Dieter He can see him
above through the catwalk grate Blake takes aim

CLICKI

What a time to run out of ammo Dieter spins and spots him
below He cocks his gun and aims

DIETER
Loyalty we all stick together
remember What happened to you

BLAKE
Its a big lie dont you see Hes
only loyal to himself you think hes
gonna take you to Waters End Look

DIETER
Shut the fuck up I dont believe you

He FIRES hitting Blake in the shoulder Blake stumbles to the
rail Dieter takes aim again Its all over

BANG

But its Dieter that falls Troy is behind him with the smoking

Troy and Blake look at each orher -- an unspoken bond Two
generations of boys that Lazlo tried to indoctrinate Troy
takes his hand and hides the triangle in his forehead Blake
does likewise A gesture of solidarity They smile at each
other

Blake turns to look for Morgan But theyre gone

THE STERN TERRACE

Its a tiny deck for ship maintenance directly below the huge
letters “USS BRIDGESTON Lazlo has Morgan pinned in a
backbend over the rail Directly below the enormous rotor
spins incessantly

Lazio is forcing Morgans chin back with his hand Hes looped
his other hand through the rail pulling at Morgans barbed
hook Morgan is on the verge of fainting from the pain Sweat
washes down his face in gushes Hes weakening Lazlo grits
his teeth with determination

Suddenly Morgan hugs Lazlo with his legs and flips backwards
over the ledge They both somersault over

-falling
but Morgan has grabbed the terrace lip with one hand
Lazlo is still holding the barbed hook in Morgans back
-below them the lethal blades spin furiously

two men suspended one from the other like chain links

-blood is pouring out of Morgans shoulder which has swollen
up like a small pumpkin The barb is still firmly lodged

Morgans fingers begin to slip off the balcony Theyre wet
with perspiration

-his face is in agony

CONT )

-he can’t take it anymore looks up to the lunar eclipse for a
split second and

releases so Lazlo also releases

-bue from nowhere Blake clamps down on Morgans forearm
hauling him up

-while Lazlo continues plunging downwards His cape of
feathers filling up like a parachute

For an instant Lazlo looks like he is trying to fly

then he hits the water The moonlit foam becomes sanguine
as Lazlo is shredded mercilessly by the rotors The feathers
spin up and slowly settle on a liquid carpet of blood

- Blake helps his father onto the platform

BLAKE

Weve got to get this hook out of you
MORGAN

No time Lets go
BLAKE

No wait Trust me Its the only way

Morgan looks at his son He shuts his eyes in anticipation
Blake grips the barb and twists it out counter-clockwise
Morgan grimaces clenching his teeth His knees are weak
Blake holds up the barb and wire He tosses it overboard

CUT TO

A pair of pirates are launched up on the catapult while Wanda

INSIDE THE BRIDGE
Enola is looking through the telescope Her expression suddenly
becomes panicky

ENOLA
Its there Its there

POV THROUGH SCOPE

Sure enough a tiny bump is emerging from the curved shadow
About thirty degrees north of the Equator

ON CORNELIUS
He holds up the sextant He looks confused

ENOLA 0S)
Quick Its disappearing

CORNELIUS
(sheepish)
I cant do it I dont know how to
use a sextant

Enola grabs it from him puts it up to her eye measuring

At that instant the door is KICKED open A squad of pirates
burst inside with Helen and Wanda as prisoner

PIRATE
Everybody freeze

A pirate grabs Enola viciously by the hair The sextant goes
flying
But now Blake emerges from the hatch

BLAKE

Ill take the prisoners Lazlo wants
you below

They eye him suspiciously

BLAKE
On the double

The men start filing down the hatch He points to the women and
Cornelius
BLAKE
Outside Onto the terrace

Helen begins to resist but then notices Morgan signaling to her
from outside He lobs a Molitov cocktail into hatch after the
other pirates Everyone dives outside as

the bridge EXPLODES in a massive fireball

MORGAN
(to HELEN)
My sons alive and kicking

OUTSIDE

Everybody has converged on the mezzanine deck The group races
down the central catwalk descending onto the runway

Meanwhile the second wave of pirates are hoisting themselves up
onto the deck from boats below Waves of killers are converging
on them

The group runs and piles into the small pontoon plane but at
the last instant Cornelius balks

as

(CONT )
CORNELIUS
Im not going Im staying with the
ship
MORGAN

- Are you crazy Theyll kill you

GUNFIRE begins to pepper around them Pirates are swarming the
ship getting closer and closer

TROY
Whos going to swim the airship
They11 kill us all

CORNELIUS
Im willing take my chances

Suddenly Angel pulls out a flare gun and shoots down onto the
deck igniting her fuse It begins to burn a straight line
right down the runway towards the massive fuel reservoirs

ANGEL
I just made your chances zero Ina
couple heartbeats this whole fucking
ships gonna blow up Now get your
ass into the airship

CORNELIUS
Oh not Oh no you shouldnt have
done that They never taught me to
fly I dont know how it works

Everyone looks at each other in a stunned silence The flaming

fuse races onwards -- about forty seconds to go Morgan suddenly
grabs Cornelius and stuffs him into the pilots seat
MORGAN
Learn fast

IN THE COCKPIT

Cornelius looks around in utter panic He flips a few switches
Nothing Wanda looks like shes gonna be sick

THE FUSE
Racing along thirty seconds
THE DECK
Pirates are within forty yards of the plane
CORNELIUS
Sweating profusely Tries a few more switches
Helen shakes her head in disbelief
THE FUSE

THE COCKPIT

Suddenly HAND reaches in from outside and grabs Cornelius
Its a VICIOUS PIRATE trying to yank him out Cornelius
struggles flails his armshits something

-CHUG - GHUG CHUG the props begin to turn It was the
Starter His hands slap something else -- the throttle

The plane lurches forward The pirate loses his grip slips
back onto the pontoon

The airship begins to rattle along the runway

THE DECK
the plane catches up to the burning fuse Theyre running
neck and neck -- but will the plane clear the runway before the

fuse hits those gasoline tanks

CHUGCHUGCHUGThe pirate is dragged along with them
IN THE COCKPIT

Cornelius is shaking with fear

CORNELIUS
I think were too heavy well never
take off

LONGSHOT THE DECK

The fuse burns across the frame in the foreground The plane
runs parallel with it behind Its a dead heat But theres
only about fifty feet of runway left and the wheels havent
left the ground

theyre not going to make it
the plane pours over the lip of the deck falling
down towards the sea

the pirate dangling onto the pontoon skims the water Hes
forced to release Then the plane suddenly surges upwards

IN THE COCKPIT
Cornelius smiles triumphantly

CORNELIUS
See Too heavy I told you

ma KAabooommilt

The ships explodes in a massive fireball which mushrooms up and
out singeing the plane The airship surges upwards into the
heavens leaving the flaming ship below like a tiny patch of
glowing lava in a sea of blackness

Smiles and SIGHS of relief Morgan has his arm around his son

MORGAN
What about the coordinates Cornelius

CORNELIUS
Ask the girl

Everyone turms to Enola She hesitates

A moment of suspense Then Enola turns to Morgan smiling
proud ean

“CORNELIUS

It’s right behind us We should
reach it by sunrise

But in the excitement hes released the stick The plane goes
into a nauseating nosedive He pulls her back up sending
everyones stomach through the basement
DISSOLVE Tor
THE OCEAN DAY

The pontoon plane flies towards us erratically The engine
SPITS a few times Now the plane begins a wobbling descent

It hits with water with a SPLASHY GEYSER somewhere between a
nosedive crash and a picture-perfect touchdown

But why are they landing Its the middle of nowhere
Wait Are those birds

Look a school of dolphin is surrounding the plane like a
welcoming committee The group piles out LAUGHING CHEERING
Morgans shoulder is bandaged

They are wading in the water A sand shelf

WE TURN 180 degrees TO REVEAL the most beautiful inviting
island you can imagine

WATERS END

Not just one but a string of islands A tropical
archipelago

The troupe re-enters the shot frolicking in shallow water
They make their way onto the beach GIGGLING like children

Its hard to maintain balance on terra firma after a lifetime of
sea legs They fall into the sand and roll around Theres aa
small shack in the background

and now Morgan stands looking in disbelief A heard of wild
horses gallop past them on the beach

Angel and Wanda step inside Dark and dusty Some rotting
furniture Then they notice some bones a skull Ebony black

THE APEX OF WATERS END

Enola has made it to the peak of the mountain She can see the
others way below her on the beach

She notices something planted in the earth A bit of cloth on a
stake She unfurls it -- a Union Jack tattered and torn
Below it is a metal plaque Enola wipes off the dirt It
reads

Edmund Hillary
Sherpa Tenzing Norgay
May 29 1953

Enola studies it curiously She stands wipes her hands

WE PULL BACK HIGHER AND HIGHER into the air like a soaring bird
Enola standing triumphant on the mountaintop

ENOLA

Now Im really home

AS WE SPIRAL UPWARDS into the heavens the string of islands
stretch out below us like an earthly paradise
