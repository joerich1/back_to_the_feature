herself in the mirror-- BETH HARMON All of 20 In the same
dress she wore the night before but now soaking wet

BETH

is still drunk high whatever Her hair stringy and wet
She starts to pull the soggy dress over her head--

INTEXT PARIS HOTEL ROOM - MINUTES LATER 4

She comes back into the room and opens the curtains to reveal
a grey PARIS morning outside Having changed into a different
dress she steps into one shoe hunts for the other

She shakes A GREEN PILL from a vial spots a mini bar-sized
bottle of Vodka on the dresser with a bit still left inside
puts the little bottle to her lips when--

SOMEONE STIRS ON THE BED

She turns sees a shape under the covers She stares clearly
trying to do the math as to just who the fuck is in her bed

She pops the pill Drains the bottle Grabs her shoes
INT PARIS HOTEL - HALLWAY - SAME 5

FOLLOW HER DOWN THE HALL to a grand staircase She holds her
shoes in one hand runs the other over her dress smoothing
the wrinkles the best she can

of a LITTLE GIRL on the way up The little girl stares up at
Beth as they pass

Beth crosses the ornate lobby heads for another hallway--
INT PARIS HOTEL - ANOTHER HALLWAY - SAME 6

As Beth hurries along the quiet hallway pauses in front of
large pair of doors and pulls on her shoes She then pushes
through the doors into--

A GIANT BALLROOM 7

As a hundred heads turn towards her While the room is packed
with people it’s dead silent They’ve been waiting For her

And now we hear one sound THE WHIR OF CAMERAS A DOZEN
PHOTOGRAPHERS gathered at the entrance snap her picture

The crowd parts to reveal A TABLE at the very center of the
room A CHESSBOARD sits on top TV CAMERAS have been set up
The sizelook hinting that it’s sometime in the mid sixties

Seated at the table waiting for her is VASILY BORGOV forty
A frightening figure in a dark suit Borgov is all eyebrows

and frown Beth approaches quickly shakes his hand and sits
down across from him

BETH

He nods says nothing A few more photos and then SILENCE
Beth watches Borgov make his first move PUSH IN ON HER--

The little girl staring at Camera

ANOTHER VOICE
They’re sending someone

BEGIN PANNING AWAY FROM BETH

TO LOOK DOWN a ribbon of empty Kentucky Highway hung with
low fog as the PAN CONTINUES ACROSS THE HIGHWAY--

VOICE
Not a scratch on her

--to A TRAFFIC ACCIDENT Car versus Truck Head on The car
flattened is wedged deep under the front end of the bigger
vehicle The TRUCK DRIVER stands away from it smoking eyes
on A BODY that lies on the asphalt covered in a sheet Now--

CONTINUE PANNING TO LOOK UP THE HIGHWAY

TO FIND A COUPLE OF COPS standing there holding a LONG LINE
OF TRAFFIC the makes of the cars put us in the late fifties
SIRENS and FLASHING LIGHTS of rescue vehicles in the distance
driving up the shoulder

COP 1
It’s a miracle

The other cop looks back down as CAMERA COMPLETES ITS CIRCLE
and once again FINDS BETH in a cotton dress staring at the
body on the ground

The door opens and Beth follows the woman into the ragged and
tired space Dirty dishes are piled up around a small sink

a nearly empty glass of milk on the table sitting across from
a coffee cup LIPSTICK visible on the rim From the bg
MATRON (CONTD)

days
Beth puts the cup to her lips as

Beth looks at the board The funny-shaped pieces on the green
and white squares He glances at her then back to the board

Beth moves to the far side of the basement and clops the
erasers together watching the janitor the entire time

She stares at the man through the billowing cloud of chalk
dust growing all around her--

The janitor is in his fifties heavyset nothing particularly
friendly about him MR SHAIBEL

She finishes the job and starts to leave this time crossing
closer to the game getting a good look at THE BOARD as she

BETH
I don’t want to be with the others
I want to know what game you’re
playing

He looks up at her a moment then shrugs

MR SHAIBEL
It’s called chess

She takes a step back and he resumes his game Beth watches
as he stares at the pieces Motionless As if he hates them

She watches him reach out and pick a piece up by its top with
his fingertips hold it for a moment as though holding a dead
mouse by the tail and then set it on another square

BETH
Will you teach me

Mr Shaibel says nothing doesn’t even register the question
All we get are the DISTANT SINGING VOICES She tries again

BETH (CONT’D)
I want to learn to play chess

pieces picks it up deftly by its head and sets it down on a
square on the other side of the board Not looking at her--

space to move in But that one can

mortal loss when he reaches out and stops her hand--

MR SHAIBEL

Resign

MR SHAIBEL
That’s right child When you lose
the queen that way you resign

She stares at him Not comprehending He lets go of her hand
picks up her black king and sets it on its side on the board
It rolls back and forth a moment finally lays still

BETH
No

MR SHAIBEL
Yes You have resigned the game

BETH
You didn’t tell me that in the

INT BASEMENT - DAY 63
She goes down the stairs comes around the corner to see Mr
Shaibel sitting at the chessboard the pieces ready Beth
begins cleaning the erasers Risks glancing at him--

Mr Shaibel nods to the board As if nothing happened

She hesitates then comes over and sits down across from him
He’s already made the first move They begin to play

They say nothing to each other but respond quickly to the
other’s moves Beth glances up at him can see tension and
likes it She begins to push a pawn toward the sixth rank

He responds Moves his knight She moves the pawn He moves
his knight back She smiles at the wasted move trades her

bishop for the knight Soon her pawn is one move away from
becoming a queen

He looks at it sitting there Reaches out and angrily topples
his king Neither of them says anything But it’s her first
win and we see on her face that it feels pretty damn good

MR SHAIBEL
You’re gloating

BETH
I’m not

MR SHAIBEL
It was close

BETH
I still beat you

MR SHAIBEL
You could have beat me sooner
(then)
You should learn the Sicilian
Defense

BETH
What’s that

He reaches for the board--

MR SHAIBEL
When white moves to king four
black does this

He moves the pieces on the board into position

BETH
Then what

He moves the knight as--

MR SHAIBEL
Knight to KB 3

BETH
What’s KB 3

MR SHAIBEL

King’s bishop 3 Where I just put

the knight

MR SHAIBEL
From now on we take turns It’s the
way the game should be played

BETH
Then how come I couldn’t go first
before

He doesn’t answer nods to the board Move She moves the
king’s pawn Her eyes remain fixed on the board as they play
Whatever she’d been feeling only a few moments earlier is
gone she’s all killer now

He looks up at her the barest glance then back down at the
board It’s not long before--

BETH (CONTD)
Check

Another glance He moves And then--

BETH (CONT’D)

He looks up at her but doesn’t scowl like he usually does
when she beats him Instead he reaches to the floor for a
nearly empty pint bottle Tilts his head back and drinks

BETH (CONTD)
Is that whiskey

MR SHAIBEL
Yes child And don’t tell

BETH
I wont

She follows the bottle as he sets it back down on the floor
now grabs a heavy PAPERBACK off a shelf and hands it to her

BETH (CONT’D)

MR SHAIBEL
It’s the best book for you It will
tell you what you want to know

Beth begins turning the pages and we glimpse headings such as

the other scribbles on the walls

Fear is just a phantom

She shuts off the light and lies back down with Beth Rambles

MR SHAIBEL
We play at a club

MR GANZ
I’m also coach of the high school
team Duncan High

She shakes her head doesn’t know it

MR GANZ (CONT’D)
Would you like to play me a game

In answer Beth sits down on the milk crate Mr Shaibel
eases himself into a folding chair beside the board as Mr
Ganz takes the janitor’s usual stool across from her

He reaches forward in a quick nervous movement and picks up
one black and one white pawn He cups his hand around them
shakes them together then extends both arms towards Beth
his fists clenched She just looks at him

MR SHAIBEL
You play the color you choose

She reaches out and barely touches Mr Ganz’s left hand

BETH
This one

He opens it to reveal the black pawn Smiles--

MR GANZ
Sorry

Mr Ganz puts the pawns back and rotates the board He makes
a move She calmly responds PAN AWAY NOW TO MR SHAIBEL WHO
watches intently almost nervously His glances alternating
between the board and Beth PAN PAST MR GANZ who no longer
smiles After a few more moves he lays down his King

MR GANZ (CONTD)
Well
(quick glance at Mr
Shaibel then)
You certainly know the game young
lady Do you have a team here

She looks at him uncomprehending 76

MR GANZ (CONT’D)
The other girls Do they have a
chess club

BETH
No

MR GANZ
Then where do you play

BETH
Down here

MR GANZ
Mr Shaibel said you play a few

Mr Ganz stares at the board She demonstrates Looks up at
him As does Mr Shaibel Mr Ganz topples his king shakes
his head in disbelief

MR GANZ
I’ve never seen anything like it

He stands up and walks to the furnace where Beth now sees a
SMALL SHOPPING BAG hanging

MR GANZ (CONT’D)
I have to go now But I brought you
a present

He hands her the shopping bag She looks inside no doubt
hoping to see another chess book Something is wrapped in
pink tissue paper

MR GANZ (CONTD)
Go ahead Unwrap it

She lifts it out pulls away the loosely wrapped paper to
reveal A PINK DOLL in a blue print dress with blond hair
puckered up mouth Beth holds it by the arm a moment and
looks at it

MR GANZ (CONTD)
Well

She sees Mr Shaibel giving her a look

BETH
Thank you very much

You should have green leafy
vegetables at least once a day
legumes a few times a week and
stay away from tobacco and any and
all forms of alcohol They will
counter all the good effects and
vitamins you get from greens I
also like to inspect my stool at
least three times a week It should
appear firm but not hard a clear
sign of dehydration

GIGGLES Beth stares at the HEALTH BOOK on her desk has
flipped to the back One page is a woman and the facing page
is a man Line drawings with shadings Beth stares at the

She looks out the window as Mr Hume drones on The pink
Japonicas are blooming She looks at the trees a moment
Trying to make sense of the pictures she’s just seen

children already heading back inside behind her

MRS DEARDORFF (CONT’D)

INT GIRLS WARD - NIGHT 80

Beth takes several of the green pills Lies back and begins
to play on the ceiling

MR GANZ (VO)
I brought my own set

CUT TO A WOODEN BOX 81

As it’s opened to reveal polished wooden chess pieces nestled
in red felt As they’re lifted out we WIDEN TO REVEAL

THE BASEMENT A chess board of black and white squares now
set up on the table Nobody speaks while

Mr Shaibel having set up his board in the usual place now
sets another milk crate for Mr Ganz’s board the two boards
side by side Beth sits on a crate in the foot or so of space
between them None of them speak

Beth reaches out and hefts one of the wooden knights feels
the weight of it looks at the fine wood grain the felt at
the bottom She instantly wants this chess set

Mr Ganz gently takes back the knight from Beth’s hand and
sets it on its home square

MR GANZ
We thought you could play us both

BETH
At the same time

He nods She has white for both games She makes a move on
each board As they both respond She doesn’t even have to
pause to think about the continuations for either board

She makes her moves and now looks out the window and waits
She seems deeply relaxed almost in a dream

MR GANZ
Beth I’ve moved my bishop to
bishop 5

BETH

(not looking)
Knight to K-5

He nods studies the board moves-—-

MR GANZ
Bishop to Knight four

BETH
Queen to queen four

81

She still hasn’t looked at the board The bush and its pink
blossoms outside the high window has her attention

MR SHAIBEL
Knight to queen’s bishop three

BETH
Bishop to knight five

As opposed to Mr Shaibel’s gruff tone Mr Ganz’s voice now
has a strange softness

MR GANZ
Pawn to knight three

BETH
Queen to rook four check

Behind her JUST OUT OF FOCUS Mr Ganz inhales sharply A
moment then--

MR GANZ
King to bishop one

BETH
(still not turning)
That’s mate in three First check
is with the knight The king has
the two dark squares and the
bishop checks it Then the knight
mates

MR GANZ
Sweet Jesus

He shakes his head checks his watch

MR GANZ (CONT’D)
I have to go now

He stands grabs his satchel remembers something pulls out
a CAMERA looks at Beth

MR GANZ (CONTD)
Would you mind Beth if I took
your picture I’d love to tell the
kids in the chess club about you

She’s not sure Looks at Mr Shaibel
MR GANZ (CONTD)
How about you stand beside Mr
Shaibel

She gets up moves to Mr Shaibel’s side Both are awkward
She rests her hand on his shoulder Startling him 81

Jolene notes the closeness of his lean gives him a look as
Beth gets up and follows Fergussen out of the room--

Beth closes the door looks at Mrs Deardorff seated at the
desk peering at her over tortoise shell glasses

MRS DEARDORFF (CONT’D)

She looks at Mr Ganz

MR GANZ

MRS DEARDORFF

maintains that you are a phenomenal
chess player He would like you to

BETH
In a what

MR GANZ
At the same time

MRS DEARDORFF
We like to give our girls a chance
for experience outside whenever we
can
Beth looks at her Really

MRS DEARDORFF (CONT’D)

But I am a bit wary of letting
Elizabeth go off to the local high
school

MR GANZ

I would chaperone I’d pick her up
and bring her to the school then
bring her straight back here

MRS DEARDORFF
I was thinking a young lady might
also accompany her

MR GANZ
I assumed that you would come As
my guest

Beth watches as Mrs Deardorff blushes at that one
MRS DEARDORFF

Oh no I couldn’t possibly
abandon my duties here 84

MR GANZ
Well then what if Shirley Munson
club treasurer and one of my best
students comes along

Mrs Deardorff processes that a moment--

MR GANZ (CONTD)
I’m sure I could get someone from
the local paper to be there write
it up I imagine that it could be a
very good thing fund raising wise
to have a story like this

MRS DEARDORFF
Yes I’m sure it would be

He gives her a warm smile

MRS DEARDORFF (CONT’D)
What do you say Elizabeth Do you

BETH
No
SHIRLEY

Beth nods distractedly

SHIRLEY (CONTD)
Did you know Chess is older than

BETH
No

SHIRLEY
By like four hundred years

They’re at the front door when--

JOLENE (VO)
Wait

They all turn to see Jolene come running up to them She
gives Mr Ganz one of her sly smiles

JOLENE
Is it okay if I talk to Beth for
just a second Wish her luck

MR GANZ
(checks his watch then)
Sure Go ahead

Jolene takes Beth hastily aside and puts something in Beth’s
hand Kisses her on the forehead

JOLENE
Good luck

She then waves at Mr Ganz and skips off to class Beth
looks at her hand sees THREE GREEN PILLS

INT DUNCAN HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 96
Quiet as Beth now follows Shirley and Mr Ganz through the
school She takes in the posters and banners that line the
walls The trophy cases Another world All of this--

INT DUNCAN HIGH SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY 97

A SERIES OF SHOTS-- Desks stacked in a corner Three folding
tables set up in the shape of a U in the center of the room

97

On each table are four green and beige paper chessboards with
plastic pieces Metal chairs sit inside the U facing the
black pieces And finally “WELCOME BETH HARMON” written on
the blackboard

Beth stands in the room taking it all in A BELL RINGS and
now the hallway echoes with FOOTSTEPS and SHOUTS Students
mostly boys begin to come into the classroom Some big as

men

Beth is half the size of these easy insolent students with
their loud voices and their bright sweaters The room fills
until Beth is blocked by their bodies and she disappears

MR GANZ
Take your seats and be quiet
please

As they all begin to sit and REVEAL HER ONCE MORE

MR GANZ (CONT’D)
Charles Levy will take Board Number
One since he’s our top player

Beth looks at CHARLES LEVY as he takes his proper seat

MR GANZ (CONTD)
The rest can sit where they want to
There will be no talking during play

And like that everyone is quiet and looking at Beth She
looks back at them something rising in her face Hatred

BETH
Do I start now

MR GANZ
With board number one

BETH
And then I go to the next one

MR GANZ
That’s right

She steps over to the first board where Charles Levy sits
picks up the king’s pawn and moves it to the fourth rank

She goes from board to board making the same move At one
point she hesitates as she sees no one is responding She
looks at Mr Ganz--

MR GANZ (CONT’D)
They can’t respond until you’ve
opened at every board 97

Oh She continues making her opening move on each board She
gets to the last board moves then turns and watches as
everyone responds at once She starts going around again

BETH (VO)
What surprised me was how bad they
played

INT BASEMENT - DAY 98
Beth sits across from Mr Shaibel eating a box of chocolate--
BETH

They left backward pawns all over

the place and their pieces were

wide open for forks
INT DUNCAN HIGH SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY 99
As Beth moves from board to board Boys wander in from the

hallway and line up along the back wall to watch the girl
from the orphanage

BETH (VO)
A few of them tried stupid mating
attacks
INT BASEMENT - DAY 100

Beth shrugs eats another chocolate--

BETH

This boy Charles Levy He was
supposed to be the best

INT DUNCAN HIGH SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY 101
As Beth calmly takes apart the Chess Club Number One

BETH (VO)
I had his pieces tied up in fifteen
moves I mated him in six more with
a knight-rook combination

As Beth moves from board to board the energy of her amazing
mind crackles in the room for everyone bearing witness She
beats the last player steps back and looks around her--

BETH (VO)
Mr Ganz told me that I beat them
all in an hour and twenty minutes

Captured pieces sit in clusters beside each board A few
students stare at her but most avoid her eyes They’re
afraid of her SCATTERED APPLAUSE and--

101

BETH (VO)
It felt good

INT BASEMENT - DAY 102
Beth reaches for another chocolate looks at the box
BETH
I’ve never won anything before
REVERSE ON MR SHAIBEL

Quietly watching her What’s that on his face Concern
Admiration Both Hard to say Finally--

MR SHAIBEL

She gets up slides the box his way

BETH
You can have the rest

She leaves He stares at the box Lost in thought

INT MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM - “VITAMIN LINE” - DAY 103
Looking out over Fergussen as Beth slowly approaches the
window Takes in the pills in the jar but now RACK FOCUS TO
THE PADLOCK on the window She studies the hinges and hasps
INT CAFETERIA - DAY 104

Beth sees Jolene at a table talking with another girl her age
and heads over

BETH
Jolene--

JOLENE
Hey--

BETH

JOLENE

INT BASEMENT - NIGHT 105
Dark THE LIGHT COMES ON to reveal Beth coming down the
stairs Mr Shaibel isn’t here She looks at the board
around the room sees the TOOLS hanging on the pegboard
opposite the furnace

INT LIBRARY - DAY 106

The Saturday movie The Robe plays for the entirety of the
Methuen Home The staff sit in a row of chairs at the back

Beth slouches in her chair can barely focus on the movie
Her legs crossed angrily in that double cross over

She glances back at the faculty and staff spies Fergussen
near the door proctoring She gets up and edges her way to
him and whispers

BETH
Bathroom

He nods his eyes along with everyone else’s on Victor
Mature bare-chested in the arena

INT CORRIDOR - SAME 107
She hurries down the hallway slips into--

INT MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM - SAME 108
She moves past the racks of Christian Endeavour magazines and
the Readers Digest Condensed Books to the far wall and the
pad-locked window that says PHARMACY

She grabs one of the wooden stools from the room and drags it
to the window She climbs onto it so her face is level with a

HASP and PADLOCK

There’s no one in the room so the only sounds are the
gladiatorial shouts from the movie in the library

108

The window up close is made of frosted glass with chicken
wire in it and framed in painted wood Beth examines the
screws that hold the painted hasp

The shouts from the film arena rises to a roar and the
volume of the frenetic music rises with it

She puts the blade of the screwdriver in the slit of the
screw and twists it as hard as she can Nothing happens

She grips the screwdriver in both hands hunches her
shoulders together and twists with all she has

SOMETHING SQUEAKS and the screw loosens She keeps twisting
until she can take it out the rest of the way and put it in
her blouse pocket

Now she goes to work on the other screw She gets that one
out and puts it in her pocket The end of the hasp comes
loose by itself with the padlock still hanging there the
other end supported by the two screws that hold it to the
window frame

She pulls open the window leaning back so it can go by her
and puts her head inside The light’s off but she can see
the outline of the big jar She puts her arms inside the
opening stands on tiptoe pushes herself as far forward as
she can until her belly is on the sill

She begins to wriggle and her feet come away from the stool
She keeps on wriggling forward feels and hears her blouse
ripping on the sharp edge of the sill but keeps going

Her hands finally reach the narrow metal table just below the
window She inches forward again and her weight comes down on
her hands She pushes a few boxes aside and makes a place for
herself on the table

She lets her weight come forward until she’s able to flop
onto the table twisting at the last moment so that she
doesn’t fall off it

She takes a couple of deep breaths and climbs down There’s
enough light for her to see alright She walks to the far
wall and faces the dimly visible JAR

She lifts the glass cover and sits it silently on the table
under the window She then slowly reaches inside with both
hands burying them up to the wrists She takes a deep breath
and removes her right hand with a fistful of pills

She doesn’t count them but simply puts them in her mouth and
swallows them ALL

She stuffs three handfuls of pills into her skirt pocket She
looks around 108

On the wall beside the window is a DIXIE CUP DISPENSER She’s
able to reach it on tiptoe and pulls down four paper cups

She fills them one at a time Then steps back and looks at
the jar The level is now half of what it was Whatever

She moves to the door to go out that way but can’t open it
It’s locked in some serious way and she’s now a bit unsteady
She looks at the four Dixie cups and then at the window How
can she climb out with them

She grips the doorknob Controls her breathing Carries the
cups two at a time to the table under the window She looks
back at the jar At the remaining pills And thinks

She takes the jar to the table and pours the contents of the
Dixie cups back inside She climbs onto the table and puts
her head out the window into the empty multi purpose room

The jar of pills is only inches from her knee She wriggles
her way through the window and onto the stool Standing up
high there she leans forward and dreamily grabs the jar by
the rim in both hands

She goes limp stares down at the green pills in the jar
STATELY MUSIC now coming from the library She lies there
over the sill like a rag doll

As her eyes lose focus the green in the jar becomes a bright
luminous blur--

WOMANS VOICE
Elizabeth

BETH
Mama

WOMANS VOICE
Elizabeth

She hoists the jar in a kind of slow motion lifting it with
both hands as she turns the bottom of the jar hitting the
window ledge with a dull ringing sound and coming loose from
her hands and--

IN HER STONED POV

--exploding on the edge of the stool at her feet The
fragments mixed with hundreds of green pellets cascading to
the linoleum floor Bits of glass caught like rhinestones and
lay in place while the green pills roll outward like a bright
waterfall toward Mrs Deardorff

MRS DEARDORFF
Elizabeth 108

Behind her stands Fergussen in his white pants and T-shirt
Next to him stands the other teachers and behind them
crowding to see what had happened are the other children

All of them staring at her high on the miniature stage of
her stool with her hands a foot apart as though she’s still
holding the jar

INT GIRLS’ WARD - DAY 109

Beth wakes up She’s alone in the Girl’s Ward The only one
in bed Fergussen comes to the door--

She blinks at him looks around Swallows winces--

BETH

BETH

Beth sees her clothes at the foot of the bed She’s putting
them on when she reaches into her pocket and makes a
discovery TWENTY-SOME PILLS STILL INSIDE So many she has to
take her toothbrush out of the holder to get them all in

MRS DEARDORFF (VO)
I pray you’ve learned your lesson

110 INT MRS DEARDORFF’S OFFICE - DAY 110

Beth stands facing Mrs Deardorff Several of her teachers

profound shock to all of us

deplorable It must not happen

BETH
I can’t sleep without the pills

MRS DEARDORFF
All the more reason why you should
not have them

BETH

of the empty beds sits under the window It’s a bit larger
than the others and has more space around it

FERGUSSEN (CONTD)

nightstand

She looks at him Really

She looks around the ward This is the best bed in the ward
Fergussen is making a note on his clipboard when she reaches
out and touches his arm--

INT CORRIDOR - DAY 119

The kids all come out of class Beth looks down the corridor
and sees Mr Shaibel at the end of the long hallway mopping

While the kids go the other way towards the door that leads
to the yard for recess she starts down the hallway to him

She stops where the floor is wet and stands for a good long
while before he finally looks up at her

BETH
They won’t let me play anymore I’m
sorry
(he says nothing)
I’m being punished I--

She looks at his face It registers nothing

BETH (CONTD)
Please Mr Shaibel

She touches his arm He freezes

BETH (CONT’D)
Can you help me

He looks at her for a moment as if he’s going to speak But
instead he resumes mopping Beth watches him then--

BETH (CONTD)
I wish I could play more with you

She then turns and walks back down the hall She watches as
he mops his way to the end then glances once her way and
then drops the mop in the bucket and opens a door--

Beth stands there in the hallway watching as he rolls the
bucket inside the door shutting behind him She stares at
the door another moment then turns and runs away
