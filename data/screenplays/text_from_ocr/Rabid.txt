EXT HILLY COUNTRY ROAD -- DAY

A large black powerful-looking motorcycle waits propped up
on its center stand on the gravel shoulder of a deserted
country road The gold lettering on its tank and side covers
identifies it as a Norton Commando 850

Two white Bell full-coverage helmets sit on its saddle like
medieval jousting helmets

Beyond the motorcycle stretched out on a grassy rise lie
Hart Read twenty-six and his long-time girlfriend Rose
who is the kind of eighteen that often seems more like
fifteen and once in a while like twelve

At the moment Rose is definitely eighteen and in control of
things producing tuna sandwiches with lettuce and mayonnaise
out of a string bag and pouring coffee pre-mixed with sugar
and milk from a small thermos flask Read watches her play
housewife with vast amusement Rose holds out a sandwich

READ
Whatve we got Rose Steak on a
bun

ROSE

Tuna with lettuce and mayo You gonna
make trouble

READ
Yeah Big trouble

He grabs Roses wrist and pulls her close He looks her deep
in the eyes

READ
I want steak

Read kisses her full on the mouth Rose drops the sandwich
into the grass

READ
Steak

They kiss passionately
EXT HILLY COUNTRY ROAD -- DAY -- ONE HOUR LATER

Read kicks the big Norton into life Rose puts on her helmet
does up the chin strap and gets on the machine behind Read
Read waits for her to get settled blips the throttle then
accelerates off the shoulder of the road fishtailing slightly
in the gravel

EXT HILLY COUNTRY ROAD -- DAY

The Norton booms along the twisty two-lane road The road is
clear and Read feels good He opens the throttle even more
almost becoming airborne over the crest of a steep rise and
leaning the bike over in the corners until he scrapes rubber
off the footpegs

Rose rides loose completely at ease behind Read She clasps
her arms around him loosely always going with the motion of
the machine closing her eyes in pleasure

EXT HILLY COUNTRY ROAD -- DAY

Further up the road a neat white VW pop-top camper trundles
along in the opposite direction carrying a middle-aged man

his wife and their twelve-year-old daughter They are city

slickers out for an autumn camping jaunt and things are not
going well for them

WIFE
(scrutinizing crumpled
map)

We passed it

MAN
We didnt pass it I remember that
farm

WIFE

We passed it That farm comes after
concession road 12 and we were
supposed to turn at concession road

KID
I dont remember that farm Dad

MAN
We didnt pass it I very distinctly
remember that farm

WIFE
If you would just stop this vehicle
long enough to take a look at the
map I will prove to you beyond any
shadow of a doubt that we

MAN
(losing his temper)
All right

The man swings the camper across both lanes in one furious
motion and slams on the brakes just before they go over the
edge of the road into a ditch bordering an open field

MAN
Youre both right and Im all wrong

He slams the camper into reverse and backs up as far as he
can then slams it into first and lurches forward trying
vainly to make a clean three-point turn on the narrow road

MAN
Well turn around and go all the way
back

When the camper is stretched completely across both lanes of
the highway it stalls The man twists the key viciously but
it wont restart

MAN
Goddamn thing Shoulda never sold
the goddamn station wagon

KID
The station wagon used to use too
much gas remember Dad

WIFE
You keep quiet when your dads ina
sweat Valerie

MAN

(still trying to start

the camper)
Goddamn thing Shoulda never sold
the wagon

Without warning Reads bike suddenly appears over the crest
of the hill just beyond the camper The bike is nearing 100
miles an hour The wife sees it first
WIFE
Oh Christ Bob

MAN
(looking up)
Huh Oh Christ

here is no place for Read to go except off the road The
ike shoots over the drainage ditch beside the road two feet
rom the nose of the camper The man and his wife sit with
heir mouths open watching through their front windshield
he bike fly through the air into an overgrown field as
hough it were happening on TV

tatthoxu

EXT FIELD -- DAY

When the bike finally lands in the field it hits down front
wheel first The impact slams Read over the handlebars into
the trunk of a small but solid tree Rose stays with the
machine for one complete cartwheel The motorcycle ends up
on top of her the tank across her belly Before she can
move the tank explodes into flames The flames begin to
melt the plastic visor of her helmet

EXT EDGE OF THE FIELD -- DAY

The camper driver turns around in his seat and starts to
rummage around looking for something to put out the fire
His wife gets hysterical She can see Rose trying vainly to
get out from under the bike

WIFE
Oh my God Shes gonna burn Shes
gonna die

MAN
Wheres the kids blanket Wheres
the kids goddamn blanket
EXT TERRACE OF KELOID CLINIC -- DAY

Jackie a cool blonde English woman in her early forties
has been bird-watching from the clinics terrace Something
startling attracts her attention

JACKIE
I dont believe it

Lloyd Walsh an actor in his late thirties in the Keloid
Clinic of Cosmetic Surgery for his second facial touch-up
pauses in the middle of a sit-up which he is performing on
an exercise mat a few yards away Walsh is wearing a blue
jogging outfit whose top bears the words JOGGING KILLS
His head is bandaged

WALSH
What is it You spot a rare tufted
tit-mouse or somethin

Jackie turns away from her binoculars She has thin surgical
wires attached to the upper and lower eyelids of both eyes

JACKIE
Theres a motorcycle burning in the
middle of a field I think theres
somebody under it

Walsh jumps to his feet with exaggerated athletic vigor

WALSH
Yeah Lemme have a look

Jackie hands Walsh her binoculars and points him in the right
general direction

JACKIE
See that column of smoke Just follow
it down to its source

We look through the binoculars with him as he does so Sure
enough there is a bike burning in a field with someone
trapped beneath it

WALSH
Wow Lookit that

He turns and begins to sprint for the stairway at the end of
the terrace

JACKIE
Where are you going

WALSH
Gonna tell the boys downstairs Its
right up their alley

JACKIE
Oh
(calling after the
disappearing Walsh)

Careful with my binoculars Theyre
very expensive

INT CLINIC BOARDROOM -- DAY

The three partners who own and operate the Keloid Clinic are

holding an in

formal meeting in the posh boardroom of the

clinic with cigars (Cypher) cigarettes coffee and full

ashtrays much

Involved are

key but force
successful so
who is hersel
and Murray Cy
eight dapper
passionately

in evidence

Dr Daniel Keloid a youthful forty-five low-
ful founder of the Keloid Clinic and extremely
ciety plastic surgeon Keloids wife Roxanne
f an MD and who was once a student of Keloids
pher the clinics accountant Cypher is forty-
generally enthusiastic and believes

in creative accounting

It has apparently been a long and tiring session Cypher in
particular shows signs of strain His end of the table is

littered with
scrawled note

As far

pages of scratch pad covered with hastily
s and figures

CYPHER
as Im concerned these guys

are completely legit The bank is
just as convinced as I am They told
me theyre willing to go all the way
with us Im telling you Danny -- a
franchise operation for plastic
surgery resorts is one of those
magnificent inevitable ideas

KELOID

Banks are always quick to say that
when everythings rolling easy But
you can take it from me -- first

sign of heat from the medical
association first cries of
professional outrage and the bank1ll
call back its note and leave us
hanging by our thumbs

ROXANNE

Its not the financing thats
bothering you Dan Your voice has
that edge to it
KELOID
Ive never denied it I sure as hell
dont want to become the Colonel
Sanders of plastic surgery

CYPHER
Why not Sounds great to me

KELOID
Ill tell you why not Because its
unprofessional unmedical and
unsavory

CYPHER
You thought of it

KELOID
I was only kidding

CYPHER
You were not Besides you want me
to go back and tell three of the
largest investment groups in North
America Forget it He was only
kidding

KELOID

(in only partially

mock despair)
Oh God Its all gotten out of hand
I can see it now fifty enfranchised
Keloids Cosmetic Surgery Clinics
flung across the face of North America
like Holiday Inns Next thing you
know Do-It-Yourself Facelift Kits

CYPHER
I like it We could call it we
could call it Suture Self

(starts to scribble

madly)
No Im serious I like that Theres
got to be a way

ROXANNE
All right boys I think were getting
a bit silly
The office intercom on the table chimes and the voice of

Steve

The intercom chimes off as Keloid stands up to leave

an orderly fills the room

STEVE (VO)
Is Dr Keloid there Its urgent

KELOID
Yeah what is it Steve

STEVE (VO)
Theres been a motorcycle accident a
few minutes down the highway here
Looks like a couple of people have
been hurt Should I take the van and
go get â€˜em

KELOID
Yeah sure

(short pause)
Hey wait a minute Steve You still
there

STEVE (VO)
Yeah

KELOID
Hang on till I get there OK Im
coming with you Meet you at the
garage

STEVE (VO)
Roger

throws his pen on the table

He closes the door behind him

ROXANNE

(exasperated)
Oh now Dan Weve got a lot of
decisions to make

KELOID

(leaving)
You and Murray work it out hon
Just make the pill easy for me to
swallow OK

their own devices

Cypher

leaving Cypher and Roxanne to
CYPHER
Well what do you think about facelift
kits Roxy I mean theyve got
abortion kits

ROXANNE

(frustrated)
Lets just forget that anybody ever
mentioned the idea OK Murray

Cypher shrugs It still sounds great to him
EXT CLINIC DRIVEWAY -- DAY

In the middle of a landscaped triangle of lawn stands a large
light-box-style sign which reads KELOID CLINIC OF COSMETIC
SURGERY Along one side of the triangle runs a crushed-gravel
driveway at the end of which is a long low garage just behind
the main building which looks as though it might once have
been a small stable

One of the three doors of the garage slides up and a van
peels rubber out of the garage sliding a bit once it hits
the gravel The van is set up inside and out exactly like a
standard big-city ambulance but without any ambulance
markings Instead sedate white lettering on the doors reads
KELOID CLINIC LTD

EXT FIELD -- DAY

Read lies crumpled at the base of the tree The end of his

right collarbone is sticking out at a bizarre angle and his
right shoulder is hanging too low Read has regained enough
consciousness to feebly undo his helmet with his left hand

Beyond him clouds of oily black smoke curl skywards from
the fallen Norton Read can hardly focus his eyes on the
figures running toward them from the camper at the edge of
the field He slips dreamily into unconsciousness

INT VAN -- DAY
The clinic van turns off a secondary road on to the two-lane
highway and accelerates furiously tossing its occupants

around as it momentarily slews sideways

In the back of the van are Steve who is busily preparing
stretchers and oxygen and Dr Keloid
Keloid prepares several hypodermic syringes while expertly
bracing himself against the motion of the van

Steve finishes attaching a hose to a small cylinder of oxygen
and turns the release valve to test the oxygen flow through
the nose-piece

STEVE
Well weve got oxygen now Dr
Keloid

Keloid watches the thin column of black smoke looming larger
through the windshield of the van He reaches for a small
fire extinguisher affixed to the frame of the van and begins
to undo the clamps holding it there

KELOID
I think were going to have to use
this before we get close enough for
the oxygen Steve

EXT FIELD -- DAY

Rose has stopped moving under the flaming machine The man
from the camper running and stumbling over the uneven ground
finally arrives followed by his older son (who is about
thirteen) The man tries vainly to smother the flames with
his younger sons blanket but the heat is too intense for
him to get really close

The man is almost in tears with horror and frustration His
son just stares wide-eyed

EXT EDGE OF FIELD -- DAY

The clinic van bounces to a halt by the edge of the field
and the driver the most junior of the clinics four
orderlies jumps out and runs around to the back of the van

he back doors swing open and Keloid jumps out with the fire
xtinguisher in one hand and a small leather bag in the other
e heads for the flames as the wife and her kid watch from

he front seats of the camper The wife sticks her head out

f the window and points at the flames

odmarxH

WIFE
(to Keloid)
Theyre over there Doctor They
were speeding
Keloid is soon followed by the two orderlies carrying a large
wheeled stretcher which they have hauled from the back of

the van

EXT FIELD -- DAY

The man who was driving the camper is still making sporadic
attempts to beat out the flames with the blanket when Keloid
arrives and opens up the valve of the fire extinguisher The
white powdery foam covers everything in a few seconds killing
the flames easily

MAN

(to Keloid)

I tried to put it out I couldnt
get near it

Keloid kneels beside Rose He takes a pair of scissors from
his bag and cuts the helmet strap under her chin He slips

the helmet off her head with great care Her long blonde

hair falls into a pool around her face which seems remarkably
at peace and untouched only a rectangle of black soot where
her helmets visor melted away and admitted smoke gives any
indication of what shes gone through

When the orderlies arrive the man points out Read for them

MAN
Theres another one over there I
saw him movin around a minute ago

KELOID

(to orderlies)
Might as well go get him We wont
be ready to move her for a few
minutes

The orderlies trot off toward Read with their stretcher The
man watches them leave then turns back to look at Rose He
shakes his head as Keloid gives her an injection

MAN
Christ I didnt know it was a girl
Is she dead

KELOID
This isnt embalming fluid Im
shooting into her See if you can
lift the machine off her Use the
blanket around your hands Its hot

The man wraps the blanket around his hands and begins to
half-pull half-slide the Norton off Rose by the handlebars
The orderlies go by on their way to the van with Read
unconscious on the stretcher

As the bike slides away to reveal Roses abdomen the man
recoils in horror

MAN
My God

EXT COUNTRY ROAD -- DAY
The clinic van speeds along the road toward the clinic
INT VAN -- DAY

Rose is on the stretcher with intravenous tubes in her arms
bottles hanging over her head an oxygen mask over her mouth
and nose and several layers of blood-soaked bandages and
surgical gauze over her abdomen The senior orderly monitors
the oxygen flow the IV levels and Roses pulse while Keloid
speaks to someone at the clinic over the vans CB radio

which has a telephone-style speaker receiver

Read sits jammed into a small seat behind the driver his
head back against the van wall completely dazed He is
conscious enough to wince in pain with every bump the van
hits but he obviously doesnt know where he is or why hes
there

KELOID
Roxanne Yeah listen Were going
to have to throw in everything weve
got I know but let me tell you
what were looking at The gas tank
exploded over the girls abdomen and
I dont know what shes got left in
there The mans got a broken hand
separated shoulder concussion the
usual We can send him to the General
But its definitely major surgery
for her and right now I know were
not but weve got no choice Id
say shes got a half hour to live

and its three hours to the nearest
serious hospital Its us or nobody
Yeah I hope I can remember too
Well they say its like riding a
bicycle

EXT CLINIC DRIVEWAY -- DAY

The van stops in front of the clinic and the orderlies jump
out Keloid holds the bottles and the oxygen as the orderlies
unload the stretcher and roll it up the front walk of the
clinic which is a spectacularly renovated old farmhouse --
all sandblasted auburn brick pine and cedar planking white
paint and Vista Vision windows

A group composed of patients and staff cluster around the
main doors of the clinic to watch as the stretcher approaches
Nobody seems to notice Read who has been left sitting in

the van

INT CLINIC ENTRANCE -- DAY

Lloyd Walsh holds open one of the main glass doors while a
nurse opens the other one The secretary -- receptionist
abandons her phones and her sleek plastic deskfiling cabinet
module to work her way through the group at the doors in
order to take a look

Walsh makes room for the secretary -- Sheila -- beside him

Rose is wheeled through the doors Her condition is so
obviously serious and so different from the usual â€˜touch-up
jobs done at the Keloid Clinic which has a carefully
calculated country resort atmosphere about it that everyone
becomes completely silent as she enters

KELOID

(to nurse at door)
Get the guy in the van into
observation and check him out But
take it easy -- concussion separated
shoulder broken hand OK Louise
Maybe some Demerol when he becomes
lucid

LOUISE
OK Dr Keloid

Louise leaves the door once the stretcher has gone by and
heads out to the van Walsh lets go of his door and jogs
after her

Jackie still wearing sunglasses shakes her head as she
watches the stretcher go off down the hall and turns to the
middle-aged lady standing next to her

JACKIE
What a waste She doesnt even need
a nose job

INT CLINIC HALLWAY -- DAY

The orderlies wheel the stretcher down a hallway which was
patently never meant to be used as a hospital corridor Rose
is getting a very rough ride As they move along they pass
various patients who react with shock and horror when they
see Rose The Keloid Clinic is usually more discreet about
blood than a normal hospital

MAN
(as Rose passes)
Jesus wept Whats that all about

WOMAN
Somebody said something about an
accident

MAN

(repulsed)
Couldnt they throw a sheet over it
or something Im starting to feel
like Im in a hospital

The fastidious man and his companion go through some doors
which according to an elegantly lettered sign on a wall
lead to a squash court

The orderlies stop in front of another set of doors Keloid
hands one of them the bottles he has been holding as a second
nurse Rita comes out to meet them Rita is a very solid
square-bodied fortyish lady

KELOID
OK boys Take her into pre-op and
tell Dr Karl to set her up for the
works

INT SURGICAL WASH-UP -- DAY
Keloid and Roxanne wash with disinfectant in preparation for
Roses operation aided by a third orderly whom we have not
seen before

Roxanne is short dark intense and ambitious beyond her
present practice She does not wear her thirty-seven years
particularly well so the age difference between her and her
husband seems more theoretical than anything else She is
very particular about being called by her maiden name and is
known as Dr Rushton to all the clinics patients At the
moment Keloid and Roxanne are having a very controlled low-
key argument which Roxanne tries to keep the orderly from
hearing

ROXANNE
I dont buy it Dan

KELOID
You havent seen her

ROXANNE
I dont have to see her Neutral
field grafts have never been used
internally We could end up with a
terminal cancer patient on our hands

KELOID
Aw cmon We can monitor Roxy
hes got nothing to lose Literally
he doesnt have enough small
ntestine left to absorb nutrient
f we just close her up shell have
o be fed intravenously for the rest
f her life which will be a short
nd a dismal one But if we graft
eutral field tissue cones into the
bdominal cavity theres a chance
that theyll read her condition by
post-embryonic induction and develop
into a new set of intestines

9DAMAOtHENN

ROXANNE
Or run wild and make some very
creative malignant tumors Dan the
clinic doesnt need this Lets play
it safe

Keloid doesnt respond He finishes snapping on his surgical
gloves and turns to the scrub-nurse who helps him on with
his sterilized operating tunic

INT OBSERVATION ROOM -- DAY

Read has regained full consciousness in the clinics
observation room and is watching Louise cut away his well-
worn leather motorcycle jacket with a pair of snub-nosed
surgical scissors She cuts her way up the right sleeve to
the shoulder then across the shoulder to the collar She is
then able to slip the jacket easily away from Reads right
shoulder which is still very obviously not where it should
be She now starts in on his Norton T-shirt which is all he
was wearing underneath his jacket

READ
Oh no Not the T-shirt Rose gave
me the T-shirt

LOUISE
I think youd find it pretty painful
trying to take if off the standard
way

Read makes an attempt to slip his arm out of his T-shirt but
immediately gives up grimacing in pain

READ
No look I think I can Ow Oh
Youre right Cut the thing off
Ill put it up on the wall of my
garage

Louise continues snipping off the T-shirt

READ
So when do I get to see Rose

LOUISE
Not for a while

READ
Why not

Louise doesnt answer
Read pulls away from Louise and tries to stand up He cant

keep his balance and falls back against the wall banging
his wrecked shoulder
READ
I want to see her right now Ow Oh
God I didnt kill her did I

Louise reaches for a syringe of Demerol

LOUISE
Shes not dead

READ
What is that stuff I dont want you
to put me out

LOUISE
Its just Demerol Itll ease the
pain All right

Read lets Louise take his good arm She swabs him down and
sinks the needle in

READ

(sarcastically)
Sure Wonderful Anything to ease
the pain

INT OPERATING ROOM -- DAY

Keloid and Roxanne are well into their operation on Rose
assisted by a team of five which includes Dr William Karl
the clinics anesthetist Keloid and Roxanne are in the
process of cutting large squares of skin from Roses thighs

KELOID
Now I know everyone here is familiar
with the standard techniques of skin
grafting but what were going to do
is a little out of the ordinary
Ill explain it as we go Were
removing full-thickness skin grafting
material from the patients thighs
as per normal graft acquisition
procedure However before these
grafts are applied to the damaged
areas of the patients breasts
abdomen and so on they will be
treated so that they become
morphogenetically neutral They are
then called neutral field grafts

KARL
Can we treat the graft material here
Dr Keloid

KELOID

No Dr Karl The graft tissue will
be frozen and sent to the Sperling
Institute Well have to keep the
patient in an operation-ready state
until it comes back to us Thats
going to be a bit trying for all of
us but it cant be helped

As Keloid speaks the sections of thigh skin are placed in
spun aluminum cylinders of the same general type as those
used in eye banks The cylinders are then sealed and placed
in a medical freezer

RITA
I dont understand the functional
difference between neutral field and
normal graft tissue Doctor

KELOID
Well when the thigh skin tissue is
treated Nurse Benedetto itll lose
its specificity as both thigh tissue
and skin tissue For example if it
were grafted to a burned cheek it
wouldnt just be thigh skin with the
color and texture of thigh skin --
it would actually develop as facial
tissue In other words neutral field
tissue has the same ability to form
any part of the human body that the
tissue of a human embryo has

KARL
Doctor this patient has lost most
of her absorptive intestinal mucosa
Could neutral field tissue reconstruct
an organ as complex as the small
intestine

KELOID
Yes Dr Karl I think that under
the right circumstances it could
Ive done it myself using lab animals
at the Sperling Institute
Keloid and Roxanne exchange glances then Keloid looks away

KELOID
Let me add that there is always a
possibility that carcinomas will
form when neutral field grafts are
used internally In this case were
using a radical plastic-surgery
technique to compensate for our lack
of heavy medical hardware Were
doing it to save a life Its the
only trick weve got

EXT KELOID CLINIC -- DAY

Wide shot of exterior front of the Keloid Clinic in late
autumn

SLOW DISSOLVE TO
EXT KELOID CLINIC -- ONE MONTH LATER -- DAY

Same shot as previous scene one month later Snow is on the
ground and the trees are bare

SLOW DISSOLVE TO
INT ROSES ROOM AT THE KELOID CLINIC -- DAY

Read stands over Roses bed which is a very well-disguised
hospital bed (everything possible is done to keep the clinic
from feeling like a hospital) Reads left hand is encased

in a wire cage which supports all his fingers He is watching
Rose intently who is still in a coma and is attached to a
battery of intravenous bottles connected to her by clear
vinyl tubes and IV needles Read is particularly fascinated
by Roses eyes which he can see moving around wildly behind
her eyelids

He bends close then kisses her gently on her pale dry lips
INT CLINIC HALLWAY -- DAY

Nurse Louise walks briskly down a hall toward Roses room

On her way she passes Judy Glasberg clutching a pocket edition
of The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud and strolling
thoughtfully in the opposite direction
LOUISE
Hi Judy Glasberg You back again

JUDY
Daddy didnt think the new nose was
different enough so Im in for more
alterations I keep telling him it
looks just like his and he keeps
saying Thats why I want you to
change it Im terrified to find
out what it all means

They both laugh

The two women part and go their separate ways We follow
Louise as she opens the door to Roses room which bears a
printed sign saying INTENSIVE CARE QUALIFIED PERSONNEL
ONLY

INT ROSES ROOM -- DAY

Louise enters the room in time to surprise Read in the act
of pulling back the sheet covering Rose

LOUISE
Didnt you see the sign on the door
Mr Read Youre supposed to register
with me before you come in here

READ
I saw it I guess I consider myself
qualified

Louise edges Read away from the bed and covers Rose up again
Her entire body is heavily bandaged and almost every inch
of exposed skin has an IV needle taped to it Louise begins
to moisten Roses eyelids and lips with various gels

LOUISE
What are you trying to do give her
pneumonia

READ
Im trying to ease my guilt feelings
by telling myself that Rose is getting
better

LOUISE
(softening)
I see Is it working

READ
Is she getting better

LOUISE
Youve been here often enough in the
past two months to know as much as I
do

READ
When do I get to see Dr Keloid

LOUISE
You never tell me in advance when
youre coming How can I make an
appointment for you

READ
I never know in advance when the
next wave of guilt will hit me I
want to see him right now

LOUISE
Hes in a meeting

READ
Tell him I forced you

LOUISE
(leaving the room)
All right But please no touching

until shes conscious

READ
OK Mom

Louise makes a face and leaves
INT KELOIDS OFFICE -- DAY

Read sits across from Keloids desk in Keloids office which
seems more like a successful PR executives office than a
doctors While they talk Keloid toys with Roses file not
really ever looking at it he is obviously very familiar

with its contents and also in a very distracted frame of
mind

KELOID
Well as youve seen Rose is still
in some kind of coma sort of half
real coma half normal deep sleep
Could be weeks before shes lucid

READ
You dont know for sure

KELOID
No Her body is still in a state of
total shock She cant possibly be
moved to a city hospital yet Her
grafts seem to be healing well Weve
been monitoring the internal grafts
electronically and there is definitely
new tissue growth happening in the
abdominal cavity Whether this growth
will mature into functioning
intestinal mucosa we wont know for
quite a while

READ
You mean if your grafts or whatever
they are dont work shell never
eat like a normal human being again
Shell have to be fed intravenously

KELOID
Thats right At the moment she has
only enough small intestine to digest
the most basic nutrient material

See -- the longer the small intestine
the more complex the food that can

be broken down and absorbed by the
body as food Cows have lots and

lots of intestines so they can eat
grass and other vegetable matter We
have medium-length intestines so we
can eat meat and a limited variety

of vegetable matter Vampire bats --
the real ones I mean -- have short
intestines so they eat whole blood
which is very easy to break down and
assimilate Your girlfriends in the
same boat

READ
What about her brain
KELOID
Her helmet probably saved her from
brain damage but until shes fully
conscious

READ
You wont know that either

KELOID

(throwing up his hands)
Hart what can I tell you Theres
no magic Look Ive done my best
Youre welcome to come here and keep
your vigil by Roses bedside any
time the mood takes you but please
believe me I will personally
telephone you the instant Rose shows
even the slightest signs of regaining
consciousness

Read sighs then shrugs with his good shoulder
EXT CLINIC DRIVEWAY -- DAY

Lloyd Walsh and Read stand in the driveway watching as two
orderlies load the burned and smashed hulk of Reads Norton
into the back of Murray Cyphers Ford station wagon

WALSH
Jeez when I saw that thing burning
I never figured Id be standing here
talking to you a month later Hows
your hand

READ
Theyre taking the cage off this
afternoon Thats when Ill find
out The pin stays in my shoulder
for another month though Doesnt
seem to bother me except when it
gets damp

Cypher comes hurriedly out of the front door putting on a

suit jacket and stuffing papers into his attachÂ® case at the
same time He walks over to Read and Walsh and opens the
door of his car

CYPHER
(to Walsh)
Hi Lloyd How ya doin

WALSH
Great

Cypher gets into his car slams the door and pops the
passenger door open for Read

CYPHER
Cmon Hart I got a pack of hungry
investors waiting for me

Read gets into the station wagon as the orderlies slam the
rear door shut on the Norton Walsh waves goodbye to Read
who smiles weakly

CYPHER
I hope youve got some friends wholl
help you unload that pile of junk
Ive got a bad back Whatre you
going to do with it Use it for an
ashtray

He turns the ignition key and starts the station wagon
READ

Giving it to a friend for parts I

can hardly stand to look at it Think

Ill get back into go-karts
Cypher laughs waves to Walsh and pulls away from the
driveway Walsh smiles at them and turns back to the clinic
patting himself absently under the chin as he goes

EXT CLINIC -- DAY

INT CLINIC HALLNIGHT NURSES STATION -- NIGHT
he night nurse checks her watch at her station which is

f a hall Its time for her to make her rounds She puts
own her magazine -- People -- and walks down the hall At
he end of it she disappears down a stairwell

taodrH

INT ANOTHER HALL -- NIGHT

The night nurse walks past Roses room pausing only for a
moment to glance in at Roses sleeping form She then
continues on down the hall

INT ANOTHER HALL -- NIGHT

The night nurse walks past Lloyd Walshs door There is a
PLEASE DO NOT DISTURB sign hanging from his doorknob The
nurse notices that Walshs light is on and diffusing out
through the crack under the door but she continues on down
the hall

INT WALSHS ROOM -- NIGHT

Walsh is lying in bed reading The Life and Work of Sigmund
Freud which he has borrowed from Judy Glasberg His room
like all the private rooms at the clinic is furnished in

the style of the plushest most modern jet-set ski lodges
Its easy to understand why patients extend their stays beyond
what is medically necessary and just as obvious that the
Keloid Clinic management makes no attempt to discourage this
home away from home attitude toward the place

Walsh cant get comfortable with the book which he has just
started to read He checks his watch Its 113 am Hes a
little nervous about his operation tomorrow morning He puts
down his book gets out of bed puts on his bathrobe slips
into his slippers and leaves his room to go for a stroll
through the deserted clinic

INT CLINIC HALLWAY -- NIGHT

Hands in pockets Walsh strolls through the clinic past the
lounge the ping-pong table the breakfast nook

INT ANOTHER HALLWAY -- NIGHT

Walsh rounds a corner that leads him past Roses door which
still bears its INTENSIVE CARE sign As he passes by her
door he hears a muffled scream followed by a series of moans
and indistinct angry shouts Walsh opens her door without

hesitation
INT ROSES ROOM -- NIGHT

By the light of the full moon and the hallway Walsh can see
Rose thrashing around violently in her bed getting twisted
up in her sheets and ripping out her IV needles As he
watches one of her IV bottles pulled off its stand by its
feed tube falls to the floor and smashes to pieces spilling
blood plasma everywhere

Walsh now sees that the floor is littered with shredded bits
and pieces of surgical gauze and bandages which Rose has
torn from her various wounds and grafts The plasma begins
to soak into the debris surrounding the bed Her torso is
still covered only by bandages making her look like a mummy
jerking to life in the half-light of her tomb

Walsh rushes over to the bed and quickly lowers the safety
railing He then tries to hold Rose down by the shoulders to
keep her from pulling out the last of her IV tubes When he
grabs her by the wrists he notices that she is oozing blood
from where the IV needles have been pulled out

WALSH
Rosie Rosie sweetie take it easy
You need that juice sweetie Its
keeping you alive Hey easy there
Easy Thats it Thats a girl

Under the pressure of Walshs body Rose begins to calm down
Her eyes which have been open but staring and unseeing now
begin to fill with consciousness

ROSE
Hart What are you what are you
doing Hart Are we all right Are
we

WALSH

Im not Hart Rosie Harts back in
Montreal waiting for you Im Lloyd
Im a friend of yours

ROSE
Hart

WALSH
Back in Montreal Waiting for you
Hes fine Hes OK I was just talking
to him this afternoon

ROSE
Oh I I guess I was dreaming

Walsh lets go of Roses wrists

WALSH
I dont think you were just dreaming
You and Hart were in a really
spectacular motorcycle crash

ROSE
A crash Was there fire Was there
blood

WALSH
Yeah Plenty of both Youre bleeding
right now

(getting up)
Id better get Dr Keloid

Rose grabs Walsh by the arm and pulls him back down on the
bed

ROSE
No Not yet Im all right But Im
freezing cold and youre so warm
Hold me

WALSH
Look I think Id better

ROSE
Please hold me Im dying of the
cold

Rose puts her arms around Walsh who hesitates for a moment
then puts his arms around her and hugs her for a moment

ROSE
Oh God that feels so good

Behind Walshs back Rose pulls the last remaining IV needle
out of her left wrist

WALSH
(a bit nervous)
Ah look you dont even know where
you are do you

Rose pulls Walshs face down to hers then slips her arms
under his and locks her hands behind his back

ROSE
Sure I do Im here with you

WALSH
Look this is really weird Are you
sure you know what youre Ow

Feeling a sudden sharp pain Walsh tries to pull away Rose
wont let him get up

WALSH
Hey I think I I think I cut myself
or something You got something sharp
in there with you Ow Oh that hurts

He makes a huge effort to lift himself off the bed but Rose
hangs on to him and comes up with him Blood is soaking
through Walshs bathrobe around the right armpit like dark
red sweat

He is moaning and sobbing as he strains to get away

Finally Walsh collapses on top of Rose quivering and
whimpering Rose sighs deeply and begins to stroke his head
affectionately

INT MISS OWENS ROOM AT THE CLINIC -- EARLY MORNING

Miss Beatrice Owen a tough-looking maiden lady in her
fifties sits on the edge of her bed pulling on a pair of
white gloves She is wearing an immaculate morning outfit
which looks vaguely 40s and probably is One of her hands
has been twisted by arthritis and puts up quite a struggle
before allowing itself to be encased in its glove She then
begins to use her teeth to pull on the other glove

The second glove is only half-way on when Miss Owen hears a
desperate scratching and bumping at her door She stops what
shes doing

MISS OWEN
Yes
(pause)
Who is it

After a pause comes more scratching followed by the sound
of a hand feebly slapping on the door With her second glove
still only half on Miss Owen gets up goes to the door and
opens it

The instant the door is opened a ghastly pale Lloyd Walsh
slumps heavily across Miss Owens shoulders The force drives
her back several steps and she screams with fear

MISS OWEN
Oh God save us

WALSH
Im sick Im sick Help me

When she realizes shes not being attacked Miss Owen steps
back from Walsh but unsupported he starts to fall to the
floor Miss Owen slips her hands up under his arms and guides
him unsteadily to the bed

MISS OWEN
Mr Walsh What on earth has happened
to you

Miss Owen sits Walsh on the bed where he crumples into an
awkward lying position When she withdraws her hands from
under his arms Miss Owen finds that her right glove is
soaking through with very watery blood

WALSH
I dont know I cant remember a
thing
INT EXAMINATION ROOM -- MORNING

Keloid and Louise examine Walsh who lies half-naked on his
left side his right arm stretched out over his head to expose
a deep round and still-bleeding puncture in his right
armpit

Like everything else at the clinic the examination room has
been designed and furnished with luxury and style in mind as
much as pure function Even the cantilevered examination
light which Keloid is playing on Walshs wound is color-
coordinated with the drapes the chairs the coat-rack and
the enamel finish of the examination table itself
KELOID
Were you sleepwalking Could you
have fallen against something outside
and then come back in without waking
up

WALSH

(voice still shaky)
I doubt it Never done anything like
that before

KELOID

(to Louise)
Get me some stuffing maybe a sponge
or two as well This wound isnt
clotting at all I think were going
to have to shoot in some coagulants
to get a scab to form

LOUISE
Right away

She leaves closing the door behind her Keloid takes a closer
look at the wound through a large illuminated magnifying
glass

KELOID
From what I can see its a very
very clean and precise wound You
havent leaned on any picket fences
have you Kind with those little
spearheads

WALSH
(unable to respond to
Keloids attempt at
humor)

No

Keloid grunts takes out a tongue depressor and begins to
probe Walshs wound with it

KELOID
Does this hurt

WALSH
Cant feel a thing

KELOID
(surprised)
You cant

WALSH
My whole right side has no feeling
in it Just this aching kind of
tingling

KELOID
Hm

Louise comes in carrying wads of surgical gauze sponges
etc She puts them down and takes Keloid aside

LOUISE
Dr Keloid Kenny Kwong would like to
see you

KELOID

Right now

LOUISE
He says its very important Hes
waiting in the hall

KELOID

(confidentially)
OK Listen our friend here may
have had a stroke I think the
Generals the best place for him
But before you plug him up I want 10
cc of blood drawn directly from that
wound for tests Then get Steve to
drive him into the city in the
ambulance Tell him to take lots of
plasma with him Were going to have
to forget about the coagulants until
the General has a chance to do an
ECG on him

LOUISE
Will do Doctor

Keloid leaves
INT HALLWAY -- DAY

Keloid steps out into the hall and joins Kenny Kwong the
clinics senior orderly a concerned-looking graying Chinese
man of about fifty-five

KWONG
Can you come with me please Dr
Keloid

KELOID
Sure Kenny Whats up

They begin to walk briskly down the hall Kenny leading

KWONG
You told me to check around the
grounds to see if I could find out
how Mr Walsh got hurt

Keloid nods

KWONG
I couldnt find nothing outside No
blood nothing Then Nurse Rita call
me She find something She tell me
go get Dr Keloid You see it then
you tell us what happened

They round the corner taking them into the hallway that goes
past Roses room Kenny walks up to Roses door and knocks
sharply

KWONG
Nurse Rita waiting for you in here

After a short pause Rita opens the door and ushers them
inside closing the door behind them

INT ROSES ROOM -- DAY

Once inside the door Keloid is shocked at the state of Roses
room It is basically as we last saw it except that Rita

has reattached Rose who seems to be in a coma once again

to her IV bottles

The area of the wall next to the doorhandle side of the door
is smeared with bloody handprints -- Walsh apparently used
the doorknob to pull himself to his feet then supported
himself by holding on to the wall and door moulding

Rita leads Keloid over to the bed while Kwong hangs back to
watch that nobody enters inadvertently
RITA
Watch your feet Doctor The police
will probably want every little piece
of glass and strip of gauze exactly
the way we found it

Keloid finds a place to stand next to the bed checks Roses
eyes then her pulse

KELOID
Why do you think the police would be
interested in this Rita

RITA
Why its perfectly obvious that
that Walsh fellow attempted to molest
the poor girl while she was still in
a coma Ive seen things like that
happen before Maybe he was drunk

KELOID

(drawing back the

sheet)
Hm Her grafts have taken amazing
well Probably wont even have to
rebandage Hm I cant even see any
scar tissue

He lifts Roses left arm and presses around her armpit

KELOID
Wow Ill have to have a closer look
at that

RITA

Rejection problems
Keloid lowers her arm and covers her with the sheet again

KELOID

(standing up)
Dont think so Seems to be an extreme
swelling of the lymph nodes under
the arm Could just be a local
infection thats under attack but
its quite a bump And theres some
kind of lesion there Doesnt seen
to be gangrenous but
He walks thoughtfully toward the door Kwong stands waiting

KWONG
Want me to clean up the mess now
Doctor

KELOID

(snapping out of his

train of thought)
What Oh yes But save all the pieces
and scrape some of the dried blood
on to a slide Maybe well find
something out

RITA
But Dr Keloid Mr Walsh he may
well be

KELOID

(turning to Rita)
Rita Lloyd Walsh wouldnt do
something like that He just wouldnt
And none of this explains how he got
his wound I think a quiet thorough
and very private investigation is in
order Dont you

Rita lowers her eyes
EXT CLINIC DRIVEWAY -- NIGHT

Wide-angle shot of the clinic in the dead of night The moon
is full

INT ROSES ROOM -- NIGHT

In the darkness of her room Roses eyes are open and staring
She begins to pull the IV needles out of her wrists and
ankles

INT WHIRLPOOL ROOM -- NIGHT

In the whirlpool room which contains three full-size
whirlpool baths a bar and a lounge Judy Glasberg is taking
a midnight whirlpool bath to calm herself down The room is
deserted except for Judy but she seems to have no trouble
adjusting the controls of the bath to get it just right
As Judy plays with the temperature controls the door behind
her opens and someone enters closing the door behind her
Judy looks up startled Rose stands at the door in her fresh
clinic gown For some reason Judy suddenly feels vulnerable
in her skimpy bikini

JUDY
Rose Is that you I thought everyone
was asleep They told me you were
still in a coma

ROSE

(approaching the edge

of the bath)
Oh no Im doing much better now
thank you

She seems to be completely normal and as childlike as ever
save for the hollows under her eyes Judy positions her body
so that her nakedness is hidden by the swirling bubbles of
the whirlpool

JUDY
It its really weird to meet you
this way I mean Ive never really
talked to you before But I sort of
feel I know you youve been around
here for so long And I saw them
bring you in right after the accident

ROSE
Do you mind if I get in with you
Ive been lying in bed for such a
long time my body aches all over

JUDY
Ah well I does anybody know
youre here I mean does Dr Keloid
know you youve regained
consciousness

Rose climbs into the bath with Judy gown and all

ROSE
I dont think so Everybody seemed
to be asleep It was a bit spooky
waking up and finding myself all
alone Im so glad I ran into you
(with surprise)
Hey know what I think I can feel
the warmth of your body radiating
out to me through the water Ive
never felt anything like that before

Judy starts to grope for her towel by the side of the pool

JUDY
I think Id better get out now Im
getting all wrinkly

Rose floats over to Judy and takes her by the arm interfering
with Judys attempt to get her towel

ROSE
Oh no Not yet You havent even
told me your name

JUDY
Judy Glasberg Nice to meet you

Rose slips her arms up under Judys arms and hugs her tightly

ROSE
Mm Its nice to meet you too

Judy tries to gently disengage herself from Roses embrace

JUDY
Oh now cmon Youre embarrassing
me Let me put some clothes on and
well have a few drinks or something
OK

When she realizes that Rose isnt going to let her go Judy
starts to struggle more seriously

JUDY
Let me go please I want to get
dressed Listen to tell you the
truth I think theres still something
wrong with you I think you ought to
let Ow Oh Somethings cutting
me Oh It hurts

She starts to thrash about madly in the water still locked
in Roses embrace They dip under the water then come up
again Judy gasping for air Rose lets her move wherever she
wants but keeps her arms locked about Judy her hands now
digging into Judys shoulders from behind

In tight close-up we see something joining the two bodies
under the arms from Roses left to Judys right Even closer
we see something fleshy slipping in and out of some kind of
sheath barbs cutting through flesh blood beginning to draw
along a fleshy translucent tube From small glands at the
base of the tube dark green fluid almost black begins to
flow into the blood drawn up the tube The mixture of blood
and green fluid pumps back and forth in the tube

Judy is now moaning in spasms her head arched back as far
away from Rose as possible her hair floating in the water
behind her and forming spirals in the whirlpool

Rose holds on to Judy for dear life her eyes closed in
ecstasy her cheeks unnaturally flushed She doesnt notice
that Judys head is beginning to slip beneath the surface of
the water Judys body is wracked by one final spasm then

she relaxes completely her head going under completely The
last bubbles of air from her lungs mix with the bubbles spewed
out by the whirlpool oxygenator After a few moments Rose
releases Judy We see a close-up of the translucent fleshy
tube now empty of blood sliding back into its sheath

It is only after she has backed away and taken several soul-
deep breaths that Rose notices Judys face is two inches
below the surface of the water the tip of her nose almost
breaking through to the air but not quite Rose frantically
grabs Judy by the hair and pulls her out of the water Judy
isnt breathing

Rose manages to drag Judy to the edge of the pool clambers
out on to the side then pulls Judy out on to the pool siding
with her Judy trailing a thin trickle of blood in the water
behind her

Rose holds Judys mouth open and tries to revive her using
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation but its no good Judy is dead
Rose shakes her head and starts to cry

ROSE
Oh no No

Rose shakes Judys corpse hysterically then collapses across
it sobbing After a moment she gets up visibly fighting
for control She sets her jaw and begins to drag Judys body
out of the whirlpool room
INT READS GARAGE IN MONTREAL -- NIGHT

In the ramshackle garage behind the small house he has rented
in Montreal Hart Read has finally gotten around to trying

to put his demolished Norton back together again The engine
has been removed from its frame and sits before him on a
metal-topped work table and Read is in the process of
completely dismantling it Small cardboard cartons of various
sizes sit on the table waiting to receive individual pieces
of the engine

The radio hung above the table is tuned to an FM rock station
which is on full blast even though it is about 1 am

INT READS KITCHEN -- NIGHT

In Reads kitchen the telephone is ringing but Read has no
chance of hearing it Next to the phone pinned to a cork
message board with colored plastic drafting pins are several
photos of Read and Rose enjoying happier times

INT CLINIC LOUNGE -- NIGHT

Rose listens to the phone ring at Reads from the telephone
in the deserted main lounge Her hair is wet and matted and
she is shivering uncontrollably She lets it ring huddling
in her chair

INT OBSERVATION WARD AT GENERAL -- NIGHT

Lloyd Walsh is in the process of pulling on his pants in the
observation ward of the General which he shares with a
thirtyish traffic-accident victim Walshs Lufthansa flight
bag is already packed and ready to go sitting on his bed in
the shadow of an IV blood plasma bottle

VICTIM
Hey you cant leave yet Lloyd
They havent figured out how come
youre bleeding all over the place

WALSH
Aw its slowed down to a trickle

No problem

VICTIM
Hows your arm

WALSH

He picks up his bag and opens the door without hesitation
VICTIM
If the night nurse comes around

He leaves closing the door behind him

INT CORRIDOR AT GENERAL -- NIGHT

Walsh walks briskly down a corridor which leads to the main
entrance of the Montreal General Hospital flight bag in
hand Nobody stops him

EXT GENERAL ENTRANCE -- NIGHT

Walsh leaves the General and walks around the circular
driveway to the street where he is just in time to pick up
a cab being paid off by a night orderly arriving for work

Walsh gets in the cab and it pulls away from the curb

INT CAB -- NIGHT

Walsh leans his head back against the back seat as the cab
pulls away He rolls his head from side to side as though
trying to shake off a headache

EXT MONTREAL STREETS -- NIGHT

The cab moves through the streets of Montreal and enters a
ramp leading eventually to the Decarie Expressway The cab
accelerates to the speed limit

INT CAB -- NIGHT

The nasal wailing voice of a popular singer blares from all
four speakers in the cab Walsh is now sitting quite still
in the back seat head resting against the seat back

CAB DRIVER
Hey Mister you wanna sleep I can
turn the radio off Its a long way
to Camelford

Walsh doesnt answer The driver looks in his rear-view
mirror Walsh is slumped in the shadows of the back-seat
area

CAB DRIVER
Hey Mister You want me to turn the
radio off Or maybe if you want I
can turn off the back speakers and
just leave on the front ones

He turns around in his seat to look at Walsh His words die
on his lips Walsh is staring at him with eyes that have
completely clouded over so that the whites of his eyes are
indistinguishable from the irises and pupils Dark green
foam is drooling from the corners of Walshs mouth

The cab driver doesnt have a chance to react any further
before Walsh attacks him viciously grabbing him by the
shoulders and biting the cab driver on the cheek

EXT EXPRESSWAY -- NIGHT

The cab carrying Walsh veers crazily across three lanes of
the nearly deserted expressway

INT CAB -- NIGHT

The cab driver tries madly to pull himself around in his
seat so that he can see where hes going screaming in pain
all the while With one tremendous jerk he frees his face
from Walshs locked jaws

EXT EXPRESSWAY -- NIGHT

The cab finally slews completely out of control smashes

into the low concrete railing lining the expressway
cartwheels over the railing and falls on to the expressway
ramp some twenty feet below where it is rammed by an immense
diesel truck delivering furniture to a sub-urban warehouse

The cab is pushed fifty yards along the rampway shedding
pieces of bodywork and glass all the way before the truck
manages to stop

INT THE KELOIDS BEDROOM AT THE CLINIC -- NIGHT

The telephone on the night table beside the Keloids double
bed starts to ring Dan Keloid rolls over fumbles for the
receiver and finally gets it off the hook and up to his
ear Roxanne stirs beside him in bed

KELOID
Yeah Yeah No No youre kidding
Dead Yeah No I would have
absolutely no objections to an
autopsy Its definitely indicated
No Ive got nothing to add to my
telephoned report We never came up
with anything else Yeah Right OK
Bye

He hangs up the phone in a state of drowsy excitement Roxanne
rolls over and puts her arm around him Keloid picks up his
wrist-watch to check the time Its 307 a m

ROXANNE
What is it Dan

KELOID
Lloyd Walsh is dead

Roxanne starts to snap out of her sleep

ROXANNE

KELOID
He left the General about an hour
ago Told another patient he felt

crashed on a highway Both occupants
dead

ROXANNE
Oh God Poor Lloyd But you said

cab driver drinking

KELOID
No its Walsh Theyre not happy
with his corpse

(baffled)
Something about the eyes Im going
to have to go over Walshs file again
It just doesnt add up
EXT COUNTRY ROAD -- NIGHT (APPROX 4 AM)

By the light of a full moon Rose walks purposefully down a
dirt country road a borrowed windbreaker pulled tightly
around her over her clinic gown and hospital slippers starting
to come apart on her feet She is determined to get as far
away from the clinic as she can by morning light

DISSOLVE TO
EXT COUNTRY ROAD -- NIGHT (APPROX 4 AM)

Rose finds herself walking beside a moonlit field with a
ramshackle barn at one end She pauses beside the barn for a
moment then slips under the fence surrounding the field and
makes her way gingerly across the muddy barnyard toward the
door of the barn The house nearest the barn is dark Rose
gently edges open the door of the barn

INT BARN -- NIGHT

Once inside the barn Rose feels around for a light switch
She finds it without much trouble and flicks it on The barn
is low and full of cobwebs and houses only two solemn cows
and a scraggly chicken

Rose heads for the nest of straw that the two cows have made
and gradually snuggles her way in between them

She starts to stroke the side of one of the cows getting

the animal accustomed to her touch at the same time carefully
slipping out of her windbreaker She then raises her left

arm and presses her left armpit flat against the cows side
After a pause she gives a short sharp push with her left
side as though shes pushing something into the cow with

her body The cow responds by lifting up its head and turning
to look at her Satisfied that nothing too threatening is
happening it turns back and lowers its head again

Rose stretches out over the cow in ecstasy Her eyes are
closed Blood begins to flow in a rapid one-way stream from
the cow into Rose

She is breathing rapidly and heavily Suddenly she pulls
away from the cow giving us a chance to see a flash of some
kind of elongated tube-like organ retracting under her left
arm dripping blood from its tip As Rose lurches to her
feet we can see a small deep wound leaking blood and green
bile-like fluid in the cows side where Roses armpit had
been pressed The cows stir in reaction to Roses violent
movement

She staggers away from the cows dizzy and nauseous She
manages to reach the stalls which she leans on for support
before she begins to vomit

Suddenly the door bangs open and a drunken old farmer
stumbles into the barn a whisky bottle in his hand

FARMER
All right you Hold it right there
(spotting Rose)
Oh Whatta we got here Hello sweet
honey pie Whatre ya drinkin You
come in to get outta the cold

He waves the bottle at Rose as he approaches her then puts
his arm around her so that the bottle rests on her chest

FARMER
I got something ya can take a drink
off of anit aint no whisky
neither

He laughs coarsely and kisses Rose on the neck When she
fails to resist him he drops his nearly empty whisky bottle
and starts to nuzzle her collarbone Rose wearily slips her
hand up behind the farmers head and pulls it down toward
her left armpit

FARMER

(surprised)
Hey thats real nice honey pie
You like me dont ya I kin tell ya
do

The farmer is slobbering happily around Roses shoulder when
she suddenly grabs his head by the hair with both her hands
and pulls him viciously down on the cutting points of her
bloodsucking organ

he farmer screams in agony Rose holds the farmers head
own until he stops screaming and starts breathing heavily
spasmodically Then she lets him go

QH

The farmer straightens up He is holding his hand over his
right eye Rose is terrified at what shes done With a
horrified sob she backs away then turns and runs stumbling
out the door leaving the farmer to stand swaying in a semi-
anesthetized stupor in the middle of the barn

INT READS KITCHEN -- NIGHT (514 AM)

Read has fallen asleep at his kitchen table while working on
the engine of his Norton The partially dismantled engine
sits on a section of newspaper on the kitchen table next to

a half-empty cup of coffee and an open grease-smeared Norton
Owners Manual

He is awakened out of his deep sleep by the sound of the
kitchen phone ringing Read jumps up still half asleep
almost knocking over his chair in the process It takes him
a second or two to realize that he is in fact at home

Read grabs for the phone somehow terrified that the person
on the other end will hang up before he answers

READ
Hello

(suddenly very excited)
Rose Is it really you How come

youre I mean the last time I
saw you Oh God Rose are you
all right

INT CLINIC LOUNGE -- NIGHT

In the main lounge of the clinic Rose kneels beside the
table on which the lounge phone rests cradling the receiver
in her hands She is covered with blood her gown has been
ripped and she is close to hysteria Her feet are covered
with dirt and shes tracked mud inside marking her trail
from the clinics back door clearly

ROSE

(sobbing)

She suddenly becomes aware of someone elses presence in the
lounge She turns with a start Rita who is acting as night
nurse is standing right behind her a shocked and unbelieving
look on her face

INT READS KITCHEN -- NIGHT

READ

READ
Rose tell me whats wrong Please

ROSE (VO)

Read is suddenly left holding a receiver humming a dial tone
He waits only a second or two before he starts to look
frantically for the phone number of the Keloid Clinic in the
small book hanging from a nail by the phone

READ

(thumbing through the

book)
Christ What was the number of that
place

INT KELOIDS OFFICE -- NIGHT (530 AM)
Keloid is sitting at his desk in his bath-robe and slippers
looking into a microscope holding a dry slide of Walshs
blood There is a knock at his door Keloid looks up as Rita
enters closing the door behind her

KELOID
Hi Rita I couldnt sleep Ive
been trying to figure out what there
could possibly be in Walshs blood
that would cause

RITA

(interrupting with

quiet urgency)
Doctor I think youd better come
with me

INT CYPHERS LIVING ROOM IN DORVAL -- NIGHT

A groggy Murray Cypher sits on a sofa in front of the TV set
in his living room trying to get his four-month-old son to
drink his 6 am bottle The images of the early morning
show -- the sound has been turned off -- seem to attract the
baby more than the bottle does

To Cyphers complete surprise the telephone starts to ring

CYPHER
Oh no I just dont believe it OK
Jeffrey -- youre on your own for a

second

Cypher tries to prop the kid up between two cushions but he
starts to cry the instant Cypher lets go of him Cypher picks
him up and takes him over to the phone which is on a shelf
at the other end of the room

CYPHER

Cypher is having trouble juggling the phone the bottle and
his baby who is gumming the receiver and drooling into the

Read hangs up the phone He takes a close look at one of the
pictures of himself and Rose on the Norton

INT ROSES ROOM AT THE CLINIC -- NIGHT

Rose sits quietly on the edge of her bed her feet dangling
over the side not quite touching the floor She keeps her
head down and does not look at Keloid who is conferring
with Rita at the door Rita has given Rose a new gown and
cleaned her up a bit for Keloid

Rita leaves and Keloid closes the door behind her He turns
to Rose and approaches the bed tapping his stethoscope
against the palm of one hand He doesnt say anything until
he sits down on the bed beside her

KELOID
Rose Im Dr Keloid Dan Keloid
Im here to help you sweetheart
Rose lifts her head to look at Keloid for the first time
Tears are streaming down her cheeks She throws her arms
around Keloid and begins to sob on his shoulder Keloid hugs
her gently and pets her on the head as though she were a
child

After one or two moments Keloid detaches himself from Rose
and lies her back down on her bed

KELOID
Rose we wont talk about anything
right now except how youre feeling
OK

Rose nods still snuffling slightly

KELOID
Good First thing I want to do is to
check out some of the skin grafts we
did for you Now could you please
just slip your arm out of your left
shoulder strap and raise your arm
over your head

Instead of doing as Keloid asks Rose puts her hands over
her face and shakes her head Keloid is baffled

KELOID
Whats the matter Rose Are you in
pain Talk to me Rose Its the
only way I can understand whats
bothering you

ROSE

(from behind her hands)
Im hideous Doctor Im crazy and
Im a monster

KELOID
Cmon Rose Theres just about
nothing we cant fix if we know whats
wrong Now I dont want any more
games Do what I tell you

Rose reluctantly takes her hands away from her face and slips
her left arm out of its shoulder strap A pause and then
she raises her left arm above her head on the pillow
Keloid can barely suppress his surprise at what he sees
Nestled in Roses left armpit is a fleshy tubular lump with
an opening at the upper end of it Keloid reaches over and
presses it gently with his fingertips

KELOID
Does that hurt

ROSE
No It doesnt hurt

Keloid takes a closer look at the fleshy pouch The opening

at the upper end seems to be surrounded by sphincter muscles
Keloid gently spreads the opening with his thumb Deep within
the pouch something an angry pink color something
glistening seems to be pulsating When he removes his thumb
the muscles pull the opening closed again the way a drawstring
closes a bag

Keloid sits up on the side of the bed again trying to regain
his composure

KELOID

(after a pause)
As far as I can tell now itll take
just a very minor operation to remove
that growth from under your arm It
may be some kind of external
intestinal tissue The neutral field
tissue graft we did has been trying
to find a way to get food that you
can digest into your body I was
hoping it would do that by providing
you with a regular set of small
intestines but it seems to have had
something different in mind

Rose shakes her head A baffled expression comes over Keloids
face

KELOID
How long have you been conscious
Rose Do you know

ROSE
Couple of days

KELOID
Do you feel weak
ROSE
I feel strong I feel very strong

KELOID
Rita tells me you refused to let her
attach you to your intravenous
nutrient bottles Why

ROSE
I dont need them They make me feel
sick

KELOID

I dont understand Theyve got to
be your only source of food

ROSE
Theyre not They havent been for a
couple of days Not since that man

KELOID
Man What are you talking about

ROSE
Ill show you

Rose puts her right hand behind Keloids head and draws it
slowly down toward her left armpit When Keloids head is
about a foot and a half away from the organ Rose grabs Keloid
by the hair with both hands and strains upwards with her

body

Keloid emits a low gurgling scream which soon cuts off with
the suddenness of a thrown switch Exhausted of energy Keloid
collapses across Rose who begins to rock him gently from

side to side as she pumps the blood from his body

EXT KENTUCKY FRIED CHICKEN DEPOT -- MORNING (645 AM)

A battered old Ford pick-up truck pulls into the parking lot
of a Colonel Sanders Kentucky Fried Chicken depot beside the
two-lane highway leading to the Keloid Clinic The door of
the truck opens and a vaguely familiar mangy dog jumps out
it belongs to the farmer who was Roses third victim

INT FRIED CHICKEN DEPOT -- MORNING

The farmer enters the take-out depot which is deserted except
for staff and one lone trucker The farmer is wearing a pair
of crooked and cracked sunglasses He is not very steady on
his feet His dog watches with concern through the glass
door

FARMER

(to counter girl)
One bucket of your best for me and
my dog there

COUNTER GIRL
Yes sir

The counter girl conveys the order through the window into
the kitchen then turns back to write up the farmers bill

COUNTER GIRL
Yes and will that be Oh

The girls words trail off as she notices a tear of blood
running down the farmers cheek from under the right lens of
his sunglasses

COUNTER GIRL
Hey Mister Did you know youre
bleeding

The farmer dabs at his cheek with a tobacco-stained finger
smearing the blood

FARMER
Its nothinâ€™

TRUCKER
Musta had a rough night Buddy

FARMER
Think I got in a fight or somethin
Cant remember too good

The man in the kitchen slaps a bucket of chicken down on the
kitchen-window counter

KITCHEN MAN
One bucket ready to go

The counter girl picks up the bucket and carries it over to
the trucker She has just barely put it down when the farmer
grabs it and starts tearing the lid from it
TRUCKER
Hey Buddy I think that ones mine

The farmer grabs a piece of fried chicken from the bucket
and starts wolfing it down The trucker puts his hand on the
farmers shoulder and turns him around so that they face
each other a piece of chicken skin hanging from the farmers
lips

TRUCKER
I said I think that ones mine
Buddy

The farmer starts shaking uncontrollably

FARMER
I gotta eat I gotta eat I gotta
eat

TRUCKER

Take those glasses off so I can see
who Im talkin to

The trucker reaches out and takes off the farmers sunglasses
To his disgust he is confronted with one closed swollen

and bleeding eye and one eye which has almost completely
clouded over from white of eye to pupil

TRUCKER
What the hell

Bits of chicken drool from the farmers mouth followed by a
froth of dark green foam Without warning the farmer lunges
at the trucker and tries to bite his face The trucker dodges
out of the way catches the farmer by his jacket and swings

him over the counter where he crashes into the counter girl

As the kitchen man comes out of the kitchen with a pot of
boiling oil in his hand the farmer grabs the girl and manages
to bite her on the arm before she can pull away Green foam
dribbles into the girls wound

Once the girl has pulled loose and backs away screaming
hysterically the kitchen man throws the potful of oil on
the farmer as he struggles to his feet The farmer screams

As the dog barks madly at the door the trucker and the
kitchen man jump on the farmer and pound him senseless behind

the counter
INT SURGICAL WASH-UP AT THE KELOID CLINIC -- MORNING

Keloid and Roxanne are preparing to perform an early morning
facelift They wash their hands and forearms and put on
surgical gloves as the scrub-nurse prepares their masks and
gowns Keloid has a thick band-aid on his neck

ROXANNE
Youre sure you want to do this one
Dan Louise and I could handle it
with no trouble

KELOID
Ill be fine

ROXANNE

You were pretty groggy this morning
(noticing band-aid)

Cut yourself shaving

KELOID
Ill be fine

Keloid turns away from Roxanne to avoid further discussion
The orderly begins to help him on with his surgical gown
Keloid allows a pained confused expression to take over his
face for a moment then suppresses it

EXT SIX-LANE HIGHWAY -- MORNING

On a six-lane highway leading out of Montreal Cyphers
station wagon starts out on its journey to the Keloid Clinic

INT STATION WAGON -- MORNING

Inside Cypher and Read sit bleary-eyed both drinking coffee
from styrofoam cups with slits in their covers and listening
to the car radio in silence The 8 am news is in progress

NEWSCASTER (VO)
but there can be little doubt
that the issue of police brutality
will still be with us for some time
to come And speaking of brutality --
an incident of violence that took
place over a Highway 11 fried chicken
take-out counter ended in the death
of one man and the wounding of an
eighteen-year-old girl Well give
you further details on that story as
they become available

Read and Cypher drive on to the sounds of a Radio Shack
commercial

INT CLINIC OPERATING ROOM -- MORNING

Keloid Roxanne Karl Louise and the scrub-nurse are in
the process of performing a routine facelift on a middle-
aged woman

Roxanne watches Keloid closely for signs of fatigue as he
makes the first cut under the womans chin with a scalpel
Keloids hand is rock steady He makes two more cuts and
rolls back a flap of skin Everything seems to be under
control

INT STATION WAGON -- MORNING

Cypher and Read drive on listening to the rest of the news
story

NEWSCASTER (VO)
The man later identified as forty-
three-year-old Fred Atkins of
Camelford went berserk this morning
during an argument over who was to
be served his bucket of chicken first
and bit the counter girl on the arm
The man was subdued by an unidentified
truck driver and the chicken places
cook but died of unknown causes
before police arrived Local health
authorities suspect that rabies might
be involved and have vaccinated
everyone concerned The dead mans
dog was destroyed on the spot And
now a brief pause for station
identification after which well
talk to a scientist who says that
earthquakes may one day become a
thing of the past

While they listen to a variation of the Radio Shack
commercial Cypher notices that theyre passing by the
Kentucky Fried Chicken depot There are still two police
cars parked in the parking lot

CYPHER
Hey were right there

READ
(drowsy)
Huh

CYPHER
The place they were talking about on
the radio
(joking)
Wanna stop off for some fried chicken

READ
(not reacting to the
joke)

Not hungry thanks

Cypher is about to say something further but realizes that
Read is too preoccupied with Rose to banter with He decides
to let it drop They drive off to the sounds of easy-listening
radio

INT CLINIC OPERATING ROOM -- MORNING

Keloid is now stitching up the flap of skin under his
patients chin Roxanne notices that his hand is no longer

as steady as it was earlier on in the operation He is having
trouble placing his stitches properly His mask is soaking
through at the mouth

ROXANNE
Do you want me to complete the
stitching Dr Keloid

KELOID
I need I need something to cut
with Dr Rushton

ROXANNE
You want the scissors now Doctor

KELOID
Yes The scissors now

Roxannes brow is furrowed as she reaches for the scissors
on her instrument tray and hands them to Keloid
ROXANNE
Scissors

Instead of simply allowing the scissors to be placed in his
hand Keloid grabs Roxanne by the wrist with one hand and

takes the scissors with the other He turns to look at her
She is shocked to see that his eyes have completely clouded
over Looking into them is like looking down two dark holes

ROXANNE
Dan

Without hesitation Keloid takes the scissors and cuts the
tip of Roxannes index finger off Roxanne stares down at

her bleeding finger an unvoiced scream rising in her throat
Keloid lets the scissors drop to the floor and pulls down

his mask Dark green fluid foams from his mouth He falls to
his knees and puts Roxannes index finger in his mouth
sucking on it like a straw Roxanne screams

Louise who turned to look at Keloid at the sound of the
falling scissors screams in unison backing away in terror
and disbelief The operating room explodes in confusion and
panic as Keloid and Roxanne start to thrash about knocking
instruments and various surgical appliances to the floor
The patient slumbers on oblivious

Dr Karl the anesthetist leaves his post behind the
patients head and tries to pull Keloid off Roxanne

KARL
Dan dont be stupid Whats the
matter with you Are you crazy or
something Stop it Stop it

Keloid lets go of Roxanne and sinks his teeth into Karls
shoulder Karl screams in pain but doesnt let go Louise
finally regains enough presence of mind to run out of the
operating room Roxanne writhes in pain and shock on the
floor

LOUISE
Im getting the police Im going to
call the police
INT PATIENTS LOUNGE -- MORNING

Rose is sitting in the patients lounge with one or two other
patients watching TV Next to Rose is a mobile intravenous
cart to whose three bottles she is attached by several IV
tubes A young nurse we have not seen previously sits beside
her obviously instructed to keep a close watch on Rose who
wears a clinic dressing-gown over her nightgown

Suddenly Louise comes flying past the lounge in hysterics
half crying half screaming

rummaging through the clothes hanging there

INT CYPHERS STATION WAGON -- LATE MORNING

EXT CLINIC DRIVEWAY -- LATE MORNING

Cyphers car pulls up the driveway with Read hanging half-
way out of the passenger door Read jumps out before the car
has come to a full stop

There are indeed three Quebec Provincial Police cruisers
parked at various strategic spots around the front of the
clinic There is also a paddy wagon parked right next to a
Quebec Bureau of Health van Cypher and Read walk up to the
front doors and enter the clinic

INT CLINIC -- LATE MORNING

Several police officers and a police photographer are moving
through the building with Dr Karl who is describing what
happened to the officer in charge Karl looks harried
confused and very unhappy

Read turns away from the main doors and walks through the
reception area looking anxiously for Rose There he encounters
two patients Miss Owen and a slightly younger woman sitting
in lawn chairs discussing the events of the morning

MISS OWEN

(to woman patient)

was bleeding and she was completely
hysterical Couldnt make out a word

EXT CLINIC -- LATE MORNING
Cypher and the head cop leave the clinic and walk out to the

parking lot As they pass the Bureau of Health van and the
Keloid Clinic ambulance Cypher sees a man in a medical
uniform giving a police officer an injection straight into

his stomach muscles in the ambulance The officers hand is
bandaged

COP

(to Cypher)

CYPHER
Bitten By what

They arrive at the back of the paddy wagon The cop points
to the mesh windows in the wagons rear doors

COP
By that

Cypher looks through the mesh Without warning Keloid throws
himself against the mesh from the inside frothing green at
the mouth smeared with blood and moaning like a creature
from hell He tries savagely to bite Cypher through the wire
which cuts his lips and scrapes the enamel from his teeth
Cypher jumps back

COP
Can you confirm the identification
of this man as Dr Daniel Keloid

CYPHER

(totally dismayed)
Oh my God My God

INT ENTRANCE OF CLINIC -- LATE MORNING

to the police photographer

The third cop nods Read follows the second cop down a
hallway

INT CLINIC BASEMENT -- LATE MORNING

Read follows the second cop down the stairs leading to the
clinics basement which still shows traces of the clinics
origins as an old farmhouse

The second cop walks over to a bank of three huge upright
freezers used to store the frozen food supplies for the
clinics staff and patients Read hangs back and glances
around the immense basement The cop walks over to the
farthest freezer and swings open the door

SECOND COP
Cmere Cant see anything from there

Read approaches slowly certain his worst fears are going to
be realized

SECOND COP
(gesturing toward the
interior of the
freezer)

Is that Rose

Read forces himself to look There frozen into a block of
ice that takes up the entire bottom of the freezer is the
hunched-over naked body of Judy Glasberg her eyes staring
her lashes frosted her mouth twisted horribly

Read exhales sharply almost sobbing with a combination of
horror and relief

READ
No No thats not Rose
EXT TWO-LANE HIGHWAY -- DAY

Rose is in the process of hitch-hiking her way into Montreal
She doesnt have to wait too long before an immense diesel
truck snorts and squeals to a stop on the gravel shoulder of
the road Rose is wearing Judy Glasbergs jeans boots
flannel shirt and jacket

As Rose runs toward the truck the passenger door swings
open for her

INT TRUCK CAB -- DAY

Rose sits in the passenger seat her bare feet up on the
dash tapping in time to the country-and-western music coming
from a tiny transistor radio hanging by a leather thong from
the rear-view mirror Rose is flushed and excited almost
delirious to find herself alive healthy and free

Beside her the trucker eats a steak on a bun with great
enthusiasm Hes in his forties graying at the temples
gentlemanly Hes just about to start in on the second half
of his sandwich when he pauses and glances over at Rose who
is happily watching the countryside rush by The trucker
holds out the second half of his sandwich to Rose taking
care to hold it in its tinfoil wrapper and not to touch it
with his fingers

TRUCKER
Want this Rose Steak on a bun
Real good

ROSE
Um wouldnt mind just one bite

She takes the sandwich carefully peels back the tinfoil
from one end and bites into it She chews and swallows

ROSE
Youre right Its fabulous

EXT TWO-LANE HIGHWAY -- DAY

The diesel truck pulls on to the dirt shoulder of the road
and comes to a halt The passenger door swings open and Rose
jumps down stumbling as she hits the ground She starts to
vomit before she even has a chance to get off her knees
The trucker comes around from the other side of the cab and
squats down beside her He puts his arms around her and holds
her while she finishes being sick

TRUCKER
Last time I ever patronize that greasy
spoon I can promise you that Cmon
sweetheart Theres a girl Get it
all out

Rose wipes her mouth with the sleeve of her shirt and tries
to stand up Shes still wobbly

TRUCKER
You just put your arms around me and
Ill lift you back in Well get you
some coffee or some soup or something
at the next stop OK

Rose nods weakly and puts her arms around the trucker As he
lifts her up she holds him close and closes her eyes A tear
runs down each cheek

DISSOLVE TO

EXT TWO-LANE HIGHWAY -- DAY

Rose walks along the side of the road hitch-hiking once
again After two cars pass her without stopping an American
sedan pulls off the road slightly ahead of her and then backs
up to meet her Rose gets in and the car pulls back on to

the highway She is flushed and invigorated

INT SEDAN -- DAY

Rose finds herself sitting next to a plump pleasant-looking
lady in her late thirties who smokes a cigarette furiously
as she drives

LADY
Hi Where are you going

ROSE
Montreal Where are you going

LADY
Same place
Rose settles back in her seat and allows herself a smile
Her cheeks are flushed and glowing

ROSE
Thats wonderful Thanks I was
beginning to think Id never get
back home again

EXT TWO-LANE HIGHWAY -- DAY

A Camelford police cruiser is on its way down the highway
going in the direction opposite to Rose

We follow the cruiser down the road a few hundred yards until
the diesel truck that stopped to pick up Rose comes into
view still stopped by the side of the road its passenger
door open

The cruiser pulls over and parks behind the truck One of

the OPP officers gets out and walks over to the cab of the
truck When he gets close to the cab the officer finds the
driver of the truck sitting sideways on the passenger seat
his legs out of the cab feet resting on the running board
The driver seems to be in some kind of daze and he is very
pale

OFFICER
Something wrong

TRUCKER
Huh Uh no nothing really wrong
I I guess I musta dozed off Yeah

Thats it I guess Pulled over to
have a nap

OFFICER
Well thats good We find too many

yourselves going all day and all
night Next time though try to
pick a better spot to pull over
This roads kind of narrow

TRUCKER
Oh yeah Right Will do Officer

OFFICER
OK Have a nice day
TRUCKER
Yeah Thanks

As the trucker turns to watch the cop leave we see blood
trickling from a wound at the back of his neck which the
trucker is obviously unaware of himself The officer walks
back to his car and waits until the truck pulls off the
shoulder and heads back down the road toward the city

EXT CAMELFORD STATION OFF TWO-LANE HIGHWAY -- DAY

The cruiser pulls into the parking lot of the local station
which is just off the two-lane highway between the clinic
and the spot where the diesel truck stopped by the side of
the road

In the parking lot mixed in with various police vehicles
are several familiar vehicles including Cyphers station
wagon and the clinic van

As the two officers get out of their car theyre met by a
Health Bureau official dressed in white who shows them his
ID card

In one corner we find Read glued to the receiver of a
payphone a finger in his free ear trying desperately to

EXT MONTREAL TRUCK DEPOT -- NIGHT

At a Montreal truck depot crates are being unloaded from a
warehouse and on to a series of trucks A dispatcher works

his way through the crowd of loaders looking for a missing

driver

DISPATCHER

The dispatcher shoves his way to the sliding side door of
Eddys trailer and grabs the handle

DISPATCHER
You in there Eddy We gotta get

The dispatcher slides the door open Eddy screams the second
the light hits him and jumps out at the dispatcher eyes
clouded over foaming mouth wide open The dispatcher is
bowled over by the force of the impact and he falls backwards
to the concrete Eddy all over him screaming and biting the
dispatchers face and arms

In an instant five loaders are trying to pull Eddy away
Eddy immediately turns on them managing to inflict several
bites before he disappears beneath the ever-increasing mass
of loaders and truckers trying to get at him

INT MINDYS APARTMENT -- NIGHT

Mindy is watching TV in her cramped one-bedroom downtown
high-rise apartment Mindy is twenty-one has lived on her
own for years is on the plump side of voluptuous and works
for IBM selling office equipment

As she watches her color portable Mindy idly turns the pages
of Vogue magazine smokes a cigarette and alternately sips

a cognac and a black coffee There is a special newscast
concerning the alleged rabies outbreak in the clinic region
complete with documentary footage shot outside the quarantined
QPP station

NEWSCASTER
and health officials have said
they consider the outbreak of the
new strain of rabies as being
potentially the worst of this
century At the police station in
Camelford Kathy Draper talked to
Quebec Bureau of Health official
Claude Lapointe

The news camera pans across the front of 52 station and ends
up in a close-up of Mr Lapointe standing in front of his
van

LAPOINTE
Certainly this is serious This is
not just a question of swine flu or
something like that We have already
several deaths on our hands in this
one small area alone and the main
problem is we dont know what
were up against

INTERVIEWER (0C)
Are you saying that this is not an
outbreak of rabies

LAPOINTE
Im not saying that
that exactly But it must be a new
strain of rabies because there are
symptoms involved which we and even
t
Ss

Im not saying

he world health community do not
familiar with

INTERVIEWER (0C)
hat are these symptoms

LAPOINTE

ell the period of incubation of

his disease is very brief maybe

ix to eight hours at the most Now
hats quick much quicker than normal
abies Then the victim begins to
weat to shake to foam at the mouth
hats not so rare What is rare is

TAdrHaKRAHat Ss

Pp
i
I

hat the victim always with
isease becomes violent and
ite somebody new And this
hase is followed by a coma
n every case we know
ts very strange

INTERVIEWER (0C)

this new
wants to
crazy

and then

by death

What advice would you give to our

Vv

iewers
LAPOINTE
The disease spreads through the saliva
of the victim the saliva is very
contagious It dribbles into open
wounds and cuts and causes immediate
infection

INTERVIEWER (0C)

So
LAPOINTE
(shrugging)
So dont let anybody bite you

And if somebody does find a doctor
who can give you rabies shots
immediately We are already setting

up vaccination centers beginning

right here and spreading out toward
Montreal If we dont keep the disease
localized and out of large centers

of population well I wouldnt

like to say what it could be like

INTERVIEWER (0C)
I heard you mention the Black Plague
of London just before we went on the
air Is that what you mean by

LAPOINTE

(laughing)
We sometimes like to be dramatic
about these things Its more
interesting than the usual paperwork
and we get you know we get
excited Its a real challenge

There is a knock at the door Mindy gets up and opens it
Standing in the corridor is Rose

ROSE
Surprise Im amongst the living

Mindy throws her arms around Rose hugs her and pulls her
inside the door They separate then hug again both of them

on the verge of tears

INT CAMELFORD STATION CELL -- NIGHT
Cypher and Read are sharing an open cell at the QPP station
which has been made as homely as possibly by the addition of
two chairs and a small table which Cypher is using as a
desk Read lies back on the lower half of one of the cells
three double bunk beds arms behind his head watching Cypher
sift through a maze of papers of all sizes and shapes

READ

CYPHER

(shakes his head)
I cant connect that creature I saw
in the paddy wagon with Danny I
just cant believe theyre all dead

Read is on the verge of saying something when they are both
startled by the sound of a sudden chase in the main office
at the end of the row of cells Screams and yells are
punctuated by the crash of overturned furniture and smashing
glass

Read and Cypher barely have time to get to their feet when
they see the head cop backing slowly through the door leading
to the main office his service revolver drawn

COP
George for Gods sake Cant you
understand what Im saying Stay
back Sit on the floor and put your
hands on your head

When the cop is about a third of the way down the aisle
between the rows of cells Read steps out behind him The
cop doesnt take his eyes away from the doorway
READ
Whats going on

COP
Get into the cell and be ready to
lock yourselves in Do what I tell
you

Before Read has a chance to move a second cop appears
sweating staggering drooling green foam eyes expressionless
black holes The infected cop is stalking the head cop
Somebody shouts from somewhere back in the main office

VOICE
Get out of the line of fire Ted
Well take him from here with the
scatterguns

COP

(shouting back)
Gimme a count of three Joe Ill be
outta your way by three

VOICE
One

The head cop draws even with the door of Read and Cyphers
cell Cypher has already backed into it and flattened himself
against the wall opposite the aisle The infected cop comes
closer Cypher notices the bandage on his hand then
recognizes him as the cop at the clinic entrance who was
bitten by Keloid and got rabies shots immediately afterwards

VOICE
Two

COP
(to Read and Cypher)
Gimme room Im coming in quick

VOICE
Three

The head cop dives sideways into the cell The infected cop
lunges forwards after him and is half-way through the cell
door when Read hanging on to the bars of the cell for
leverage puts his foot in the cops stomach and kicks him
back out into the line of fire Before the infected cop can
regain his balance he is punched to the floor by several
shotgun blasts

By the time the guns stop firing the infected cops body
has been pushed almost to the end of the aisle The head cop
steps out to meet the three cops from the main office who
approach warily through the acrid smoke drifting up from the
barrels of their guns

COP

(to nobody in

particular)
They gave him rabies shots He got
bitten up at that facelift place and
they gave him his shots right away

The head cop turns away from the body and looks up at the
three men from the main office

COP
They didnt do him any damn good
did they

Read and Cypher exchange glances Its been a lousy day
INT MINDYS LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

Mindy and Rose are sitting in Mindys living room Rose in
front of the TV on the sofa Mindy at a small desk in the
corner with papers and some sort of training manual spread
out in front of her Rose is watching TV with a long ear
plug trailing from the silent TV set across three feet of
rug up the sofa and into her left ear

Rose is watching Shivers starring Paul Hampton Joe Silver
and Barbara Steele and is getting very restless She cant
help glancing over at Mindy who is eating a ham sandwich
while she works Mindy has her hair pulled back and the pulse
in her neck is somehow very prominent Rose pulls the plug
out of her ear turns off the TV set stands up and goes to
the closet next to the front door Mindy looks up from her
work for the first time

MINDY
What are you doing Rose

ROSE
(putting on her jacket)
I think I have to go out for a while
Mindy gets up and joins Rose at the door

MINDY
Rosie I feel so stupid I havent
been much of a hostess Why dont
you stay here There must be something
in the fridge I can tempt you with

ROSE

(opening the door)
Thanks Mindy but its not that I
just have to get out into the fresh
air again Its a real experience
for me just to walk down a street

MINDY
Ill come with you

ROSE
No You stay here and work I wont
be gone too long

MINDY
OK Rosie If you get dizzy or
anything call me

Rose laughs pats Mindy on the cheek and leaves
EXT ST CATHERINES STREET -- NIGHT

Rose walks down the most crowded part of St Catherines
Street she can find She has a new sensitivity to the heat
radiating from the bodies of those close to her and the
presence of so much warm jostling flesh full of blood whose
coursing she can almost hear soon makes her eyes shine her
nostrils flare her steps quick and precise

Rose soon finds herself standing in front of an Eve Cinema
which is showing two soft-core skin flicks as usual On an
impulse Rose digs around in the pockets of Judy Glasbergs
jeans In the back pocket she finds a five-dollar bill She
hesitates for only a moment then buys a ticket and enters

the cinema

INT EVE CINEMA -- NIGHT

Rose walks down the center aisle and sits alone in the middle
of an empty row of seats not far from the screen and its
murky orgiastics
It is not long before a thirtyish balding man leaves his
seat at the back of the cinema and sits directly behind Rose
As he removes his jacket he brushes against Roses hair
with his hand as though by accident Rose turns around to
look at him

BALDING MAN
Scuse me I didnt mean to touch
you

Rose gives him a hard look then turns around to face the
screen again

BALDING MAN
Well pardon me for existing

Rose turns around again

ROSE
I thought you did it on purpose

BALDING MAN
No Really I was taking my jacket
off and it brushed against you

ROSE
Oh well Im sorry I like seeing
these movies but men are always
bothering me I guess Ima little
paranoid

BALDING MAN
Well look If I come and sit beside
you everybody will think were
together and youll be able to watch
in peace All I ask is a couple
handfuls of popcorn

ROSE
(Laughing)
OK Cmon

The balding man gets up moves to the end of his aisle then
makes his way toward Rose trying not to blow it by betraying
his excitement He sits down beside Rose She offers him

some popcorn

DISSOLVE TO
EXT EVE CINEMA EXIT -- NIGHT

Rose slips out of the side exit of the cinema into an alley
her cheeks flushed her breathing heavy Crowds of people
still throng past the opening at the end of the alley the
night just beginning Rose watches them move past as though
still watching a movie feeling the full weight of her
separation from the ordinary After a pause she moves out
to join it

INT EVE CINEMA -- NIGHT

Back in the theater the balding man is still sitting in his
seat three rows from the screen slumped down his head on
his chest one arm thrown out around the edge of the seat
beside him Blood streams from a small hole in the palm of
the outstretched hand which is still curved as though
embracing someones shoulder

The images reflecting from the screen flicker across his
face but he sees nothing

INT MINDYS LIVING ROOM -- MORNING

Mindy is preparing and eating her breakfast of bran muffins
coffee and orange juice on the run While she shuffles her
coffee cup and her notebooks she listens to the radio

NEWSCASTER (VO)
decide that each municipality
should take on the responsibility
for setting up vaccination centers
in community halls and health clinics
Police have criticized the City Hall
decision saying that evidence has
come to light which indicates that
normal rabies vaccine is completely
ineffective against the new strain
of the disease They are asking
instead for the organization of a
series of militia-and army-controlled
quarantine centers until such time
as an effective vaccine is developed
Said one police spokesman We are
having trouble containing the known
outbreaks of violence induced by the
disease as it is Imagine what will
happen if it spreads through the
city like a normal wave of the flu

Mindy has finally gotten herself ready to go to work Just
before she leaves she knocks on the bathroom door

MINDY
Im going Rosie Ive left you some
coffee on the stove Turn it off if
you go out OK

ROSE (0OS)
OK Bye

MINDY
(slightly worried
pause)
Arent you going to wish me luck
(pause)
Are you OK

ROSE (OS)
(oddly muffled)
Brushing my teeth Good luck

MINDY
(relaxing)
Thanks See you later

Mindy turns to the front door opens it and leaves
INT MINDYS BATHROOM -- MORNING

In the bathroom Rose is doubled over on the floor clutching
her stomach Two seconds after she hears the front door slam
closed she lets out a low strangled moan and begins to
roll around on the floor

A sudden spasm forces her to curl into a ball again her
fingernails sinking into the palms of her hands After the
spasm passes she props herself up against the bathroom door
A thread of blood curls down her wrist She opens her right
hand She stares at the four tiny crescents of blood that
her nails have cut into her palm With slow trancelike
motions she licks the blood off her wrist and her palm

INT SUBWAY STATION -- MORNING

Mindy stands in a crowded subway station waiting for her
train to come Every once in a while she glances down at a
marked page in a blue corporation manual shes carrying
checking her memory against the printed specifications of
various pieces of office equipment

The train finally comes and Mindy gets crammed in with the
rest of the rush-hour crowd

INT SUBWAY CAR -- MORNING

As the subway car pulls out of the station Mindy leans
against the door and continues to consult her manual As she
looks up and off into space trying to grasp the next set of
machine specifications her eye is caught by the face of a
woman with her back against the opposite door The woman
seems to be blind -- her eyes are completely black from edge
to edge

Then Mindy notices with horror that the woman is trembling
and drooling and foaming green at the mouth The sea of faces
between them seems indifferent to the woman until she screams
at the top of her lungs and plunges forward with her mouth
wide open apparently trying to get at Mindy

he people closest to the woman suddenly start to panic and
he panic moves out through the car in waves Everyone starts
o push and shove and people try to climb over one another
he infected woman manages to lock her teeth on to the ear

f a man who begins to punch her in the chest and stomach
imself completely terrified

souHadsy

he subway car pulls into the next station and its doors
pen Mindy is almost knocked to the platform and trampled
ut she manages to stay on her feet and flow with the
tampede

HnOOH

The people waiting to get on to the train are greeted with
the spectacle of three men subduing an insane shrieking
woman on the floor of the car

EXT DOWNTOWN CONSTRUCTION SITE -- DAY

Mr Lapointe Quebec Health Bureau official is riding in

the back of a city limousine with an official from the mayors
office The limousine is working its way through the rubble

of a deserted construction site

LAPOINTE
(exasperated)
Youll pardon me Mr Stasiuk but I
think the mayor should be taking
this epidemic more seriously than he
is

OFFICIAL
A city is a complex machine Mr
Lapointe Every part needs constant
attention The mayor will listen to
you but youre not the only one It
takes time

The limousine has worked its way into a relatively deserted
section of the site and now slows to a stop

OFFICIAL
(to uniformed driver)
Why have we stopped Clark

The driver points through the front windshield at the
mannequin of a construction worker waving a flag that has
been placed directly in the middle of the narrow dirt road
theyre travelling on

OFFICIAL
Well isnt there anyone around Do
we have to turn around

Before anyone can make a move two construction workers
suddenly emerge from the surrounding rubble and advance on
the car one of them carrying a pneumatic jackhammer

OFFICIAL
Clark roll down your window and
ask them why the road is blocked It
may be strike trouble Be careful

Clark is in the process of rolling down his window when the
man with the jackhammer turns on the hammer and applies the
chisel to the drivers door As the chisel point of the hammer
chews up the door Lapointe can see that the eyes of the two
workers are clouded over and that they are all slavering

green foam from their mouths

OFFICIAL
Oh Christ Clark lets get out
quick Quick man

LAPOINTE
Theyve got the disease Look at
their eyes

The young man fumbles in his jacket pocket for his pack of
cigarettes then awkwardly shakes one out of the pack for
Rose She takes it The young man puts one in his mouth
then starts to feel around in his pockets for matches He
cant find any

YOUNG MAN
No matches You got a light

Rose shakes her head The young man looks around He spots a
man with a cigarette in his hand at the end of the adjacent
bench He gets up

YOUNG MAN
Just a sec Ill ask that guy over
there for a light OK Be right back

He walks over to the man on the bench As he approaches he
notices that the mans cigarette has burned right down to
the flesh of his fingers

YOUNG MAN
Scuse me Mac Gotta light

Without warning the man on the bench leaps up at the young
man and grabs him by the hair The man a powerful bearded
man of about sixty has eyes like black holes and is drooling
green foam He pulls the young mans head back and begins to
tear at his throat with nicotine-stained teeth The young

man screams

The two cops break into a run the instant they locate the
source of the screams When they arrive at the bench the
bearded man looks up his beard and mouth stained with blood
The young man is quite obviously on the verge of death The
young cop levels his submachine-gun at the man

YOUNG COP
Stand up Stand up and put your hands
behind your head

The bearded man jumps up and tears off through the crowd of
incredulous onlookers The young cop follows him The bearded
man heads for the Santa Claus display

YOUNG COP
Outta the way Get outta the way
Hell kill you That manll kill
you

The children around the Santa Claus display scatter as the
bearded man heads for them The Santa Claus stands up and
grabs at the bearded man just as the young cop opens fire
with his submachine-gun His bullets rip through both men

and the entire display scattering bits of Christmas wrapping
and plastic fir trees everywhere

The older cop arrives on the scene revolver drawn just as
post-action shock hits the young cop

YOUNG COP
Oh Christ I didnt mean to hit
the Santa Claus

Deep in the gathering crowd a traumatized Rose pushes her
way through to an exit

INT CAMELFORD STATION -- DAY

We are close on a TV set sitting on the admitting sergeants
desk just inside the stations main entrance A detailed
analysis of the disease crisis is in the process of being
broadcast complete with news footage of army and militiamen
jumping off trucks in Place Ville Marie citizens being
vaccinated at community health centers and at emergency depots
set up in subway stations etc

NEWSCASTER (VO)
and the crisis has now been
officially granted epidemic status
by officials of the World Health
Organization The Prime Minister was
reluctant to officially declare a
state of emergency but as any citizen
in the streets can tell you martial
law has come to Montreal At an
emergency vaccination center set up
in the Atwater Metro Station we
spoke with a director of the World
Health Organization who had just
arrived from England to take charge
of liaison with Health Bureaus in
Western European countries

The face of an aristocratic and very tweedy Englishman appears
on the screen with the name Dr Royce Gentry Director WHO
flashing beneath his face on the screen for a moment or two

GENTRY
I dont think theres any question
that martial law is needed in the
city of Montreal at this point in
time Its a necessity It has already
been established that victims of the

disease -- and it is not rabies
though it may be related to the rabies
virus -- victims of the disease are

beyond medical help once it has
established itself to the degree of
inducing violent behavior

INTERVIEWER (0OC)
What youre saying then Dr Gentry
is that

GENTRY

hat Im saying is very simple It
ay not be very palatable for your
iewers Shooting down victims of
he disease is as good a way of
andling them as weve got If we
ock them up they immediately go
nto a coma and die shortly
fterwards Weve now got a vaccine
hat we think will work ina
preventative way but for those who
are already incubating the disease
as far as we know theres no hope
for them

tCoPHEpypt GBS

The face of Dr Gentry is replaced by a close-up of a needle
sinking into an arm

NEWSCASTER (VO)
All those receiving shots of the new
vaccine are being issued plastic ID
cards with a photo of the card holder

Viewers are urged not to leave their
homes unless absolutely necessary
and are reminded that if they do

they must carry their vaccine cards
with them Police army and militia
officers may demand to see them

Here is a list of vaccination centers
in your area and the toll-free
telephone number of our special
emergency information center

Read and Cypher rumpled and haggard are signing forms at
the main desk of the station prior to being released Both
are wearing plastic vaccination plates on their jackets

Cypher nods and starts his car They pull out of the parking
lot and on to the highway

INT MINDYS BEDROOM -- LATE DAY

Rose lies curled up in Mindys double bed the blankets
twisted up around her sweating her shoes still on her
muscles contracting with waves of spasms that roll over her

Rose hardly notices the sound of keys jingling the latch
turning the front door opening Mindys home

MINDY (0S)
(closing the door and
locking it)

Rose Are you home

We hear the sound of Mindy walking through her living room
then approaching the bedroom

MINDY
Rose Are you asleep

Mindy enters the bedroom a bag of groceries in her arms
She stops at the door shocked at Roses appearance then
puts the bag down on her night table and sits on the bed
beside Rose

MINDY
Have you been out Have you gotten
your shot

Rose rolls over to face Mindy Her lips are pale and parched
her nose is running her voice shakes as she speaks

ROSE

(feebly)
I Ive been afraid to go out
And Mindy I Im starving Im

starving to death And I dont want
to eat I dont want any more to
eat
She bursts into tears and rolls away from Mindy who slides
across the bed after her and begins to stroke Roses forehead

MINDY
Rosie whats been going on Whats
the matter with you Poor kid Well
dont worry any more Were two tough
ladies you and me We can handle
anything we have to

EXT EXPRESSWAY RAMP -- DUSK

Read and Cypher descend into the city on a long expressway
ramp which affords them a clear view of other sections of
highway and a large suburban plaza dominated by a huge
supermarket

Both their ramp and the other sections of highway are strewn
with wrecked and burned-out cars and even the occasional
body

As the station wagon descends they can see the line-up of
people moving in and out of the supermarket guarded by
soldiers with light machine-guns Before anyone is allowed
into the supermarket he has to present his vaccine card at
a registration desk set up at the entrance

Cypher and Read plunge on deeper into the city
DISSOLVE TO
EXT STREET AT FOOT OF EXIT RAMP -- NIGHT

The station wagon swings off the exit ramp and on to a city
street narrowly missing a few piles of garbage which seems
to be everywhere

The street seems to be deserted the stores on both sides
closed and dark

EXT ANOTHER STREET -- NIGHT

The station wagon turns on to a long broad practically
deserted street The only human activity is centered around
a convoy of heavy white city garbage trucks manned by white-
uniformed hooded figures The convoy of twelve is led by a
military jeep whose rider an army sergeant orders them to
peel off one by one down specific routes deemed primary for
decontamination
Armed soldiers ride on the tops of the trucks carrying rifles
with telescopic sights

INT STATION WAGON -- NIGHT

READ
I cant believe it Its like we
were at war

CYPHER
Listen Hart Were going to my house
first Im not going to relax until
I know that everything theres OK
Once were there Ill give you the
keys to the car and you can go get
your girl

READ
(tense)
OK Thanks

EXT LEAFY SUBURBAN STREET -- NIGHT

The station wagon pulls up into the driveway of Cyphers

small but pleasant suburban house Except for a bit of garbage
strewn about there are no signs of unrest in the
neighborhood The odd rifle shot in the distance is fairly
easy to ignore in these surroundings

INT STATION WAGON -- NIGHT

Cypher gets out of the car and Read slides over into the
drivers seat

CYPHER
Phone me when you get there will
you Maybe you should bring Rose
back here with you until this thing
blows over

READ
Yeah Listen thanks for the car
Murray Ill call you

Cypher smiles and heads up the driveway toward his front
door Read waits until Cypher has safely let himself into
his house then pulls out of the driveway and on to the
street
INT CYPHERS HOUSE FIRST FLOOR -- NIGHT

Cypher enters his house and closes the door behind him He
puts his briefcase down on top of the hall radiator and walks
toward the foot of the stairs

CYPHER
Cecile Its Murray honey Im home

Nobody answers Cypher resists the temptation to panic and
walks through the downstairs rooms Everything seems
reasonably neat but there is no one there Cypher returns to
the foot of the stairs and starts the climb to the second
floor

INT CYPHERS HOUSE SECOND FLOOR -- NIGHT

Cypher gets to the top of the stairs and begins to move along
the narrow hall taking him to the front of the house

CYPHER
Cecile Im home honey Where are
you

Cypher stops at the doorway of the babys room and looks in
INT CYPHERS HOUSE BABYS ROOM -- NIGHT

Cypher scans the babys room which from its cartoon wallpaper
to its brightly colored broadloom and toy-filled shelves
speaks volumes about the fastidious preparation which preceded
babys arrival

e is about to continue on down the hall to the master bedroom
hen he notices that the broadloom beneath the babys
athinette is wet On an impulse he enters the room and lifts
pen the top covering the bathinette The bathinette is half-
illed with bloody bath water which has been leaking on to

he carpeting drop by drop for hours

moos m

ct

Cypher lets the lid drop down with a mixture of fear and

horror suddenly stabbing him in the pit of the stomach An
insane kind of moaning giggle drifts over to him from the
corner of the room

He whirls to face the sound It seems to be coming from the
closet Drawn inexorably toward the sound he approaches the
closet which is not completely closed He raises his hand

to grasp the doorknob

Without warning the closet door explodes open smashing
Cypher in the face and knocking him to the floor A crazed
drooling Cecile lands heavily on top of him and begins to
bite him savagely on the face her clouded eyes devoid of
all mercy or recognition

INT MINDYS BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Mindy has tucked Rose into bed and is now applying a cold
compress to her feverish forehead Rose seems to be half
asleep

MINDY
Thats it Rosie You just get as
much sleep as you need Dont think
about anything Let your mind drift

Mindy gets up and goes into her kitchen leaving Roses door
open just a crack

INT MINDYS KITCHEN -- NIGHT

In her kitchen Mindy continues preparing an elaborate
vegetable stew somehow convinced that her weeks in the
hospital have induced in Rose an aversion to meat

The TV set Mindys constant companion has been turned around
so that Mindy can just see it from where shes working
although the sound has been turned off in deference to Rose
At the moment there seems to be a detailed analysis of the
difference between rabies and the new strain of disease
holding the city in thrall complete with microphotography

in progress

INT MINDYS BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Rose takes the compress from her forehead and places it
carefully on the night table She slips out of bed and begins
to rummage around in the closet for her clothes

EXT DOWNTOWN STREET -- NIGHT

Read drives Cyphers station wagon along a downtown street
on his way to Mindys There are more people on this
particular street than the ones he and Cypher first
encountered In fact were it not for the heavily armed
soldiers placed at several strategic points and the single
guarded garbage truck making its rounds all would seem
normal The sound of sporadic gunfire in the distance seems
to have been accepted as everyday fare by everybody

But Reads focus of attention is on the car radio He has
been listening to an analysis of the possible origins of the
disease and the information hes getting is disturbing him
The voice on the radio is that of Dr Royce Gentry

GENTRY (VO)
And so after using some rather
elaborate tracking procedures and
applying them to a map we find that
the disease does in fact seem to
have a very specific place of origin

INTERVIEWER (VO)
Which is

GENTRY (VO)
hich is the Keloid Clinic of Cosmetic
urgery a few miles outside the
own of Camelford You can see with
our own eyes how everything has
pread out from there in geometrically
ncreasing proportions Now this
attern in conjunction with some of
ur other statistics indicates that
here is a strong possibility that
here is a special factor at work in
he spread of the disease

tttOvUrFukdns

INTERVIEWER (VO)
You mean a carrier

GENTRY (VO)
Well at the risk of setting off a
futile witch hunt Yes Someone
like the infamous Typhoid Mary who
incubates the disease and transmits
it but is herself immune to it

INTERVIEWER (VO)
What were they doing at the Keloid
Clinic Dr Gentry

GENTRY (VO)
Weve run into a certain amount of
difficulty ascertaining what exactly
was going on there We know what it
wasnt It had nothing to do with
germ warfare or the like no secret
government contracts

Reads concentration is suddenly shattered by a movement he
catches in the corner of his rear-view mirror as he waits

for a light to change A crazy -- a man in his forties wearing
a scarf and gloves but no coat -- breaks out from between

two buildings just behind Reads car and heads for the
clusters of people crossing at the light

Read watches the man brush by the car as though watching the
scene on television The people in the crosswalk scatter at
the crazys approach The sniper on top of the garbage truck
has him safely in his crosshairs and squeezes off a shot
The crazy hurtles against the hood of the station wagon as
though falling from a building and bounces off and on to the
road

Before Read can drive off two garbage men run toward him
from the garbage truck One of them holds up his hand for
Read to wait He produces a spray bottle from under his white
jumpsuit and sprays the crazys blood that has spattered the
cars hood Then he waves Read on Read puts his windshield
wipers on

INT MINDYS APARTMENT -- NIGHT

Rose is dressed and trying to steal out the front door when
Mindy hears her from the kitchen

MINDY (0OS)
Rose Are you awake

Rose yanks open the door and has one foot out the door when
Mindy appears around the corner with a dish of sauce in her
hand

MINDY
Oh no Rose You cant Its
dangerous out there

Mindy bangs the plate down on top of a stereo speaker and
runs after Rose She catches her a few steps out the door
and hauls her back inside swinging the door shut again with
her foot The door doesnt lock

Rose is whimpering and weak She starts to sink to the floor
and Mindy not strong enough to hold her up goes with her

ROSE
Mindy Mindy I dont want it to be
you

Mindy hugs Rose tightly rocking her back and forth

MINDY
Of course it should be me Who else
but your best friend Rose Ill
take care of you

ROSE

(pause)
Oh Mindy I ache all over Im
hurting from the inside out

MINDY
Well then what you need is a nice
deep hot bath Itll seep in and
relax you from the outside in

She starts to unbutton Roses shirt Rose doesnt resist
EXT MINDYS APARTMENT BUILDING -- NIGHT

Read parks the station wagon in front of Mindys building
and gets out He sprints up the front steps

INT APARTMENT CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

Read emerges from the elevator at the end of the corridor
and walks purposefully past the row of doors until he reaches
Mindys

He reaches for the door He notices that its ajar and pulls
back his hand at the last minute He takes a deep breath
then kicks open the door

INT MINDYS APARTMENT -- NIGHT

As the front door of Mindys apartment slams open Read is
confronted by the bizarre spectacle of Rose hunched over
Mindys prostrate form sucking blood from the large vein in
one of Mindys arms

The instant the door slams open Rose pulls her blood-sucking
organ out of Mindys arm and tries to hide it with her right
hand The organ still dripping blood slides back up under
her arm into its sheath The half-conscious Mindy puts her
hand over the hole in her arm and mumbles incoherently

As Read approaches Rose backs away slipping her left arm
back into her shirt and fumbling with the buttons Rose now
looks flushed and healthy excited and alive

ROSE
(quietly)
Its not my fault Its not my fault

READ
Its you Youre the one Its been
you all along

ROSE
What are you talking about

READ
You carry the plague Youve killed
hundreds of people

ROSE
No no you dont know what youre
talking about Im still me Im
still Rose

READ
What did they do to you at the clinic
What did they turn you into

ROSE

(suddenly angry)
I have to have blood Its all I can
eat And its your fault not mine
Its your fault

Read takes three quick steps and grabs Rose by the shoulders
She shrinks away from him as though he were the monster

There must be some way to fix this

Rose twists out of Reads grasp and runs for the front door
Read turns and runs after her almost tripping over Mindy
Rose makes it out the door before Read can catch her

Read chases Rose down the corridor

READ
Rose Im sorry wait Wait
INT STAIRWELL -- NIGHT

Read finally manages to catch Rose at the top of the
stairwell They struggle

READ
Rose listen to me Youre right
Were in it together Well figure
it all out together

As they struggle Rose somehow smashes Read in the face with
her elbow and he goes crashing backwards down the flight of

stairs hitting his head several times on the metal steps as
he goes

She watches in horror as Read falls then stands frozen for
several heartbeats after he has landed in a crumpled heap at
the bottom of the stairs She runs down after him and kneels
beside him

He has a few large bruises on his forehead and temples but
is still breathing Rose touches his lips with her fingers
briefly then gets up and continues down the stairs

EXT ENTRANCE OF MINDYS APARTMENT -- NIGHT

Rose opens the front door of the apartment building and steps
out on to the front steps bewildered There she sees a man
with a mustache sifting through a handful of letters on the
bottom step He looks up at the sound of the door opening

MUSTACHIOED MAN

EXT APARTMENT -- NIGHT

Night has fallen over Mindys apartment and the streets are
dark and completely deserted

INT STAIRWELL -- NIGHT

Read is only now regaining consciousness in the damp apartment
stairwell He rubs his neck and gradually manages to get to
his feet The top of the stairs looks as though its a mile
away Read begins to climb the stairs one painful step ata
time

INT CORRIDOR -- NIGHT
As Read staggers down the corridor he hears a telephone

begin to ring in the distance The ringing gets louder and
somehow more persistent as he gets closer to Mindys door
INT MINDYS APARTMENT -- NIGHT

The telephone is patiently ringing in Mindys apartment as
though waiting for Read to answer it He enters the apartment
and takes a quick look around for signs of Mindy The place
is empty He swings the door shut and locks it Only then
does he turn to the phone

Read answers the telephone

READ
Hello

INT MUSTACHES APARTMENT -- NIGHT

Rose has locked herself into the single mans apartment and
slid a heavy table across the door The single man sits
slumped in an old wingback chair his cheek bloody his eyes
closed

Rose has turned out all the lights in the apartment except
for a small mood light near the telephone which sits on an
end table by a Victorian velvet sofa She speaks quietly
into the receiver as though not wanting to wake the
mustachioed man

ROSE
Its me Hart Im glad I managed to
get you Are you all right Did I
hurt you

READ (VO)
Rose where are you We should be
together Please tell me where you

ROSE
Well what you said to me hurt me

suddenly knew you might be right
And if you were right about my being

a carrier I mean then I I
murdered Mindy I murdered a lot of
people

READ (VO)
Rose listen to me No court of

law would convict you
ROSE
So I decided to try a little
experiment to prove that you were
wrong about all that You see Im
being very positive arent I

READ (VO)
Theres no reason for you to put
yourself through anything like this

ROSE
So I found myself a partner for my
experiment a single guy real normal
and real healthy and I took a little
of his blood just a bit and
Ive locked myself in with him And
Im going to stay here with him until
Im sure hes not going to get sick
And then Ill know that Im not the
one who started it all

READ

INT MUSTACHES APARTMENT -- NIGHT

As Read talks Rose hears a sound behind her She turns to
see a shadow rising out of the chair behind her The shadow
seems immense

READ (VO)
Please Rose just drop the phone
and walk over to the door and run
outta that place as fast as you can
Youre not giving either of us a
chance to think We dont need this
pressure everythings so
confused Weve got to just clear
a space where we can be alone and
sit down and talk about everything
and figure out what to do Rose
Get out of there get out right now

The shadow approaches Rose who lies as still as death on
the sofa The single man is finally caught by the edge of
the mood lights glow and Rose can see the dead black eyes
the drooling green saliva the slack hungry lips

ROSE
Hart Im afraid

The single man lunges for Roses throat
INT MINDYS APARTMENT -- NIGHT
Read screams into the phone

READ
Rose Rose

He is in agony as he hears the sounds of Rose being torn
apart at the other end of the line but he is unable to take
the receiver away from his ear unable to desert Rose in her
final moments He screams insanely into the phone this time
incoherently trying to make it stop trying to cover it up
But it doesnt stop

EXT DOWNTOWN INTERSECTION -- DAWN

In the chill of early morning an armed garbage truck moves
through the city collecting bodies left in the aftermath of
the nights anonymous violence

DISSOLVE TO

EXT MINDYS STREET -- DAWN
On Mindys street just a few blocks away from Mindys
apartment a garbage truck stops to collect a body covered
with dried blood that has been dragged out on to the front
steps of an apartment building Before the garbage men can
get the body the sniper on the roof has to shoot a dog who
is sniffing at the body

The garbage men are then able to get to the body spray it
with disinfectant spray the dogs body and drag them back
to the trucks compressor As the body is dumped into the
back of the truck we see that it is possibly Roses

THE END
