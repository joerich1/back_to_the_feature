EXT RURAL ROAD - DAY

A two-lane road carves through an endless forest of towering
black spruce A flock of pintails skims over the treetops
heading south before the first snowfall

A young BOY undersized and feral trudges home

strapped to his back Black-haired and pale-skinned the boy
looks as if he hasnt had a good meal in a long time
Before we hear anything the boy turns watching the bend in
the road behind him After a moment we hear the thrum of a
hard-charging engine

An Oldsmobile Super 88 rounds the bend accelerating as it
hits the straightaway The boy steps away from the road but
the car comes straight at him

The boy closes his eyes The Oldsmobiles brakes clamp down
on the wheels and the car shivers to a halt with inches to
spare Laughter spills from the cars open windows

Four HIGH SCHOOL LETTERMEN pile out of the car wearing

leather-sleeved football jackets GILMAN the largest of the
four shakes his head and laughs

GILMAN

Kid didnt even move You see that

Wheres your survival instincts

boy

The boy says nothing He readjusts his bookbag and resumes
his long walk northward

GILMAN (contd)

Hey

Gilman grabs the boys shoulder and spins him around-
GILMAN (contd)

The hell you going You hear me

talking to you

One of the other football players MASON walks over and
inspects the boys face

MASON
This is the kid whose old man
robbed the truck stop last year
neck

Gilman curls his meaty hand around the back of the boys

and pulls him closer scrutinizing him The four lettermen
tower over the small boy
I CONTTNTT f 1

GILMAN
You the one with the convict daddy
The boy stares back at Gilman unblinking

MASON
Thats him

GILMAN

Whats the matter you about to

piss your pants Answer me

The boy says nothing never looking away from the bully
Gilman presses his fist adorned with a heavy class ring
against theboys cheek

GILMAN (contd)

You a tough guy like your daddy

Gilman shoves the boy forcing him to stumble backwards The
boy regains his balance never taking his eyes off Gilman
GILMAN (contd)

You want to play tough guy with me

Huh

Provoked by the boys lack of fear by the insolence of his
stare Gilman rears back and punches him in the face

The boy falls to the ground Blood spills from a gash in his
cheek where the class ring cut him

MASON

(a ringside announcer)

Right cross to the face and hes

down

The football players laugh looking down at the fallen boy
The boy stands There is still no sign of emotion on his
face No fear no anger no evident pain

GILMAN
boy

shirt

punch

bite

Whats the matter You want some
more
The boy doesnt look away The bully swings cracking the

in the side of the head knocking him down again
GILMAN (contd)

(to his friends)

Lets get out of here

CONTTNTTFT) I

Walking back to the car Mason slaps Gilman on the shoulder

MASON

You gave that little pissant

something to think about

Gilman grins and looks back at the boy expecting him to be
sprawled and crying on the ground

Instead the boy stands again brushes the dirt off his

and walks toward Gilman

GILMAN
You got to be kidding me Im gonna

knock the--

But Gilmans words die in his throat as he sees something
impossible happening The gash on the boys cheek knits
itself shut leaving no sign of injury

Gilman is so shocked he doesnt see the boys fist whizzing
toward him striking him in the nose And then another

And then another

The boy is far smaller and weaker than Gilman but he fights
with a ferocity that seems inhuman punching and kicking and
headbutting doing whatever it takes to fell his enemy
Gilman stunned by the intensity of the assault goes down
trying to protect his face from the blur of blows

Mason tries to pull the boy off his friend and suffers a

to the hand He howls with pain and backs off
The other two football players amazed to see their leader
crawl

getting pummeled by a boy half his size watch in awe

The boy growls as he batters the bully He grabs Gilmans
collar and lifts the football players head off the ground
prepared to deliver the coup de grace with his right fist
Three bone claws spring from the boys hand serrated and
razor sharp

Everything stops Mason clutching his wounded hand quits
hollering and stares The other two football players blink
and slowly back away

Even Gilman moaning on the ground hushes and tries to

backwards away from this beast on top of him

((“ONTTN11F1)1

But the boy is more shocked than-any of them He stares with
horror at the claws this part of him he never knew existed
He stands and stumbles away from Gilman Mason runs over
lifts his punch-drunk friend to his feet and hustles him
toward the Oldsmobile

The other football players pile in slam the doors shut and
speed off leaving the boy alone by the side of the road
The boy stares at his claws and for the first time we see
fear in his eyes He screams a scream that echoes over the
black spruce into the darkening northern sky

INT CABIN - MORNING

LOGAN wakes with a wordless shout sitting upright
shirtless in a bed covered with shredded bedsheets

KAYLA SILVERFOX wraps her arms around him and whispers
in his ear

KAYLA

Its okay shh its okay

Logan pants chest heaving eyes wild gripping the tattered
sheets in his fists Kayla holds him tight until his bone
claws retract

KAYLA (contd)

Im right here with you Okay Im

He

Tilt-

shoot-

Kayla a full-blooded Innu wears her long black hair pulled
back in a ponytail Shes been sleeping in one of Logans
flannel shirts

KAYLA (contd)

The war dreams or the one where

Logan takes a deep breath finally calming down He relaxes
into Kaylas arms

LOGAN

The one where Ima kid

Kayla runs her fingers through his thick hair kissing his
forehead He sees that she has a small cut on her forearm

takes her arm and looks at the wound

((ONTTN111 T)1

LOGAN (contd)
I cut you

KAYLA

Its nothing Just a scratch
She kisses him

KAYLA (contd)

We need new sheets again baby

EXT CARNIVAL - NIGHT

A traveling carnival has come to a seaside New England town
The brightly-lit Ferris Wheel spins a few hundred yards
inland from the dark Atlantic

LOCALS roam through the carnival lining up to ride the

A-Whirl KIDS carrying plumes of cotton candy race from
em-up games to free throw competitions
A CARNY BARKER of the old school wearing a patched-suit and

a derby beckons the curious to his attraction

CARNY BARKER
toward

wings

Come see the notorious Bird Man

Half-man half-eagle is he an

angel from Heaven or a spawn of

Satan Ladies and gentlemen

tonight is your last chance to see

the creature youve all been

hearing about

We follow two BOYS who hand the barker their tickets pull
aside the curtain and step into the sideshow

INT SIDESHOW - CONTINUOUS

-joining a small crowd of CURIOUS ONLOOKERS The tent is
dark save for a spotlight fixed on a tiny stage

SHERRLENE a peroxide-blonde in her fifties whose tanned
hide is covered with interlaced tattoos slaps a tribal beat
on a pair of bongos

The crowd hushes A tall man in a hooded robe shuffles

the stage like a boxer long past his prime He stands in
front of the gawkers head bowed face shadowed by his hood

1 RENTTNTTPD 1

Finally BEAK throws off his robe and raises his wings to the
crowd As advertised he looks like an amalgam of man and
bird with three-toed clawed feet and dirty-feathered

His very human tired brown eyes are set in a face dominated
by a long sharp beak He stares back at the gaping crowd
Beak looks more pathetic than monstrous His skinny limbs
dont seem very strong and he projects an air of weary
resignation not menace

But when he flaps his gray wings and caws at the onlookers
the children shriek in terror and bury their faces in their
fathers legs

INT BEAKS TRAILER - NIGHT

Sherrlene and Beak sit at a card table playing gin and
drinking bourbon
SHERRLENE
Im gonna knock with three

BEAK
Are you kidding me
He throws down his hand in disgust

SHERRLENE
You always hold out for gin You
could have knocked a while ago

BEAK
Yeah well Im an eternal
optimist

Sherrlene tallies the points

SHERRLENE

All right Im gonna hit it You
want to come look for shells with
me on the beach tomorrow

BEAK
I dont want to scare away any
tourists

SHERRLENE

Aw sweetie its winter No
tourists Ill come get you in the
morning

(rr)NTTNTrd r) 1

Sherrlene collects her things stands and kisses Beak on
the

side of his feathered head

BEAK
Goodnight Sherrlene

SHERRLENE
Night Beak Sweet dreams
Sherrlene closes the door behind her and Beak flips through
the deck of cards preparing for another lonely night
A knock on the door

BEAK

You forget your purse

(another knock)

All right all right Im coming
He stands and opens the door

EXT BEAKS TRAILER - CONTINUOUS

A towering figure in a long black coat looms beside the
trailers door

BEAK

Shows over pal

VICTOR CREED is shrouded in shadows but when he grins his
white fangs gleam He drapes his arm around Beak and drags
the birdman inside the trailer

VICTOR CREED
Shows never over for you freak

INT BEAKS TRAILER - CONTINUOUS

BEAK
You want money Theres twenty
bucks on the dresser Thats all I

VICTOR CREED

Creed shoves Beak back into his seat picks up the bottle of
bourbon examines the label and guzzles it Beak opens his
mouth but no words come out Finally

(RONTTNTIED

BEAK

Creed wipes his lips with the back of his clawed hand
BEAK (contd)

But you youre one of us

VICTOR CREED

Creed smiles down at his feathered target Beak tries to
shield his body with his wings

BEAK

VICTOR CREED
Let me show you how its done

EXT BEAKS TRAILER - CONTINUOUS
An awful prolonged shriek escapes from the trailer
EXT CABIN - DAY

The small log cabin sits in a clearing in a jack pine

forest
Winter has come to the north country the ground and tree
branches are covered with several inches of snow
Logan chops firewood behind the cabin splitting the logs
with expert axe strikes smoking a cheap cigar
His nose wrinkles as he sniffs the air
LOGAN
Smells like government
Behind Logan two approaching men in dark suits and black
overcoats glance at each other Logan halving another block
of wood doesnt turn around
One of the newcomers STRYKER was a colonel in the Special
Forces He still has the look His hair is cropped short
his

bearing is military and his blue eyes are fierce

CHRISTOPH NORD AKA AGENT ZERO looks more like a death

row convict than a military man A family of tattooed
spiders

between these two and clearly the memories are not fond

Agent Zero grins There is nothing pleasant about his grin

AGENT ZERO

LOGAN

(puffing on his cigar)

Still shooting first asking

questions later

In one blindingly fast motion Agent Zero pulls a customized
automatic from his shoulder holster fires and reholsters

AGENT ZERO
Still smoking cheap cigars

Logan spits the butt of the severed cigar from his mouth and

clenches his fists

( CONTTNTTFTL

LOGAN

Stryker holds up both hands one palm to Logan

STRYKER

time

LOGAN

STRYKER

Logan turns away from them He tosses aside the axe picks

a load of firewood and stacks it beside the cabin

STRYKER (contd)

Youre a born warrior You can hide
up here as long as you want thats
never gonna change

LOGAN
Not interested

Agent Zero grins enjoying the game Stryker seeing that
this is going badly tries to break the tension

STRYKER

special qualities Men like you

LOGAN

Logan walks around to the front of the cabin Stryker and
Agent Zero follow Logans battered old pickup truck is
parked beside the newcomers Lincoln

STRYKER

after some very bad people

Logan climbs into the drivers seat
STRYKER (contd)

You read the papers Logan Theyre

Logan closes the door turns the key and revs the engine to
warm it Stryker taps on the window Logan grits his teeth
and rolls down the window not looking at the colonel
STRYKER (contd)

Listen to me They have names They

have addresses

LOGAN

STRYKER
All right forget about yourself
Your country needs you

LOGAN

He hits the gas forcing Stryker to jump back lest the tires
run over his foot Stryker and Agent Zero watch him go

EXT DISTRICT UNIFIED SCHOOL - DAY

Logan parks in the lot of a sprawling brick grammar school
He gets out of the truck and walks toward the main building
The school day has ended STUDENTS meet up with their MOMS

DADS for the ride home

As Logan rounds a corner he stops in his tracks looking
around Somethings not quite right

Loganducks his head at the last possible second and a
snowball whizzes past missing him by inches

Six FOURTH GRADERS (four boys and two girls) charge at him
hurling snowballs and screaming

FOURTH GRADERS
Get him
Logan jumps back around the corner out of sight The fourth
graders chase after him round the corner with their

hands cocked ready to launch some serious ice
Logan is nowhere in sight
The fourth graders turn in confused circles searching for

second-

graders

their target snowballs melting in their hands

LOGAN (0S)
Hey fellas
The boys and girls look up and see Logan sitting on a

floor window ledge He has already formed six perfect
snowballs with which he proceeds to pelt the fourth

The kids run screaming and laughing nearly colliding with
Kayla who rounds the corner and stares up at Logan

KAYLA
Nice
Logan caught with a snowball in his hand looks sheepish

LOGAN
They started it

INT PICKUP TRUCK - LATER

Logan drives Kayla home over roads slick with black ice She
sings softly along with the country song on the radio

LOGAN
Stryker came by the house today

KAYLA

Stryker Colonel Stryker The one

(off Logans nod)

What did he want

LOGAN
Wants me back

KAYLA
And

LOGAN
Told him no
KAYLA
So why cant they get someone else
Logan thinks about it for a moment When he speaks there is

degree of self-loathing in his tone

LOGAN

m the best there is at what I do

And what I do best isnt very nice

ayla studies the side of his face for a moment
LOGAN (contd)
Maybe hes right Maybe its the
only thing Im good for
ayla watches him Logan shakes his head as if ridding
himself of an errant thought

LOGAN (contd)
Son of a bitch had me thinking

about it for a minute

He wraps his arm around her shoulders and pulls her closer
f£ CONTTN11Fn1

LOGAN (contd)

Im not going anywhere First time
in my life I dont feel like a
freak

KAYLA
Hey Youre not a freak

LOGAN

Most guys dont have to worry about
gutting their girlfriend when they
have a bad dream

KAYLA
Youre not a freak Youve got a
gift

LOGAN
A gift
Logan shakes his head staring at the black ribbon of road
LOGAN (contd)
You can return a gift

INT CABIN - NIGHT

A well-built fire burns in the fireplace Logan and Kayla
sit
naked in front of it wrapped in an old flannel quilt

KAYLA

The kids made cornhusk dolls today

in Arts and Crafts

She reaches for her bag and pulls out a little doll
KAYLA (contd)

I made one for you

Kayla hands him the doll and he examines it by firelight
Given the limitations of the art form its a skillful
representation of Logan unique hairstyle and all

LOGAN
I look like Elvis

KAYLA

Youre Elvis with claws

The moon swollen and red-hued rises above the dark hills
framed in the cabins window

I coNTTNTTRn 1

LOGAN
Full moon tomorrow

KAYLA

You know why the moons so lonely

Logan shakes his head Kayla lies back resting her head on
Logans leg as he plays with her hair

KAYLA (contd)

She used to have a lover

Kuekuatsheu They lived in the

Spirit World and every night theyd

wander the skies together But one
of the other spirits was jealous
Trickster wanted the Moon for
himself So he told Kuekuatsheu the
Moon asked for flowers He told him
to come to our world and pick her
some wild roses

LOGAN
Never trust a guy named Trickster

KAYLA

Yeah well you do some stupid
things when youre in love
uekuatsheu didnt know that once
you leave the Spirit World you can
never go back Now hes trapped
here Every night the Moon searches
for him and every night he sees her
in the sky and howls her name
but he can never touch her again
For a moment theyre both quiet contemplating the sad myth

LOGAN
oo-koo-choo got screwed

KAYLA
uekuatsheu The Wolverine

EXT CABIN - NIGHT

Viewed from a distance the little cabin looks warm and

inviting the firelight shining from the windows

Something watches from the edge of the dark woods
Something

monstrous its black talons carving gashes in the trunk of a

pine tree

EXT LOGGING CAMP - MORNING
Kayla drops Logan off at the logging camp The site is

already loud with motorized activity TRIMMERS remove the
limbs from fallen trees TEAMSTERS in forklifts load logs
onto flatbed trucks
Logan comes around to the drivers side window holding his
orange Husqvarna chainsaw in one hand

KAYLA
Be careful

Logan bends forward to kiss her on the lips He turns and

walks towards a crew of LUMBERJACKS circled around a

SUPERVISOR with a clipboard

Logan turns when he hears a honk Kayla leans out the
window

KAYLA (contd)

Logan notices that dozens of lumberjacks are watching this

scene He clears his throat

LOGAN

T love you too

SUPERVISOR

(thick Maine accent)

We all love you Casanova but

to let some daylight in the swamp

The lumberjacks laugh loudly Damage done Kayla waves a

cheerful goodbye and drives away from the camp

Logan trudges into the circle of lumberjacks who make
kissie-

The foreman thinks about it sighs and changes his tune
FOREMAN (contd)

Moments later the truck rolls forward enabling Kayla to
scoot through in her pickup She toots her horn and waves

KAYLA
Thanks fellas

EXT TIMBER STAND - MORNING

Logan and three other lumberjacks-- PHELAN MARCUSE and VAN
MIER-- tramp through the woods towards their designated

carrying their chainsaws and helmets
Phelan whiskey-bellied and flushed from the exertion has
fallen behind

PHELAN
You all want to ease the pace a

little bit Trees aint going

Logan in the lead stares at a crude smiley face carved

a tall pine tree His gaze travels from the carving to
something sitting on the forest floor

Lollys get the adverbs here

Rounding a corner on the narrow access road Kayla nearly
collides with a man in a long black coat She slams on the
brakes and the truck shudders to a halt

The mans back is turned to the truck his head bowed His
hair hangs below his shoulders clotted with dirt as if

hes
been sleeping in the woods for weeks
ayla leans out of the open truck window Before she can
speak the man in the long black coat turns
Its not just his size that frightens us though the man is
massive Its not just the four-inch-long black talons
curling from his fingertips or the gleaming fangs he licks
as he smiles at her
What terrifies us most are his eyes They are a sharks

Victor Creed walks toward the truck He scrapes his talons
over the hood screeeeee Five parallel gashes now scar the
hood carved straight through the steel

EXT TIMBER STAND - CONTINUOUS

Logan hearing a noise the other men cant rises from his
crouch He looks to the west listening carefully

PHELAN

Whats the matter--

Logan holds up a hand quiet He hears a distant scream A
voice he knows better than any other

He runs leaving his astonished co-workers behind

No one can run through the woods faster than Logan andLogan
has never needed to run faster He vaults fallen trees

under branches accelerates when he hits the access road

EXT ACCESS ROAD - MINUTES LATER

Logan sees the pickup truck in the distance Even a hundred

yards away he can tell that something iswrong

It seems impossible that he could run any faster but now he
does reaching the truck in seconds He sees the claw marks

gouged through the steel hood

He seesthe drivers side door tossed onto the asphalt

yards from the truck

And finally he sees Kayla curled in the fetal position on
the side of the access road Blood puddles beneath her Her
skin has already begun to lose its color

He runs to her kneels beside her body hands checking for a
pulse listening for breath trying desperately to find any
sign of life in her lifeless form

LOGAN

Come on youre okay Say
something Say something darling
Say something Kayla come on

He cradles her in his arms

He rocks back and forth her lifeless body clutched tightly
in his arms his eyes clenched shut

The veins bulge in his neck every muscle in his body

as if there were a beast inside him trying to break free of
his skin

INT CASADYS BAR and GRILL - DAY

The local dive opens early TOWN DRUNKS sit by themselves
smoking cigarettes sipping the days first hair-of--the-

reading the paper or staring into their beer

Victor Creed sits at the bar carving a crude smiley face
into the wood with the claw of his index finger He looks up
and sees the BARTENDER staring at him The bartender doesnt
approve of the vandalism but hes not about to say

Creed taps the rim of his glass The bartender comes over
with a bottle of George Dickel Tennessee whiskey He fills
Creeds glass halfway-- a standard pour

Creed stares at the bartender He taps the glass again The
bartender hand shaking fills the glass to the brim

Creed raises the whiskey to the light

VICTOR CREED

Stuff dont work on me I drink and

drink and I never feel any

different

He downs the full glass of whiskey with a swallow He looks
around the bar at the pool table in the back the Wurlitzer

Creed wipes his mouth with the back of his hand

VICTOR CREED

Logan walks into the tavern sniffing the air He sees Creed
sitting on the barstool back to the door

( CONTTNTTFT) I

Logan approaches the bar never taking his eyes off creed
Finally Creed turns to look at Logan He stands towering
above the smaller man

Logan sees a splotch of dried blood on the back of Creeds
hand Creed knows Logan is looking at it He lifts his hand
to his mouth and licks the blood off

VICTOR CREED (contd)

Sweet girl Tasted like strawberry

jam

The bone claws burst from Logans hands pale white and
serrated He growls and swings at Creeds head

The big man is fast He ducks under the claws grinning and
circling like a boxer happy that hes finally got a decent
adversary

The bartender and the local drunks have seen plenty of bar
fights but not ones featuring clawed mutants They run
VICTOR CREED (contd)

You can scare off the civilians

with those sonny boy But I got

claws of my own

He swings raking his talons across Logans chest drawing
first blood Logan lunges at Creed and the battle begins
-The pace of the combat is startling the physical power
stupendous A missed swipe by Creed ends with him clawing

the guts of the jukebox Logan jumps at his enemy and gets

through the snow toward the distant woods

where the virgin snow glitters beneath the moon

He stops moving and peers through the darkness He smells
something coming closer

as he nears a closed doorway He rests his head against the

entering the room

INT STRYKERS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Stryker sits behind his desk smiling at Logan But Logans
not looking at the colonel Hes looking at the young woman
who sits across from Stryker her back to the door

She doesnt turn Her long black hair cascades down her

STRYKER

Hello old friend Weve been

waiting for you

Logan walks toward the desk slowly now aman ina

he cant wake from

STRYKER (contd)

Did you really think we just let

you walk away three years ago

Youre a dangerous man my friend

We like to keep an eye on dangerous

When Logan reaches the young woman he puts his hand on her
shoulder

Kayla Silverfox turns and stares up at him tears streaming
down her face

An aluminum baseball bat whirs through the air smashing the

carries Logan out of the room winking at Kayla

INT RE-EDUCATION CHAMBER ALKALI LAKE - DAY

Logan still unconscious sits on a chair that looks far too
similar to an electric chair his arms and legs bound with
titanium manacles that prevent any movement

The room looks like an execution chamber complete with a
viewing window

He opens his eyes and blinks in the bright light Stryker

Creed stand in front of him but Logan doesnt look at them
Dr Cornelius and an ASSISTANT stand near a machine that is
wired to the electric chair fiddling with the controls but
Logan doesnt look at them either

He stares at Kayla who cannot meet his eyes

LOGAN

Kayla head bowed is silent for a long count When she
speaks her voice is a strange monotone devoid of feeling

toward her black talons raking five gashes on the hood
ayla has been expecting him She pulls her backpack out

behind the seat and takes from it a hypodermic needle anda
plastic IV bag filled with dark blood

Creed tears the trucks door off its hinges and tosses it
twenty yards Kayla injects herself with the hypodermic

Kayla hops down from the truck She holds out the IV bag to
Victor who casually pierces it with his claw

KAYLA (V0) (contd)
Id been drawing my own blood every

night for the past week I had four

Kayla smears her own blood on her body and empties the rest
of the bag on the pavement She lies down in the puddle in a

Kayla finally raises her head-and looks directly at Logan

KAYLA

Shot my Daddy when I was eighteen
Big mistake Should have shot him
when I was seventeen

LOGAN
You told me he died of a heart
attack

KAYLA

Maybe he had a heart attack after I
shot him Sat there and watched him
bleed After what that man did to
me I wish he died slower

Logan stares at her for a long time
KAYLA (contd)

That sweet little girl you lived
with in the cabin That was all

Kayla blinks and looks away

Everybodys a sucker for something

Figuring out what it is thats the

trick For you its a womans

But still a weakness

Stryker signals to Cornelius The doctor and his assistant
attach a nasty-looking copper halo to Logans skull The

is wired to the electric chair

Logan never takes his eyes off Silverfox

STRYKER (contd)

Dont be angry at her She was just

serving her country keeping the

mutant menace in check She and

victor have been a real credit to

their race

It takes Logan a moment to understand this comment

LOGAN
Youre a mutant

KAYLA

My Daddy found out when I was
twelve Said a freak like me
deserved whatever I got
it

VICTOR CREED
My kind of guy

STRYKER

Shes a gifted girl She can plant

thoughts in anyones mind make

them believe what she wants-- as

long as she stays focused on them

He strokes her long dark hair proud of his protege Kayla
doesnt seem thrilled by Strykers touch but she endures

STRYKER (contd)
A useful tool in a seduction

KAYLA

(to Logan)

Spent so much time getting you to
love me by the time the Colonel
showed up I couldnt get you to
leave me

Stryker exits the room followed by Victor

Kayla is silent for a moment

My mother told me that story
She takes a deep breath and turns to go

It doesnt matter You wont

remember any of this

You didnt trick me into loving
you

KAYLA

LOGAN

The last two months you werent
playing around in my skull You

Kayla lowers her eyes

KAYLA
You dont know where I come from
You dont know what it was like

LOGAN
I know exactly what is was like I
come from there too

in

a sardonic smile

She unfastens the titanium manacles Logan is still
unconscious Kayla shakes him gently

against the wall He tries to skewer Creed with the claws of
his right hand but Creed moves his head at the last moment
Logans claws are buried to the hilt-in the wall He strikes
at Creed with his left hand but Creed dodges again All six
of Logans claws are deep in the solid rock wall

He brings his hands together the adamantium blades slicing
through granite as if it were cheesecake

Creed ducks under the claws an instant before they shred

He grabs Logan in a-bear hug

unable to halt their momentum Logan and Creed tumble

the fall Creed tears into the smaller man mercilessly
slinging him around the cavern gouging him with his black

Creed batters Logan with a series of savage blows Logan

Creed plants one heavy black boot on Logans face and

presses
down hard He leers at his defeated foe

exerts pressure on the remaining weight-bearing supports
Most of the ten thousand cant get close to Logan but they
all want in on the first kill

Even Logan cant hold back the tide for long Talons rake

face his arms his chest But still he battles slicing
through a fourth pillar a fifth

Tremendous fissures split the rock ceiling Dust and rocks
fall onto the cavern floor as the fissures widen

Logan sees that the caverns collapse is imminent He can no
longer hold off the Elevens assault

An instant before the clones can shred him he jumps using
his claws to scale one of the still-standing steel pillars
with the grace and speed of a leopard climbing a tree

One of the clones follows using his black talons in the

fashion grabbing at Logans feet
When Logan is forty feet above the throng of teeth-gnashing
clones he severs the pillar below his feet The clone

chasing him can climb no farther can do nothing but roar

hiss at his escaping prey

Logan swings himself onto the steel staircase where Kayla
waits beside the open door He races up the stairs
Stryker sees his dream in ruins He runs for the nearest
exit

when the cavern ceiling gives out Thousands of tons of

Logan grabs Kayla and hauls her to safety an instant before
she would be crushed

falling into the massive pit created by the caverns
collapse

Severed gas lines and ruptured boilers have turned the

A few dazed survivors SOLDIERS and SCIENTISTS have escaped
the carnage but Alkali Lake no longer exists as a military
base Thousands of singed documents flutter in the wind
Logan and Kayla walk away from the burning crater never
looking back They head through the woods toward the lake
that glitters in the sunlight
