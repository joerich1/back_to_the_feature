CITY SKYLINE —- NIGHT (CIRCA 1958)
Lights twinkle Snow falls The WIND MOANS
After a beat the voice of an elderly black man
NARRATOR (VO)
Thes right New York
We are TRACKING HIGH THROUGH the night sky From the
streets
far below we hear the sounds of TRAFFIC muffled by the
falling
snow and the DISTANT sound of many VOICES SINGING
We are DRIFTING AMONG the buildings the tops of
skyscrapers
slip by left and right
NARRATOR (VO)
Its 1958 -- anyway for a few mo
minutes it is Come midnight its
gonna be 1959 A whole nother

Auld Lang Syne
NARRATOR (VO)
Yeah ole daddy Earth fixin to

We are MOVING IN TOWARDS a particular skyscraper At its

NARRATOR (VO)

We hear a SERIES OF POPPING sounds

NARRATOR (VO)
All over town champagne corks is

A big band WALTZ MIXES UP on the track

NARRATOR (VO)
Over in the Waldorf the big shots
is dancin to the strains of Guy
Lombardo Down in Times Square the
little folks is a-watchin and a-—
waitin fo that big ball to drop

The LOMBARDO MUSIC gives way to the CHANTING of a distant
CROWD Sixty Fifty-nine Fifty-eight

NARRATOR (VO)
-They all tryin to catch holt a
one moment of time

The CHANTING has MIXED back DOWN AGAIN TO leave only the
WIND Still TRACKING IN TOWARD the top of the skyscraper

begin to hear the TICK of its enormous CLOCK The clock

a minute to twelve Above it in neon a companys name
HUDSUCKER INDUSTRIES Below it in neon the companys
motto THE FUTURE IS NOW

NARRATOR (VO)
to be able to say -- Right now
This is it I got it Course by
then itll be past
(more cheerfully)
But they all happy evvybody havin
a good time

We are MOVING IN ON a darkened penthouse window next to
clock The window starts to open
NARRATOR (VO)
Well almost evvybody Theys a
few lost souls floatin ‘round out

there

A young man is crawling out of the window onto the ledge
With the opening of the window AULD LANG SYNE filters

with greater volume

NARRATOR (VO)
This ones Norville Barnes

The man gingerly straightens up on the ledge He is

in his late twenties He wears a leather apron Printed
the apron HUDSUCKER MAIL ROOMThe Future is Now
He looks with nervous determination into the void

NARRATOR (VO)
Lets move in for a closer look

The CAMERA obliges We TRACK IN SLOWLY ENDING VERY
CLOSE

NARRATOR (VO)
That office he jes stepped out of
is the office of the president of
Hudsucker Industries Its his
office

Norville sways in anguish as the TICKING of the CLOCK

grows
louder and the WIND blows in his face

NARRATOR (VO)
Howd he get so high An why is
he feelin so low Is he really gonna
do it -- is Norville really gonna
jelly up the sidewalk

Norville is tensing his body peering out over the ledge
preparing to make a swan dive into oblivion -- but the
CAMERAS continued MOVEMENT is LOSING him FROM FRAME

We are MOVING IN ON the enormous CLOCK whose MECHANICAL

THRUM becomes very loud indeed

NARRATOR (VO)
Well the future thats something
you cant never tell about

The second hand of the clock is nearing the twelve --

bare

seconds to midnight Distant CHANTING from Times Square

MIXES
UP Nine Eight Seven

But the past Thats another
story

The sign is over a ground floor office an exterior clock
shows 900 A curtain is just being pulled open in its

window to reveal a great job board It is like the
board in a great train station with each of its

entries flipping over occasionally to reveal a new
opportunity On offer are jobs like PASTRY CHEF

LAY-OUT MAN GRAVEDIGGER etc

REVERSE

On the small crowd gathered to like Norville watch the
board -- men in search of jobs of various classes and
vocations but alike in their intent gaze their hands
into their pockets their hats pushed back on their

bobbing occasionally to get a better view of the

board Men occasionally head for the office as they see a
prospect they like

deliberately and rubs his palms together

He swings his chair out

He steps up onto the chair

The board stares

He steps up from the chair onto the board table

The heads of the board members swing up in unison

Hudsucker is FRAMED FROM MID-TORSO DOWN He shakes the

DISSOLVE THROUGH

TO

EXT TOP FLOOR

With the LAST TOLL of the CLOCK punctuating the CUT we
are

FLOATING IN TOWARDS the shattered board room window

The womans SCREAM on the street below is FAINT ECHOING

MIXING INTO the sound of an APPROACHING SIREN

THROUGH the window we see the BOARD MEMBERS still sitting

around the table paralyzed in attitudes of horror and

disbelief All stare at the shattered window in the fg

At the far end of the table Hudsuckers chair is empty
and

oddly askew His cigar still smokes in its ashtray

There are dust footprints down the middle of the long oak

table

One Executive sits with a pluming cigarette held halfway
to

his mouth another holds a carafe suspended on its way to
his water glass another holds his spectacles inches from
his nose

We hear only the HUM of the HUDSUCKER CLOCK

SID MUSSBURGER ENTERS FRAME at the window He is a tall
middle-
aged executive with lean and rugged good looks and a
commanding presence

He knocks a last piece of glass out of the sill with his
knuckle looks out grunts and draws his head back in

The CAMERA FOLLOWS him INTO the room The other board
members

heads swivel to watch him all staring searching
desperately

for some hint as to the fate of their fallen leader

Apparently some absurd hope still lingers

Mussburger perches on the board table by his own chair

He reaches over to pluck the smoking cigar from the
suicides
ashtray

MUSSBURGER
Pity to waste a whole Monte Cristo

The other board members unfreeze their worst fears
confirmed

AN EXECUTIVE
He couldve opened the window

ELDERLY EXECUTIVE
Waring Hudsucker never did anything
the easy way

ADDISON
My God why Why did he do it
Things were going so well

MUSSBURGER
What am I a headshrinker Maybe the
man was unhappy

ADDISON
He didnt look unhappy

EXECUTIVE
Yeah well he didnt look rich

ELDERY EXECUTIVE
Waring Hudsucker was never an easy
man to figure out
(reminiscing)
He built this company with his bare
hands Every step he took was a step
up Except of course this last one

MUSSBURGER
Sure sure he was a swell guy but
when the president chairman of the
board and holder of eighty-seven
percent of the companys stock drops
forty-four floors -—-
PRECISE EXECUTIVE
Forty-five --

ELDERY EXECUTIVE
Counting the mezzanine --—

MUSSBURGER
-—- Then the company has a problem
Stillson what exactly is the
disposition of Warings stock

STILLSON
Well as you know Hud left no will
and had no family The company bylaws
are quite clear in that event His
entire portfolio will be converted
to common stock and will be sold
over the counter as of the first of
the fiscal year following his demise

MUSSBURGER
Meaning

STILLSON
Meaning simply that Warings stock
and control of the company will be
available to the public on January
first

MUSSBURGER
You mean to tell me that any slob in
a smelly T-shirt will be able to buy
Hudsucker stock

Stillson shrugs

STILLSON
The company bylaws are quite clear

ADDISON
My God Youre animals How can you
discuss his stock when the man has
just leapt forty-five floors --

PRECISE EXECUTIVE
Forty-four —-

ELDERLY EXECUTIVE
-- Not counting the mezzanine

MUSSBURGER
Quit showboating Addison the man
is gone The question now is whether
were going to let John Q Public
waltz in and buy 87 percent of our
company

PIPE-SMOKING EXECUTIVE
Whatre you suggesting Sidney
Certainly we cant afford to buy a
controlling interest

MUSSBURGER
Not while the stock is this strong
How long before Huds paper hits the
market

STILLSON
January first

AN EXECUTIVE
Thirty days

ANOTHER EXECUTIVE
Four weeks

ADDISON
A month at the most

MUSSBURGER
One month to make the blue-chip
investment of the century look like
a round-trip ticket on the Titanic

AN EXECUTIVE
We play up the fact that Hud is dead

ALL
(in unison)
Long live the Hud

ANOTHER EXECUTIVE
We depress the stock --

YET ANOTHER EXECUTIVE
-- to the point where we can buy
fifty-percent

PRECISE EXECUTIVE
Fifty-one

ELDERLY EXECUTIVE
Not counting the mezzanine

CAUTIOUS EXECUTIVE
It could work

OPTIMISTIC EXECUTIVE
It should work

PRACTICAL EXECUTIVE
It would work

MUSSBURGER
(at ticker tape machine)
Its working already Waring Hudsucker
is abstract art on Madison Avenue
All we need now is a new president
who will inspire real panic in our
stockholders
ENTHUSIASTIC EXECUTIVE
Yeah a puppet

ANOTHER EXECUTIVE
A proxy

YET ANOTHER EXECUTIVE
A pawn

Mussburger strides across the room from the still
CHATTERING

TICKER TAPE MACHINE and lowers himself into Waring
Hudsuckers

chair He takes a last puff from his cigar and slowly
exhales

a cloud of smoke

MUSSBURGER
Sure sure Some jerk we can really

BUZZ
(hissing)
Good luck buddy
The door sweeps shut Norville looks nervously around

Behind him the elevator doors suddenly open again

BUZZ
-- Youll need it

The elevator doors slam shut and we hear its ENGINES
as it power-dives away

Norville turns toward the executive offices

Plush thick-carpeted silence

Norville starts walking

A SCRAPING SOUND stands out in the high-powered executive
quiet Norville looks to one side

A workman in painters overalls squats in front of a pair
heavy oak doors With a razor blade he is scraping off
name “WARING HUDSUCKER

NORVILLE
Mr Mussburgers office

The scraper looks sullenly over his shoulder at Norville
With a jerk of his thumb he indicates the direction
Norville enters the adjacent office

OUTER OFFICE

Two secretaries are in Mussburgers outer reception

The first is a filing secretary who stands frozen in the
fg her hand poised over an open drawer to deposit a

as she stares at Norville with an amused and supercilious
sneer which stays pasted on throughout
The second secretary -- the RECEPTIONIST -- is seated
behind

a desk in the bg that flanks the door to Mussburgers

private office The Receptionist sits with her hands
clasped

on the desk staring at Norville with the hunch-
shouldered

down-from-under look of a patient vulture

RECEPTIONIST
Do you have an appointment

NORVILLE
Uhh no I --

The filing secretary sneers

RECEPTIONIST
Shall we look in the book hmmmmmmmmm

She opens an enormous leather-bound book with yellowed
crinkly
pages
NORVILLE

A low unearthly WAIL fills the room the sound of a
million
souls moaning in purgatory
The Receptionist looks up

The blackness and the wailing are both cut short by the
of a DOOR OPENING We are

INT MUSSBURGERS OFFICE

its door swinging open to admit Norville

In the bg in the outer office we can see the filing
secretary leaning back motionless in a chair with a damp

draped across her forehead The Receptionist is fanning
with a towel
The door closes behind Norville

We hear a rhythmic CLICK-CLICK-CLICK and the HUM of
VENTILATION

NORVILLES POV

Across miles of carpet is a huge executive desk behind
is a large executive chair facing the window From above
back of the chair cigar smoke wreathes up A telephone
snakes around to the man sitting in the chair hidden

us On the desktop is a perpetual motion machine of large
swinging ball bearings Click-click-click

A TICKERTAPE MACHINE occasionally BURPS information in
far corner of the office

A huge MECHANICAL ARM -- the sweep second hand of the
Hudsucker clock on the facade of the building -- RUMBLES

immediately outside the window describing an arc that
a moving shadow across the office
His BACK TO us into the phone
MUSSBURGER
-- Sure sure Parkinsons stupid but
hes ambitious too hard to control
He swivels around to face Norville who stands

at the door Still listening at the phone Mussburger

Norville forward
MUSSBURGER

He covers the mouth piece

MUSSBURGER

Norville)
This better be good Im in a bad
mood

Norville clears his throat

NORVILLE
Well sir Ive got something for
you from the mailroom but first if
I could just take a minute or so
from your very busy time

He reaches into his mailroom apron and hands a scrap of

across the desk to Mussburger who stares frozen at
Norville making no move to take the paper

NORVILLE
to show you a uh

Norville undaunted holds up the paper since Mussburger
will not take it Mussburger doesnt even look at it his
eyes are locked on Norvilles Mussburger smolders

NORVILLE
-a little something Ive been
working on for the last two or three
years
Mussburgers burning eyes finally shift momentarily to

at the crudely drawn circle he looks back incredulously

Norville
NORVILLE
You know for kids Which is
perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I

claim to be any great genius like
they say inspiration is 99 percent
perspiration and in my case Id say
its at least twice that but I gotta
tell ya Mr Mussburger sir this
desk

that

chair

sweet baby --

MUSSBURGER
Wait a minute

Sudden quiet

With one last click the perpetual motion ball bearings
abruptly stop

As Mussburgers eyes burn in on him Norville stands mute
and paralyzed

His eyes locked on Norvilles Mussburger circles the

He stands toe-to-toe with Norville

He thrusts his face into Norvilles whose head moves

reflexively back Mussburgers nose is almost touching
Norvilles his eyes are burning searching studying
evaluating

Finally he draws his head back

MUSSBURGER
Hmmm

With one hand he thrusts his cigar into Norvilles gaping
mouth With his other hand he raises Norvilles chin so

his teeth clench it

MUSSBURGER
Umm-hmm

He steps back eyes still on Norville
He jerks his thumb over his shoulder indicating his
behind the desk

MUSSBURGER
Siddown

Norville his lips puckered around the unaccustomed
looks bemusedly from the chair to Mussburger

MUSSBURGER
»Go ahead Try it on

Norville obeys reluctantly stiffly

MUSSBURGER
Put your feet up

Norville is again reluctant

MUSSBURGER
Go ahead
Norville obeys Mussburger studies

MUSSBURGER
Hmmmm Lets get to know one
another shall we

Norvilles eyes squint against the cigar smoke wreathing
from between his teeth Mussburger seems to relax

MUSSBURGER
Lets chat
(beams)
-Man to man

Norville beams

MUSSBURGER
You werent blessed with much

He waves vaguely towards his head and searches for a
euphemism

MUSSBURGER
education were you

NORVILLE
Well Im a college graduate --

MUSSBURGER
All right but you didnt excel in
your studies

NORVILLE
Well I made the deans list

MUSSBURGER
(worried)
Hmmm

Norville sputters out some more cigar smoke

NORVILLE
At the Muncie College of Business
Administration

MUSSBURGER

NORVILLE
But sir --

MUSSBURGER
Get your feet off that desk

As he struggles to comply

NORVILLE
But --

MUSSBURGER
Get out of my sight

Norville squinting against the cigar smoke pulls the
out of his mouth as he doubles forward feet still up
for a place to set down the cigar He sets it blindly on
loose stack of papers

MUSSBURGER
My God The Bumstead contracts

NORVILLE
Oh my God sir

The top page radiates a circle of incipient flame from
cigars live end
MUSSBURGER
You nitwit I worked for three years

on this deal

NORVILLE
Oh my God sir

Norville runs across the office to a large water cooler

MUSSBURGER
Ill take care of it Just get out

into a wastebasket He pats the fingertips of one hand

At the other end of the office Norville is wrapping his
arms around the glass water tank which he pulls off its
base He runs back across the vast expanse of office

the desk hugging the water tank whose WATER GLOOB-GLOOBS
out its open bottom and splashes down onto his pumping

As he reaches the desk the near-empty tank is now light
enough for him to hoist with one arm which he does and
cups his other hand under it to catch its last glub of
He tosses the TANK to the floor where --
CRASH -- it SHATTERS and stands looking about for a
to dump his handful of water
MUSSBURGER
Why you nitwit You almost destroyed

the most sensitive deal of my career

NORVILLE
Oh my God sir

He is reacting to the wastebasket on his side of the
which Mussburger cannot see

It is sprouting flame at which Norville ineffectually
his remaining drops of water

MUSSBURGER
Now out of here Out

Norville is already running to the window which he runs
both palms over desperately seeking a way to open it

MUSSBURGER
Not that way Through the door

NORVILLE
But sir

The windows do not open Norville furiously stomps on the
flames in the wastebasket and -- his foot sticks

Further stomping only makes the flaming wastebasket roar
and down with his foot

MUSSBURGER
Right away buster Out of my office

Norville has dropped to the floor trying to wrench the
flaming wastebasket off his leg

MUSSBURGER

Up on your feet We dont crawl at

NORVILLE
Sir my leg is on fire

Norville finally succeeds in getting the flaming
off his foot Now the problem is what to do with it
MUSSBURGER
Get out of this office you dithering
nincompoop

Norville picks up the flaming trash receptacle

NORVILLE
Oh my God sir

He winds up and throws it through the closed window

The GLASS SHATTERS and the flaming basket plummets to
oblivion

With the picture window broken a FEROCIOUS DRAFT ROARS
the penthouse office

CLOSE SHOT - BUMSTEAD CONTRACTS

On the desk The pages are sucked away by the draft

MUSSBURGER
My God The Bumstead contracts

NORVILLE

Mussburger lunges for the contracts as they are sucked

around one wafting page -- he is about to fall --

the expert but at the Muncie College
of Business Administration they told

Mussburger gives an artificially hearty laugh and claps
Norville on the shoulder

MUSSBURGER
Relax Norville Its only natural
in a period of transition for the
more nervous element to run for cover
keep

behind

NORVILLE
Okay Sid Like I said youre the
expert but --

EXT SIDEWALK
Norville is still loping behind Mussburger trying
up with his long strides

NORVILLE

fire to your off -- uh the day I
was promoted

MUSSBURGER
I do remember and I was impressed
Anyway thats all forgotten now
Driver

NORVILLE
Thank you Sid but the reason I
mention it is it would require such
a small capital investment -- again
youre the expert here --

MUSSBURGER
Damnit wheres my car

NORVILLE
-- But theres such an enormous
potential profit-wise given the
demographics -- baby boom --
discretionary income in the burgeoning
middle class --

A black limousine pulls up to the curb

MUSSBURGER
Finally

NORVILLE
-- So if you think its appropriate
Id like to bounce the idea off a
few people at lunch --
Mussburger is getting into the back seat --

MUSSBURGER

INT COFFEE SHOP
A cheap coffee shop a half-flight down from the street
We are LOOKING ACROSS an elbow of the coffee shop
counter
In the middle bg Norville sits dejectedly stirring a
cup
of coffee
Behind him THROUGH the window wells we see the back and
forth feet of pedestrians bustling by on the sidewalk
In the extreme fg sit two steaming mugs of coffee
They belong to two VETERANS of the coffee shop who from
OS narrate the scene

from the street and hesitates by the door looking
around
Still attractive but looking somewhat down-at-the-heels
it

VETERAN 1 (0S)

The womans eyes settle on Norville and she heads for

the
empty stool next to his
VETERAN 2 (0S)
She finds him
VETERAN 1 (0S)
She sits down
The woman says something to the counter waitress who

VETERAN 2 (0S)

VETERAN 1 (0S)
She looks in her purse

She is holding her wallet upside down

VETERAN 2 (0S)
No money

VETERAN 1 (0S)
The mark notices

Beat Norville however is not noticing He is staring
intently at his coffee spoon his hat pushed back on his
head his other hand propping up a cheekbone the womans
presence does not seem to have registered yet

VETERAN 2 (0S)
-Hes not noticing Benny

VETERAN 1 (0S)

As the woman cries she accidentally-on-purpose jostles
Norville and he finally does indeed notice

VETERAN 2 (0S)

The woman mouths words at Norville who reacts
sympathetically
and waves his hands at the waitress

VETERAN 1 (0S)
She explains her perdicament and

VETERAN 1 and 2 (0OS)
(in unison)
-entuh the light lunch

The waitress is entering to set a plate in front of the

Her mother needs an operation
VETERAN 2 (0S)

Norville is rising to his feet

VETERAN 2 (0S)

VETERAN 1 (0S)

VETERAN 2 (0S)

INT NORVILLES OFFICE

Looking at its frosted-glass door the sign painter is
just
finishing lettering in NORVILLE BARNES President

The sign painter makes way as we see Norvilles shadow

approaching even from inside the room we can hear that
he

is WHEEZING HEAVILY He is apparently carrying the girl

cradled in his arms He tries to reach down to get the

doorknob cant manage it turns to press his back
against

the door and get the knob with his other hand

The door opens as Norville swings around to enter He is
wheezing like a gas pipe about to explode

He swings around to kick the door shut We see that the

lettering on the door is now terribly smudged we also
see

in wet ink on the seat of Norvilles pants senraB
ellivroN

tnediserP

Weakly still cradled in Norvilles arms

AMY
Im sorry we had to take the stairs
It was just that horrible little
elevator boy

NORVILLE
Not at all Youre light as a feather

AMY
(pointing languorously)
The couch please

Still wheezing horribly Norville staggers over to the
couch

and deposits her gently on it He straightens up and
looks

at her

NORVILLES POV

She is smiling wanly AT the CAMERA The entire IMAGE
PULSATES
as the blood pounds behind Norvilles eyeballs

We hear the LOUD RASPING of his BREATH resonating
inside

his head Amy is talking but her voice is barely audible
as

if coming from a long way away

BACK TO SCENE

NORVILLE
Just a minute

He perches drunkenly on the edge of the couch and puts
his
head between his knees still fighting for breath

AMY
I dont know what came over me I
suppose it was the shock of eating
after so long without the enzymes
kicking in after so long or whatever
But then you couldnt possibly know
what it is to be tired and hungry

Speaking into his knees as he wheezes

NORVILLE
Hungry anyway

AMY
I dont want to bore you with all
the sordid details of my life its
not a happy story

Norville rises and starts putting throw pillows behind
her
head

AMY
Suffice it to say that Im jobless --
though not for want of trying that
Im friendless with no one to --
thank you -- take care of me and
that had you not come along at just
exactly the moment that you did --

She screams staring down at the couch

Norville jumps startled then looks where she is
looking

On the white sofa cushion where he had been sitting is
printed in wet ink right side around NORVILLE BARNES
President

AMY
Norville I didnt know you were
president here

Norville stares dumbfounded at the sofa cushion When the

nickel finally drops he spins around to try to look at
the

seat of his pants

Distracted but still modest
NORVILLE
Oh its nothing really Just

determination and hard work

He unbuckles his trousers
NORVILLE
Of course when I started in the
mailroom last Tuesday I thought it
might take more time —-

Buzz enters holding a brown paper bag
BUZZ
Say buddy heres the whiskey you
asked ff --

He freezes taking in the scene Amy reclining on the

couch
Norville standing in front of her with his pants around
his
ankles still breathing heavily the bottle of whiskey in
his own hand
NORVILLE
(flustered)
Thank you Buzz just leave it on
the desk
Leering
BUZZ
Happy days buddy
As he turns to leave
BUZZ
-and Ill tell your secretary youre
not to be disturbed Yowzuh
He snaps the elastic strap under his chin
After the doors shut behind Buzz
AMY
(shuddering)
What a horrible little person
NORVILLE
Oh Buzz is pretty harmless really --
AMY
At any rate I arrived in town not
ten days ago full of dreams and
aspirations anxious to make my way
in the world --
Norville pours a glass of whiskey and brings it over to
her
AMY
A little naive perhaps but -- thank
you -- armed with determination a

solid work ethic and an indomitable
belief in the future --
NORVILLE
I myself --

He crosses back to the desk

AMY
Only to have that belief that
unsullied optimism dashed against
the marble and mortar of the modern
work place —-

Norville takes a cigarette from a large wood cigarette

box
on the desk and sticks it in his mouth
NORVILLE
Cigarette
AMY
No thank you Seek and ye shall find
work and ye shall prosper -- these
were the watch words of my education
the ethics of my tender years --
OVER NORVILLES SHOULDER
He has been pushing the box towards her The box tilts
lazily
forward and then disappears over the far lip of the desk
We
hear the THUD of the BOX landing amid the pitter-patter
of
cigarettes raining onto the carpet
Amys brow crinkles Continuing
AMY
-- these were the values that were
instilled in me while I was growing
up in a little town youve probably
never heard of --
NORVILLE
Mind if I join you
He is pouring himself a drink
AMY
Be my guest A little town youve
probably --
He tosses back his drink gags looks at Amy with his
eyes
bulging
HIS POV
Once again her IMAGE PULSATES There is a ROARING SOUND
and

an AIRY STEAM WHISTLE as she silently moves her lips
NORVILLE
He waves his arms and talks with a
thick rasp as he staggers to his

feet

NORVILLE
Excuse me -- I -—- executive
washroom

He staggers out a side door

On his exit Amy leaps to her feet and scurries over to

his
desk At the top of her voice
AMY
Are you all right
She throws open the top desk drawer Inside two lonely
lead
pencils roll through the otherwise empty drawer
Amy expertly flips a cigarette into her mouth and strikes
a
match off the desktop
AMY
Is it your lunch The chicken a
la king
From the washroom
NORVILLE (0S)
No I --
Amy throws open another drawer empty except for an
appointment book As she hurriedly flips through page
after
blank page an arctic WIND WHISTLES emptiness One page
only
has a notation 1145 Address Wilkie Grammar School
Junior

Achievers Club

AMY
Is the a la king repeating on you

Amy shoves the appointment book back into the drawer

NORVILLE (0S)

Im fine I You were saying
She mutters
AMY
Values watchwords uh tender
years
(aloud)

-- A little town youve probably
never heard of
BEING

last

quickly

of

She hastily stubs out her cigarette and waves her hand to
disperse the smoke

AMY
Muncie Indiana

She scurries back across the room as we hear the FAUCET

TURNED OFF she re-strikes her languid pose on the couch
just as the washroom door opens

Norville gapes one hand pressing a dripping rag to his
forehead

NORVILLE
Youre from Muncie

AMY
Why yes do you know it

Norville starts making pumping motions with his fists and
loud syncopated grunting noises Amy gapes at him

He starts singing off-key

NORVILLE
Fight on fight on dear old Muncie
Fight on -- Hoist the gold and blue

Youll be tattered torn and hurtin
Once The Munce is done with you

Amy lamely fakes singing along coming in louder on the
obvious rhyme Norville jumps an octave on it she
follows sit also pumping her fists

As Norville crosses his hands and locks thumbs in front
his nose to make bird wings of his extended fingers

NORVILLE
Gooo000000 Eagles

Amy awkwardly imitates
Norville excitedly sits behind his desk

NORVILLE
-A Muncie girl Talk about the
cats pyjamas Tell you what Amy
Im gonna cancel the rest of my
appointments this afternoon and get
you a job here at the Hud

AMY
Oh no really I --

NORVILLE

He hits the intercom

NORVILLE
-Mail room

NORVILLE
-Thisll only take a moment

NORVILLE
Oh of all the foolish Listen do

Norville excitedly smacks a fist into a palm

NORVILLE
-- A Muncie girl Can you beat that

AMY
Well I just dont know how to thank

NORVILLE
Please Norville

As he reaches to shake

NORVILLE
Its my pleasure

She reaches for his hand but Norville snatches it away

and
winking at her hooks thumbs in front of his nose and
makes
wings of his fingers
NORVILLE
Goooo000o Eagles
AMY
likewise hooks her thumbs in front of her nose makes
wings

Muttering to himself

NORVILLE

Amy is bustling in holding a steno pad and a pencil

As she seats herself in front of his desk he rises to
pace
behind it

NORVILLE
Did you happen to see the front
page of todays Manhattan Argus

AMY
Well I didnt bother to read the
article I didnt think the picture
did you justice

NORVILLE
The picture was fine Its what that
knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath
Of all the irresponsible Amy
take this down Dear Miss Archer I
call you Miss because you seem to
have missed the boat completely on
this one How on earth would you
know whether Im an imbecile when
you dont even have the guts to come
in here and interview me man to man
No change guts to courage No
make it common decency These wild
speculations about my intelligence --

He whips the cover sheet off a display pad resting on an
easel to reveal a large piece of graph paper with a

AMY

NORVILLE

(nodding)
-- these preposterous inventions
would be better suited to the pages
of Amazing Tales Magazine If the
editors of the Manhattan Argus see
fit to publish the rantings of a
disordered mind perhaps they will
see fit to publish this letter But
I doubt it I most seriously doubt
it As I doubt also that you could
find a home at Amazing Tales a
periodical which I have enjoyed for
many years Yours sincerely et
cetera

into thought

AMY
Is that all Mr Barnes

NORVILLE
Well you know me Amy at least
better than that that dame does Do
you think Im an imbecile

AMY
Im sure I --

NORVILLE
Go on tell the truth I trust you
and I put a lot of stock in your
opinion

AMY
Well I --
NORVILLE
Oh sure youre biased -- youre a

fellow Muncian But would an imbecile
come up with this

rendered onto it

Amy looks

puzzled from the circle to Norvilles proudly

beaming face

NORVILLE
I designed it myself and this is
just the sweet baby that can put
Hudsucker right back on top

Amy is bewildered Norville explains

NORVILLE
-You know For kids

AMY
Why dont I just type this up

NORVILLE
Aww naw Amy that wont be
necessary I shouldnt send it shes
just doing her job I guess

AMY
Well I dont know maybe she does
deserve it Maybe she shouldve come
in to face you man to man

NORVILLE
Well she probably had a deadline

AMY
Sure but -- she could still have
gotten your side for the record

NORVILLE
Well its done now -- whats the
use of grousing about it Forget the
letter Amy I just had to blow off
some steam

She gets up to leave and is heading for the door when
Norville adds

NORVILLE
Shes probably just a little
confused

Amy turns at the door

AMY
Confused

NORVILLE
Yeah you know probably one of these
fast-talking career gals thinks
shes one of the boys Probably is
one of the boys if you know what I
mean

AMY
(through clenched
teeth)
Im quite sure I dont know what you
mean

NORVILLE
Yeah you know Suffers from one of
these complexes they have nowadays
Seems pretty obvious doesnt it
Shes probably very unattractive and
bitter about it

He stares

Oh is that it

and hobnobs with some smooth talking

Smoocher or

AMY
Smitty

NORVILLE
Exactly And I bet shes ugly
Real ugly Otherwise why wouldnt
they print her picture next to her
byline

AMY
Maybe she puts her work ahead of her
personal appearance

NORVILLE

I bet thats exactly what she tells
herself But you and I both know
shes just a dried-up bitter old
maid Say how about you and I grab
a little dinner and a show after
work I was thinking maybe The King

As Norvilles hand drops from his breast pocket the

stoops BELOW FRAME to retrieve the hanky

AMY

Oh Nothing really just the

NORVILLE

AMY
Let me hold it or youll have a

NORVILLE
Thanks People seem to be pretty hot
over this imbecile story

AMY
Im sorry

NORVILLE
Oh it isnt your fault Amy
Youre the one person whos been
standing by me through all this

As she rolls the pack gently across his eye
AMY
Norville theres something I have
to tell you You see Im not really
a secretary

NORVILLE
They gaze

I know that Amy

AMY
-You do

NORVILLE
I understand that youre not very
skilled yet in the secretarial arts
Im not that skilled as president
Oh sure I put up a big front --
(massages his eye)
-- not that everyones buying it

AMY
I believe in you Norville --
At least I believe in your
intentions --

NORVILLE
Oh I dont blame them really I
guess I have sort of made a mess of
things These folks have to protect
their investment Most of them are
very nice people --

AMY
Norville you cant trust people
here like you did in Muncie

out at the city

AMY
Certain people are --

NORVILLE
Didja ever go to the top of old man
Larsons feed tower and look out
over the town

AMY
Huh

NORVILLE
You know on farm route 17

AMY
Oh yes In Muncie

NORVILLE
No In Vidalia Farm Route 17

AMY
Uh -- Yes Seventeen Yes I -- well
no I -- I never really Theres a

place I go now the cutest little
place near my apartment in Greenwich
Village Its called Anns 440 Its
a beatnik bar

NORVILLE
You dont say
AMY
Yes you can get carrot juice or
Italian coffee and the people there --
well none of them quite fit in
Youd love it -- why dont you come
there with me -- theyre having a
marathon poetry reading on New Years
Eve I go every year

NORVILLE
(puzzled)
Every year
AMY
Well -- this year -- if its good I

plan to make it a tradition Uh my
it certainly is beautiful --

She nods out at the city to avoid Norvilles quizzical
look

AMY
The people look like ants

NORVILLE
Well the Hindus say -- and the
beatniks also -- that in the next

life some of us will come back as
ants Some will be butterflies
Others will be elephants or creatures
of the sea

AMY
What a beautiful thought

NORVILLE
What do you think you were in your
previous life Amy

AMY

Oh I dont know Maybe I was just a
fast-talking career gal who thought
she was one of the boys --

NORVILLE
Oh no Amy pardon me for saying so
but I find that very farfetched

AMY
Norville there really is something
I have to tell you --

NORVILLE
That kind of person would come back
as a wildebeest or a warthog No I
think it more likely that you were a
gazelle with long graceful legs
gamboling through the underbrush
Perhaps we met once a chance
encounter in a forest glade I must
Morosely

have been an antelope or an ibex
What times we must have had —-
foraging together for sustenance
picking the grubs and burrs from one
anothers coats Or perhaps we simply
touched our horns briefly and went
our separate ways

AMY
I wish it were that simple Norville
I wish I was still a gazelle and
you were an antelope or an ibex

NORVILLE
Well can I at least call you deer
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha Seriously Amy the
whole thing is what your beatnik
friends call karma -- the great
circle of life death and rebirth

AMY
Yeah I think Ive heard of that
What goes around comes around

Thats it A great wheel that gives
us each what we deserve

MUSSBURGER

All right so the kid caught a wave
So right now he and his dingus are

on top Well this too shall pass
Myrtle J Mussburger didnt raise

her boy to go knockkneed at the first
sign of adversity I say we made
this kid and we can break him I

say the higher he climbs the harder
he drops I say yes the kid has a
future and in it I see shame
dishonor ignominy and disgrace
Sure sure the wheel turns the music plays and our

spin

aint over yet

NORVILLES OFFICE

A small chamber orchestra the musicians in tails sit
playing

Eine Kleine Nachtmusik Norville eyes closed reclines
in

his desk chair one uniformed woman stooping in front of

him manicuring his nails another behind massaging his

temples A tailor is pinning up his pant cuffs

A French sculptor wearing a white smock a beret anda
goatee

squints at Norville and chisels at a block of marble with
a

stone chisel and hammer

A GOON sits off to one side hat insolently atop his
head

reading the funny papers

At length Norville stirs opens his eyes sits bolt
upright

batting away the hands of the manicurist and temple-
massager

NORVILLE
Hold it

The musicians playing dribbles away to silence

NORVILLE
-Nobody move nobody breathe

All sit frozen You could hear a pin drop

NORVILLE
An idea is coming

Eyes narrowed he gazes off into space squinting for his
idea

After a beat a woman ENTERS against the unblemished
white

background dressed in a flowing white dance robe
trailing

a long diaphanous veil She performs a flowingly
sensuous

dance moderne the MUSIC is a sensuous saxophone solo
with

lasciviously bending blue notes

After the woman has been dancing for several beats
Norville

enters dancing after her pursuing her He is wearing a

coatless suit his sleeves rolled up his thin tie
loosened

The woman dances around him letting her diaphanous veil
trail sinuously around his body
We hear an ECHOING voice

Onto it has been rendered a top view which is a perfect
circle and a side view which is a vertical line
Norville gazes stupidly at the circle
BUZZ

He produces a tall glass of lemonade with a straw sitting
in

it

BUZZ

little ridges on the side that give

He holds his head over the glass to drink from the
vertical

straw

BUZZ

He bends the straw to drink from it at the horizontal

BUZZ

VOICES (VO)

BONG The toll is right at Norvilles ear Startled he
reaches up to press hands against his ears Distantly

He cant stand it Whimpering hands to his ears he
his way back toward the window

HIS POV

The open window at a steep angle Someone inside slides
shut

BACK TO SCENE

Norville waves

NORVILLE

His gesticulation and a shuffle step upset his balance --

SECOND HAND

Descending

NORVILLE

Falling turning lazily in the air -- and suddenly with
great moaning sound -- he stops suspended in mid-air

down feet in the air

It is much like the freeze frame on Waring Hudsucker that
the title of the film was supered over

He waves his arms to no effect looks around
PEOPLE IN STREET

Frozen in attitudes of laughter celebration Snow sifts
silently down around their motionless bodies

MUSSBURGER

In his office frozen with an idiotic laugh pasted to his
face

HIS PERPETUAL MOTION BALLS

Frozen one ball swung out but suspended hanging at the
apex of its arc Outside the great arched window snow
NORVILLE

He alone can move but doesnt fall He looks awkwardly
his body in a dive-bomber attitude canted steeply down
EXT HUDSUCKER CLOCK

Its sweep second hand is arrested on its downward sweep
WHINING NOISES emanate from within

NORVILLE
Twisting back to look up over his shoulder there is a
very distant -- SINGING
HIS POV
Looking up the length of the Hudsucker Building Someone
something wrapped in white is flying toward us coming
from the stars
We can make out a male voice accompanied by STRUMMING

VOICE (VO)

Shell be comin around the mountain

when she comes Shell be comin

around the mountain when she comes
NORVILLE
He gapes
ANGEL

-- For it is an Angel arrives He is a balding man

rimless glasses in a white robe large feathery wings
sprouting from his back and beating heavily until he

to rest in midair He puts aside the harp he has been
strumming on a nearby windowsill

ANGEL
Love that tune How ya doin kid

NORVILLE
Mr Mr Hudsucker

HUDSUCKER (ANGEL)
Ta-daaaa

Presenting himself he spreads his arms and stamps his
foot forgetting that there is nothing beneath his foot
stamp He lurches forward momentarily losing his

HUDSUCKER
Wooooo
He rights himself The halo spinning lazily over his head
has been jarred askew With a flick of his forefinger he
rights it

HUDSUCKER
-How dya like this thing Theyre
all wearin em upstairs now

He blows a dismissive raspberry

HUDSUCKER
Its a fad

He pats at his robe produces a white cigar
HUDSUCKER
Anyway I hear youve been having
uh
He casually flicks his thumb out of his fist lighting
He lights the cigar off his thumb takes a puff
HUDSUCKER
Been having some problems with

the board The more things change
know what Iyayayeeeeee

Pain reminds him that he has forgotten to extinguish his
flaming thumb which he now waves frantically about

HUDSUCKER
desus Christopher -- That smarts
Where was I Oh yeah the board I
guess Sidneys been puttin the screws
to ya huh Norman

NORVILLE
Norville

HUDSUCKER
Mm Well say what you like about
the mans ethics hes a balls-to-
the-wall businessman Beat ya any
way he can Straight for the jugular
Very effective

NORVILLE
Yes sir

HUDSUCKER
Anyway Any particular reason you
didnt give him my Blue Letter I
mean Jesus Norman just a dying
mans last words and wishes no big
deal

NORVILLE
Huh Oh geez Mr Hudsucker I
apologize there was an awful lot of
excitement and I guess I mustve
mislaid —-

HUDSUCKER
Its sittin in your apron pocket
right where you left it Imbecile

Norville reaches in and -—- pulls out the wrinkled Blue
Letter
NORVILLE
Oh geez
HUDSUCKER

Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is
grounds for dismissal

NORVILLE
Geez I --

HUDSUCKER
Ah its New Years Im not gonna
add to your woes Im just saying

NORVILLE
Yessir

HUDSUCKER
Well why dont ya read it

NORVILLE
Sir

HUDSUCKER
Yeah go ahead Might learn somethin

NORVILLE
Yes sir

He tears open the envelope reads

NORVILLE
From the desk of Waring Hudsucker
To Sidney J Mussburger Regarding
My demise Dear Sid By the time you
read this I will have joined the
organization upstairs -- an exciting
new beginning I will retain fond
memories of the many years you and I --

HUDSUCKER
Yeah yeah its the standard
resignation boilerplate -- go down

to the second paragraph

NORVILLE
Many years uh I know that you
will be wondering why I have decided
to move on ending my tenure at
Hudsucker and here on Earth You
will be thinking Why now when things
are going so well Granted from the
standpoint of our balance sheet and
financials sure sure were doing
fine However Sid These things
have long since ceased to give me
pleasure I look at myself now and
no longer see the idealistic young
man who started this company Now I
see only an empty shell whom others
call a success How has this come
to pass When and why did I trade
all of my hopes dreams and
aspirations for the emptiness of
power and wealth What the heck have
I done

As Norville reads Hudsucker casually examines his
fingernails
then pats down a yawn

NORVILLE
Looking back now Sid I see
that I allowed time and age to corrupt
my dreams Instead of fiercely
guarding what was timeless inside of
myself I let the hubbub of earthly
commerce erode my character and
dissolve my better self How is it
that some manage to preserve
themselves where I have failed
Sidney I do not know Perhaps if
others love you you may more securely

love yourself -- but I am alone I
loved a woman once Sid as you well
know -- a beautiful vibrant lady

an angel who in her wisdom saw fit
to choose you instead of I

Norville is interrupted by loud blubbering He looks up
Hudsucker is weeping loudly into a white handkerchief

He saws at his nose gives it a loud honk and urgently
quavers in a voice strangled with emotion

HUDSUCKER
Skip this part

He waves his hankie in get-on-with-it circles

HUDSUCKER
Last paragraph last paragraph

Norville looks down the page

NORVILLE
And so Sid the future does not
belong to such as I -- nor even you

We have made our compromises with
time The future belongs to the young
great

on

who may more energetically wage the
battle against corruption
Accordingly in the spirit of hope
and the ringing in of the new I
hereby bequeath my entire interest
in the company and my seat on the
board to whomever is Hudsuckers
most recent employee at the time of
my demise I know this will disappoint
you -—- you Sid who have served so
diligently and for so long But --

HUDSUCKER
-- tough titty toenails

He roars with laughter

HUDSUCKER
-Thatll show the bastard

He merrily wipes his eyes

HUDSUCKER
Yeah go ahead

NORVILLE
But Sid let me urge you to work
closely with the new president and
to keep giving Hudsucker Industries
all your energies -- but not your
soul For while we must strive for
success we must not worship it
Long live the Hud Waring
Hudsucker

Norville gives a musingly appreciative nod

HUDSUCKER
-Geez

Pleased with himself
HUDSUCKER
Yup Its all there Well see that

it gets delivered in the morning

Hudsucker picks up his lyre and heads back up toward the
stars

HUDSUCKER
Sheeel beeee
