join

THANOS smiles as the camera pans to Earth

TONY STARK (VO)

A MONTAGE OF THE FIRST AVENGERS MOVIE PLAYS

TONY STARK (VO)

(Continuing)
Loki crazy god from Asgard tries to get us to fight
the Hulk Well he was trying to take over the world
but he needed a distraction while he did it so he
tried to get us to fight the green monster who’s
really a teddy bear when he’s not raging Well anyway
we found out thanks to the Black Widow smart
assassin that she is and ultimately we that’s me Iron
Man The Hulk Thor Captain America Black Widow and
Hawkeye aka The Avengers with help from Nick Fury
and SHIELD foiled Loki’s plan and saved the
world I even directed a missile to outer space

THE CAMERA SHOWS STARK SMILING THEN PANS TO An un-amused BABY IN

PEPPER POTTS

TONY

TONY STARK
Ok you’re not going to be like this when we have
kids

Stark follows Potts

PEPPER POTTS
I thought we talked about this

TONY STARK
No you said something about you were busy running a

company

PEPPER POTTS
Exactly yours

It turns out they’re in an orphanage

EXT AN ORPHANAGE DAY

STARK walks out of the ORPHANAGE with PEPPER POTTS and HAPPY
HOGAN by his side as news cameras flash

NEWSREPORTER

Mr Stark could you tell us about the Maria Stark
foundation

EXT A TROPICAL LOCATION

SUPERIMPOSED Somewhere Unknown

INT A ROOM

DR BANNER watches a small screen TV while eating take-away
noodles

TV (VO)

Tony Stark was here earlier at an LA orphanage as
part of his Save the Community campaign which is
under his Maria Stark Foundation He plans to head to
New York today to unveil more projects And now a
reminder of the headlines Henry Peter Gyrich has just
been appointed by the NSA as US liaison to
SHIELD specifically to the group known as The
Avengers How this recent development will pan out
with SHIELD director Nick Fury is yet to be known
as Fury is yet to comment on the situation

The headline catches BANNER’S attention
A MAN walks in with some medical equipment
MAN (With accent)
(Excited)
Hey doctor you glad I get you American cable
EXT STARK INTERNATIONAL LONG ISLAND DAY

SUPERIMPOSED LONG ISLAND

A chauffeured car pulls up to a warehouse TONY STARK and
COLONEL RHODES step out They walk towards the warehouse

COLONEL RHODES
You mind telling me what this is

TONY STARK
Oh you’ll see
INT THE WAREHOUSE

The garage door is opened from outside STARK and RHODES stand
out looking in RHODES is shocked and confused

COLONEL RHODES
I thought you said were done making weapons

TONY STARK
I made these a long time ago before Afghanistan
Come I’1l1 show you their features

STARK proceeds to step in

STARK turns on the light and we are shown about a 100 MANDROIDS
all gathering dust STARK and RHODES walk the rows of mandroids
TONY STARK
I made five of these originally prototypes for the
US government Parts of it were based on an idea my
dad had to re-create the super soldier after Steve
Captain America went missing it’s also where I got
the idea to make the suit in the cave

COLONEL RHODES
You said you made five of them Tony there’s a
multitude of them here

RHODES looks around to the multitude of them

TONY STARK
A hundred to be exact Obadiah had these many made
when he thought I wasn’t going to make it out of that
cave I only found out shortly after he died been
meaning to get rid of them

RHODES stops walking prompting STARK to

Cut to

COLONEL RHODES
You’ve been coming to New York for the past few years
and you not once thought to get rid of them then

TONY STARK
Maybe you forgot but the last few times I’ve been
here I’ve kind of had my hands full

TONY STARK walking in front of a row of Mandroids as COLONEL
RHODES follows him

TONY STARK
Let me show you what they can do

STARK stops in front of one

TONY STARK
(Contd)
You have a handkerchief

COLONEL RHODES passes him a handkerchief from his breast pocket
TONY STARK
(Contd)
Thank you

STARK wipes off some of the dust of one of the Mandroids and
hands it back to COLONEL RHODES much to the latter’s dismay

Cut to

TONY STARK
Right The Mandroids are constructed of titanium
alloy provides a fair deal of protection
(Opens it up)
There’s an internal air supply and a life support
system in case we want to put someone

COLONEL RHODES
Wait you made these with the intention of putting
people in it

TONY STARK
That was the plan Sensors include infrared scanners
and radar and sonar and the best part
(Reaches in and presses a button)
A full range radio and loudspeaker

BLACK SABBATH’S IRON MAN PLAYS

COLONEL RHODES
Yeah now I know you made this

COLONEL RHODES turns off the radio

COLONEL RHODES
(Contd)
What about the weaponry

TONY STARK
The suit can increase the wearers strength and
durability to superhuman degrees You should be able
to lift a car in this Not to mention the wide array
of offensive weaponry—electrostatic beams lasers
magnetic force punch-blasters neuro-stunners and
tractorrepellor beams

COLONEL RHODES
But it can operate without a human in it

TONY STARK
Yes individually each Mandroid has a remote control

COLONEL RHODES
Is there a way to operate all of them at the same
time

STARK realizes he never thought of that

EXT AN OPEN FIELD EARTH NIGHT

A portal opens up and the Kree soldier MAR-VELL falls out of
it A breathing apparatus falls nearby MAR-VELL struggles to
breathe as he tries to reach for the apparatus but fails to

INT HELICARRIER NIGHT

MARIA HILL
Sir one of our buildings on ground picked up signals
of some sort of strange activity

NICK FURY
Define “strange” Commander Hill

MARIA HILL
Alien strange sir Like the ones we’ve been receiving
for the past few weeks
(Looks at the paper)
I’ve got the co-ordinates here Should we send agents

NICK FURY
Send Mr Stark I believe he’s in New York

MARIA HILL
But sir shouldn’t we send a SHIELD agent

NICK FURY
By virtue of what he did the last time he was in New
York Mr Stark already is And send Rogers too Keep
an eye on Stark and send The Falcon
MARIA HILL nods

BLACK WIDOW
Hey suit up we’re on

BLACK WIDOW is about to walk out when

STEVE ROGERS
Hey
(Sits up)
How many songs did you see this could hold
(Lifs his ipod)

BLACK WIDOW
(Amused)
Depends on the size

STEVE ROGERS
They all kind of seem to come in the size

BLACK WIDOW
No I meant the size of the memory you know they have
memories Like how much space is available in the
ipod’s brain

STEVE ROGERS

I get it

(Stands up)
Have you heard anything about this new liaison they’re
sending

BLACK WIDOW
No except he’s a bit of a hard ass I’m sure he’s
nothing we can’t handle

ROGERS gets up
STEVE ROGERS

Is just that I’ve experienced bureaucracy before it’s

not all that great
EXT THE FIELD
MAR-VELL gets up breathing heavily He’s able to breathe much to
his surprise He has a little laugh His skin briefly turns
pink then back to its natural blue There’s a look of confusion
on his face

to Spider-man) from his suit MAR-VELL gets all tangled in it
but just as he breaks free to fly THE FALCON grabs him

INT THE QUINJET

IRON MAN and FALCON lead MAR-VELL onto the plane

INT HELICARRIER
NICK FURY talks to STARK ROGERS and THE FALCON

NICK FURY
So he just let you arrest him

FALCON
Not quite we had to chase him down
TONY STARK

TONY STARK
Says he’s from the planet Hala and he flies and he’s
actually heard of Thor Maybe they’re neighbours

NICK FURY
What’s with the colour change

TONY STARK
I have no idea

NICK FURY
Well I say we go have a chat with him He does speak
English right

TONY STARK
Apparently they all do across the universe
INT THE HELICARRIER HALLWAY

FURY walks with STARK and ROGERS one at each of his sides and
THE FALCON behind them

For the past few weeks we’ve been receiving these
weird signals on our radars cosmic in nature We
think this alien might have something to do with it

INT CONTAINMENT ROOM

FURY ROGERS FALCON AND STARK WALK IN MAR-VELL is kept ina
cage not unlike where Loki was put FURY addresses MAR-VELL

NICK FURY
My name is Nick Fury I hear your name is Mar-vell

MAR-VELL does not respond

NICK FURY
(Contd)
You said something about a war with whom

MAR-VELL
I’m I being held captive

NICK FURY
Technically yes But that could all change pending on
what you tell me about this war Consider this an
interrogation where you give us what we want and we
might set you free

MAR-VELL
Still sounds like capture

NICK FURY
Who are you at war with

MAR-VELL
The Skrulls

NICK FURY
What can you tell us about the Skrulls and more
importantly are they here

MAR-VELL
They could be

NICK FURY
What do you mean they could be

MAR-VELL
They have the ability to take any form like yours
(Points to FURY)

NICK FURY
Shape-shifters

MAR-VELL
Yes

NICK FURY

Just how do you intend to use our planet for war with
all its millions of inhabitants still in it

MAR-VELL
We devolve the human race to your pre-historic
essence and wipe you out

NICK FURY
I’m afraid you just got caught by the wrong group

FURY is distracted by MAR-VELL’S colour change

NICK FURY
(Contd)
Why do you change colour

MAR-VELL
I’m sick

NICK FURY
Sick from what

MAR-VELL
Radiation
FALCON
(Worried)
WHAT

FURY looks at the FALCON then back at MAR-VELL

(Shakes his head)
No he’s fine it’s me who should be worried This is

fascinating

A PLANE lands on the runway DR BANNER and HAWKEYE come off and
are met by NICK FURY

NICK FURY
Dr Banner

DR BANNER
Director Fury must be important if you personally
came to roll out the welcome mat

NICK FURY
Actually I was expecting someone else I’m sure agent
Barton briefed you on our situation
DR BANNER
Yes quite interesting
(Looks around)
I see you rebuilt the Helicarrier

NICK FURY
After we saved the world the council gave us enough

money to build two

DR BANNER
So what do you do with the rest of the money

NICK FURY
I put it in my bank account let’s go in

FURY walks ahead of BANNER and HAWKEYE

DR BANNER
He’s joking right

HAWKEYE
You can never tell with Fury
INT CONTAINMENT ROOM
DR BANNER observes MAR-VELL curiously through the glass

DR BANNER
I see the freak show never stops What is he exactly

STARK approaches

TONY STARK
He’s a Kree and that’s a bit of an irony coming from
you
(Extends his hand)
Dr Banner

DR BANNER
Mr Stark

The two shake

DR BANNER
(Contd)
Is that what makes him change colour

NICK FURY
He’s sick from radiation which is why you’re here

DR BANNER
(Teasing)
So nobody missed me

NICK FURY
(Approaching)
After almost single-handedly trying to destroy my
helicarrier Of course I missed you

INT INSIDE THE CAGE
DR BANNER attends to MAR-VELL while STARK observes

DR BANNER

deals in fantasy or science-fiction or both Wonder
what their characters would look like

HAWKEYE walks in

NICK FURY
Barton
HAWKEYE
Gyrich is here

BANNER
The liaison

TONY STARK

And so is Dr Banner
(To Nick Fury)
May I see you in private Director
Cut to

INT FURY’S OFFICE

GYRICH and FURY are alone

HENRY GYRICH
Should Dr Banner be here considering the last time he
made as much damage as those aliens Not to mention
the source of it all his destructive behavior as The
Hulk

NICK FURY
Should any of us be here considering we saved the
world

HENRY GYRICH
The other “Avengers” I can vouch for Stark’s a
genius Rogers is a hero I’1l make no mention of your
spies but Banner And where’s this god of thunder

guy

NICK FURY
I assume he’s somewhere in the heavens above us

HENRY GYRICH
You should know I’ve also been instructed to put
cameras on the Helicarrier if the need arises

NICK FURY
We already have cameras

HENRY GYRICH
Not ones re-routed to the NSA or any other US
government security department

NICK FURY
I thought SHIELD was under the guidance of the
Council

HENRY GYRICH
A council you disobeyed the last time Director Fury
Besides the council is the US government and I am but
its number one civil servant Expect to see me again
Fury sooner than later

GYRICH heads for the door FURY is not happy
INT OUTSIDE FURY’S OFFICE
GYRICH meets STARK

HENRY GYRICH
Mr Stark

GYRICH proceeds to shake STARK

TONY STARK
Gyrich I presume Your reputation precedes you

HENRY GYRICH
And you your infallible ego You suits almost killed
the president last time

The smile is wiped off STARK’s face
HENRY GYRICH
(Contd)
I hope we won’t make enemies of each other I’d love
to have a brilliant mind like yours on our side It’s
great what you did saving Manhattan a few years ago
directing that missile to space but it’s even greater
to obey orders There will be a next time Mr Stark
GYRICH walks away He passes ROGERS on his way
HENRY GYRICH

Sitting on a throne EMPORER DORRECK VII faces an army of
SKRULLS Skrull B is in front of him as they talk aside

EMPORER DORRECK VII
Who knows about this

SKRULL B
Very few people your highness

EMPORER DORRECK VII
If this gets out it could prove very fatal

SKRULL B
It could also stop the war sir

EMPORER DORRECK VII
SILENCE It is in our best interest to defeat the Kree
Empire not to make friends with them Where is he
now this Kree

INT CONTROL ROOM

The present AVENGERS and FURY are gathered as MAR-VELL talks to
them

MAR-VELL
The Skrulls originated from the planet Skrullos My
people have been engaged in a war with them for over
thousands of years now Once a peaceful race they
became militarized in part to some of our actions We
now seek new land to continue this war
NICK FURY
How did you find earth

MAR-VELL
Our people were directed here by a creature who
desires a cosmic cube the Skrulls invented

BANNER BLACK WIDOW
The Tesseract The Tesseract

MAR-VELL
Yes The skrulls invented the first cube known as the
shaper of the world It’s believed to be the only one
left We believe it to have got lost in Asgard home
of the god Odin Word is it was once here

NICK FURY
Not anymore

MAR-VELL
Yes we found out it was gone when we first came

STEVE ROGERS
First came

MAR-VELL
This isn’t our first time here It was that journey
that made us think of using your planet for our war

TONY STARK
Without any consideration of the lives here

NICK FURY
(To Tony Stark)
Remind you of when you sold weapons Stark

TONY STARK
I have a feeling that will haunt me forever

STEVE ROGERS
(To Mar-vell)
What happened to the other cubes

MAR-VELL
Destroyed in wars where races fought for its
possession

NICK FURY
This creature that wants the Tesseract what does it
intend to do with it

MAR-VELL
Thanos He intends to court death

STEVE ROGERS
What does he have to do with the Kree-Skrull war

MAR-VELL
It was he who sent the Chituaris to attack you with
Loki

THE AVENGERS look surprised

DR BANNER
You say you have radiation How did you get it

MAR-VELL
On my way back here I was trapped in a negative zone
and hit by it

TONY STARK looks surprised at the mention of a negative zone

STEVE ROGERS
What’s a negative zone

DR BANNER
It’s a theory of a place that exists only on anti-
matter

DR BANNER realizes most of the group is confused

DR BANNER

(Contd)
It’s a parallel universe to ours which we now know
exists

The group seems to get it
MAR-VELL

(To Dr Banner)
I can tell you have some sort of radiation too
BANNER seems a little uncomfortable

DR BANNER
How can you tell

MAR-VELL
I can sense these things it is part of my cosmic
nature
(To Nick Fury)
Whatever happened to the Tesseract

NICK FURY
We had it taken back to Asgard

MAR-VELL
It will be safe there for now

DR BANNER
Where do you find radiation in space

MAR-VELL
Not everything is of earthly origin Dr Banner

NICK FURY
Dr Banner may be able to help with your radiation
problem
(Turns to Banner)
Banner

DR BANNER
I haven’t even cured myself

Noticing the gravity of the situation and NICK FURY not smiling
BANNER responds

DR BANNER
(Contd)
Er I would have to study his molecular structure
despite the fact that he looks human he clearly isn’t
I’1l need to use the lab

NICK FURY
I’m afraid that might not be possible With Gyrich
breathing down my neck this might not be the place for
you all We need a new place one Gyrich has no
immediate access to
TONY STARK
Ah I might have a solution
(Turns to MAR-VELL)
Youre going to need a change of costume

group is inside the mansion

TONY STARK

It’s three floors up and three floors down Before my
mom had plans of turning this into a museum my father
used this place to hide his “arsenals” in case another
war broke out Instead he somehow contributed into
making wars break out elsewhere across the world
Funny turn of events anyway it’s home

(Turns to face the rest of the group)
So what do you think

THOR My home is bigger

The Avengers turn round to see THOR at the doorway with HILL and
SCOTT LANG behind him

MARIA HILL
Look who I found

BANNER

TONY STARK
Did they put a telecommunication network on Asgard
like did you just call him

MARIA HILL
And this is Scott Lang aka

BRUCE BANNER
(Surprised)

Ant-man

SCOTT LANG
I’m quite big in other places
MARIA HILL rolls her eyes at Lang’s comment

TONY STARK
(To Banner)
He’s actually the man who stole from Ant-man
SHIELD caught him

LANG notices MAR-VELL

SCOTT LANG

TONY STARK

TONY STARK

(To LANG)
How was your trip Lang

SCOTT LANG
Great I rode with Hamlet here

THOR

BLACK WIDOW

TONY STARK

nap Clean up after yourself

STEVE ROGERS

TONY STARK

Oh in that case there’s a weapons room below a gym
and Hawkeye for you there’s a test-shooting room I
know you’ll love that For the rest of you there’s a
training room and Dr Banner there’s a lab that I
think was supposed to be a cryogenic room

(Turns to Steve Rogers teasing)
I think that’s where you were supposed to be frozen
maybe

SCOTT LANG
Howd you get this dig

TONY STARK
«I’m Tony Stark

SCOTT LANG
Right forgot

What

DR BANNER
He’s sort of adapting to earth’s atmosphere It’s why
he can breathe without the apparatus Kree’s aren’t
suppose to be able to breath here but somehow he’s
been able to Think it might have to do with the

INT STARK WAREHOUSE

LANG is listening to the radio as he puts the finishing touches
on the device

RADIO PRESENTER 1 (VO)
We interrupt this program to bring you this news
bulletin Sources from upper Manhattan claim that Iron
Man has just attacked the UN building It’s not sure
as of present if this is indeed the philanthropist
Tony Stark

RADIO PRESENTER 2 (VO)
You know Bob in the past we’ve had these imposters
building their very own iron man suits so we can’t
tell for now

RADIO PRESENTER 1
But doesn’t that bring to question whether we should
allow people with these special skills such as Tony
Stark to run around I mean shouldn’t they be
registered shouldn’t there be a way to control them
to avoid this

EXT UN BUILDING
The Hulk steps on the Skrull Iron Man as Falcon sweeps in

MAR-VELL
I can help but I’m going to need the Sentry

NICK FURY
I’m afraid Lang already dismantled it

MAR-VELL
It can be re-built with the help of Yon-Rogg

NICK FURY
Perhaps your alien weaponry has done more harm than
good Mar-vell

It can self-destruct and take a number of Skrulls
with it

THOR
It’s kept safe to stop worlds fighting over it
SUPER SKRULL

what is ours in due time

vell We know your human friends are hiding him Hand
him to us and we will spare this planet you so hold
dear from destruction

place his hammer on him The Hulk turns around seemingly in a
field full of Skrulls he roars at them to scare them off The
look startled at first then they all rush towards him

the multitude of them some stabbing him with their blade-hands

a force field stopping Hulk from entering

Thor smashes his hammer on the force field with no effect He
keeps trying as an on-fire Super Skrull moves ever so closer
Finally Thor throws his hammer at the opposite side of the force
field causing it to bounce within the force field till it
actually hits the Super Skrull and knocks him out The force
field is released Thor walks up to the unconscious Super
Skrull

THOR
Odin said knock you out

As the Hulk now approaches a free Thor the remaining Skrulls
begin to recoup catching Captain America’s attention
