NARRATOR
To most of America in 1913 the Age
of Innocence had arrived and the
stories of the Indian Wars and the
GoldRuSh and the Great Gunfighters
had become either barroom ballyhoo
or front-porch remiraiscences But
on both sides of the io Grande men
still lived as thia7 had in the 1 70s
and 1 80s -- unchanged men ina
changing land
THEY WEAR THE KHAKI UNIFORMS OF THE UNITED STATES CnVALJRY
The horses bear the government brand and the saddles are
regulation
PIKE BISHOP wearing lieutenants bars rides slightly

of the others He rides stiffly always slightly in pain
Pike is a not unhandsome leather-faced man in his early
forties A thoughtful self-educated top gun with a penchant
for violence who is afraid of nothing - except the changes
in himself and those around him

Make no mistake Pike Bishop is not a hero -- his values are
not ours -- he is a gunfighter a criminal a bank robber

killer of men His sympathies are not for fences for
trolleysand telegraphs or better schools He lives outside
ALGEL

with

and against society because he believes in that way of life
and if he has moments of sympathy for others moments of
regret t hey are short lived He is not a good man
according to the righteous To them he is totally bad
and he wouldnt have it any other way

Next to him DUTCH ENGSTROM wears the uniform of a sergeant
Dutch is biga€zZ good-natured with a fast gun hand strong
loyalty and like Pike a bone deep distaste for rules and
regulations He can sing has more than his share of charm
but believes in nothing except two men and Pike is one
Behind them ride two brothers LYLE and TECTOR GORCH
dressed as corporals Lyle and Tector are big tough hot
tempered and sudden They work together eat together and

sometimes sleep together with the same whore Brutal
vicious in a fight illiterate they are always pressing
for an advantage and once they get it -- they never let go
They are without loyalty or honor to anyone except each
other and that is limited

A fifth man wears the single stripe of a PFC This is

Angel is a good-looking bilingual Mexican boy in his middle
20s who has seen so much blood and violence and cruelty
under Diaz that he rebelled -- but his rebellion was not

Villa or Obregon his was a one-man revolution against them
all He believes in his family his village and the inherent
dignity of man (some men at least) He is faster than his
companions with a gun -- and a better shot -- but he cant
laugh at the loss of love or suffer the loss of pride --
Mexican pride - a pride that can kill him but if it does
he will have no regrets

REACHING THE SIGN THE MEN STOP Witutspeaking they begin
to brush off their clothing and get their uniforms in order

4 THE SIGN READS IN RAILROAD LETTERS SAN RAFAEL TEXAS
And underneath someone has printed

It invites us to stay with the community

Tector looks at Angel for a long moment then turns to Pike

TECTOR
I never enlisted to serve with no
smart-mouthed kid

ANGEL
Nor I with dogs

DUTCH
(grinning at Pike)
ITd like to transfer to another unit --
there seems to be dissension in the
