STUART LITTLE 2
FADE IN
EXT NEW YORK CITY - DAWN
A look at how birds live in the city emphasizing the
scavenging nature of their existence We see birds eating
off the ground out of trash cans even swooping down to
steal a piece of donut out of the hand of a sleepy citizen
just leaving his house
The last bird we see flies towards the house of the Little
family
INT LITTLE HOUSE - DAY
The first hint of morning light enters the Little
household All is quiet and peaceful MR AND MRS
LITTLE are asleep in bed THROUGH the window we see bird
eyes spying in on them
CLOSEUP - ALARM CLOCK
BLASTING a rendition of STARS AND STRIPES FOREVER into
the Littles bedroom
WIDER

The bird flies off the window sill and disappears

Even before theyre awake Mr and Mrs Littles feet
begin swiveling in time to the music

Then we hear a BABY CRYING

CLOSEUP - MRS LITTLE

sitting upright in bed She turns OFF the ALARM On her
ring finger is a beautiful engagement ring

WIDER

Mrs Little gets out of bed and we FOLLOW her OVER TO a
crib wherein sits a beautiful nine-month-old girl MARTHA

LITTLE Mrs Little picks her up

MRS LITTLE
Moomys here No more crying

Marthas diaper is askew

( )

MRS LITTLE
Ohh See this is what happens
when Daddy changes you at 4AM

Boys

INT BOYS ROOM

ANOTHER ALARM CLOCK It GOES OFF and makes a FACTORY
WHISTLE NOISE

ANGLE ON GEORGE

in the lower bunk He grumbles and turns over

ANGLE ON UPPER BUNK

A tiny lump under a blanket as it begins to move Moments
later a tail emerges from underneath the sheet It moves
tentatively as if checking things out The tail is
followed by a rear-end dressed in bright pajamas with a
print pattern featuring pineapples (or something funnier)
and then the remainder of a four-inch body It is STUART

(For those who havent read the book or seen the movie
Stuart is a mouse)

Stuart is sleepy He staggers around almost blindly He
almost steps off the edge of his bunk This wakes him
more completely He rubs his eyes and stretches and
smiles Grabbing hold of a miniature firemans pole built
out of tinker toys slides down to the lower bunk and
crosses over to Georges sleeping head

STUART
George wake up

George is a hard wake-up
Stuart stands on Georges chest and jumps up and down

STUART
George

GEORGE

STUART

Pee Wee Soccer Our first game

( )

Georges eyes pop open and he gasps Hes immediately
nervous

GEORGE
Soccer Uh No I cant today
I caught a cold while I was

sleeping

He sneezes and blows Stuart halfway across the bed
Stuart scrambles back quickly He grabs Georges glasses
from the nightstand and masterfully engineers them onto
Georges face He taps on the glasses

STUART
Youll be fine Come on were
gonna be great Were gonna play
like Brazilians

Stuart takes off his pajama top and soccer-kicks it across
the room into a hamper

INT KITCHEN - DAY

Mrs Little is rushing around the kitchen feeding the
baby and making breakfast for everyone at the same time

The CAMERA FOLLOWS her TO the kitchen table as she puts
another spoonful of cereal into the babys mouth The
baby is sitting in her highchair between her brothers who
are in their uniforms

INT DINING ROOM - LITTLE LATER 15

Stuart climbs back into the cockpit of the PLANE He
opens up the instruction book He reaches under the
dashboard His sweater catches on the onoff switch and
clicks it ON by accident

Suddenly the MOTOR WHIRS into action Snowbell hearing
the noise screams jumps up and dashes out

Before Stuart realizes what is happening the airplane is
taxiing down the table George and Will run in and yell
over the NOISE of the ENGINE

GEORGE
Stuart what are you doing
STUART
(panicked yelling
back)
Im not doing it It wont turn

off

The plane hits the remote knocking it off the table It
breaks The plane flies off the table and into the next
room George and Will run after it

As they enter the dining room the PLANE BUZZES their
heads

STUART

At that exact moment Mrs Little opens the front door
carrying a freshly-cut bouquet

MRS LITTLE
Have you ever seen prettier roses

The PLANE RIPS through the bouquet and flies outside

MRS LITTLE
Stuart

All the Littles run outside

EXT LITTLE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION 16

They chase Stuart across Fifth Avenue into the park
Stuart has rose petals stuck to his face blinding him
Screaming he frantically brushes them off -- just in time
to see a group of nuns He barely avoids hitting them

( )

16

Stuart covers his eyes and screams as the plane disappears
behind some bushes We hear STUART SCREAM then we hear
the sound of a CRASH

When Stuart opens his eyes he discovers that both he and
the plane have collided with a thick bush and both wings
are dangling precariously at the side

Stuart crawls out of the wreckage and scampers down to the
ground We hear the anxious voices of the entire Little
family as they race toward him

MRS LITTLE
Stuart Stuart Are you all

STUART

STUART
(feeling like a
failure)

dangerous

GEORGE
(sarcastic)

George picks up the wreckage throws it in the trash and
leaves

his choices And Im no longer
too sure about dancing -- you

Stuart and Mr Little are alone

MR LITTLE
Since she has Little Martha her
protective maternal instincts are
running somewhat amok

STUART
Ill say

MR LITTLE
Also she just loves you so much
Stuart its hard for her to
think of you in danger

STUART
This has been a bad day Mom

at me and you and Mom are
fighting

MR LITTLE
Well its not one of our best
days but its not that bad The
thing about being a Little is you
always see the bright side Every
cloud has a silver lining

STUART
Every cloud

INT SCHOOL —- DAY 17

Stuart is sitting at a miniature school desk on the top of
a regular school desk He is dwarfed by a huge book
propped open on a stand before him We hear everyone in
the class turning the page Stuart crosses over to his
book grabs hold of the bottom of the mammoth page and
walks it from one side of the book to the other

TEACHER
Okay does anyone know the

difference between longitude and
latitude

sticking through his fly Irwin is aggressively picking
his nose

IRWIN

STUART
Uh Nothing

Stuart slides down his desk and gets into a tiny red car
parked alongside it He puts his knapsack in the back
seat and takes off following a red line painted alongside
the lockers just for him He HONKS whenever someone gets
in his way Suddenly George runs over to him

GEORGE

EXT NEW YORK STREET - DAY 18

Stuart is driving quietly down the sidewalk Hes gone
abaut a block when suddenly he hears a loud SQUAWK and
then sees what appears to be a wounded BIRD fall out of
the sky and land in the passenger seat of his car

STUART
Oh my --

Startled her swerves the CAR all over the sidewalk until
SCREECHING to a stop He stares at the bird lying in his
car Although we dont know it yet her name is MARGALO

Stuart stares at her with a mixture of concern and
fascination She is definitely a unique creature not
much bigger than Stuart She is wearing a pilots leather
helmet and goggles and looks like what Amelia Earhart
might have looked like if she was a bird Cautiously he
reaches out to touch her

STUART
Miss Miss Are you alive

She doesnt answer Stuart listens for her heartbeat

STUART
Shes alive

Slamming on the gas pedal Stuart RACES quickly down the
sidewalk

STUART
Out of the way please Injured
bird coming through

Stuart and Margalo are zipping through pedestrian traffic
when she opens her eyes and looks groggily at Stuart

MARGALO
Whats going on Where am I

STUART
Its all right Youre going to

MARGALO
(looks around)
But wheres Falcon

STUART

At that instant a huge terrifying BIRD swoops down from
the sky All Stuart can make out is a sharp beak and

terrifying pointed talons rushing at him Margalo yells
to Stuart

MARGALO
That Falcon Drive Get out of
here

STUART
Oh my

Stuart GUNS the CAR and goes shooting down the sidewalk
Margalo turns defiantly in the back seat and waves her
fist at the bird

MARGALO
Get lost you disgusting vulture

STUART
(nervously)

Do we really want to antagonize
him

( ) 18

MARGALO
Just drive
(cursing again at the
hawk )
Eatmy feathers you vile buzzard

STUART
See youre just reducing yourself
to his level

Stuart drives faster People scatter in all directions
A metal grate begins to open like a drawbridge on the
sidewalk in front of him Stuart cant get around it

STUART
Uh-oh weve got a problem

MARGALO
You can make it Dont slow down

Like Smokey and the Bandit he takes a deep breath aims
full-speed at the grate and goes sailing over the top

ANGLE ON MARGALO
as they are careening through the air

MARGALO
See Whatd I tell ya

Stuarts eyes are lit up with excitement He is thrilled

STUART
Yeah

CAR

lands safely on the down-sloping grate and continues along
the sidewalk but the massive bird is still in full
pursuit

Stuart SCREECHES around a corner and spots a stack of
plumbing supplies piled in front of a building He zooms
into an eight-foot long plastic pipe about six inches in
diameter Peering out the far end he can see Falcon
landing on the ground and looking around in total
confusion He has lost them The Falcon flies away
Stuart lets out a deep sigh Margalo looks up at Stuart
and whispers

GEORGE
How is it so far

STUART (0S)
Wet

Looking up from STUARTS POV we can see glimpses of his
fathers eyes looking down at him and occasional views of
the kitchen ceiling growing further and further away It
is like he is viewing the world from the wrong end of a
telescope

STUART
Theres a lot of slimy stuff on
the walls

GEORGE
What does it look like

BACK TO SCENE
Stuart looks around Its wet and slimy

( )

37

STUART
Like the inside of your nose

A look of revulsion flashes across Georges face

ANGLE ON STRING
It is fraying as Stuart descends but no one notices

MR LITTLE

No Just more pipe And

happened she unlatches her pearl necklace and lowers it
into the drain Mrs Little stares at her with shock and
admiration

MRS LITTLE
Why didnt I think of that

Stuart calls out

STUART

Margalo quickly takes to the air raising the necklace
with Stuart holding on to it and bringing him to safety

He emerges from the drain empty-handed but to the cheers
of his entire family

Mrs Little grabs her little boy and presses him to her
cheek Youve never seen so much love

Oh Stuart To think I could have
lost you for a stupid ring

STUART

her face

EXT SIDE OF PISHKIN BUILDING - DAY 58

A helium-filled balloon rising up alongside the Pishkin
Building

A Coke can is suspended beneath it like a makeshift
gondola Stuart is standing inside it slowly dribbling
out handfuls of sand to lighten the load He looks down
at Snowbell who is waving at him as Stuart rises higher
and higher up the side of the building

OMITTED 59

EXT TOP OF BUILDING - DAY 60
Stuart rising even higher up the side of the building
The balloon is being buffeted by winds

He is almost at the top He sees the falcon gargoyles
just above him And then he is there With perfect
timing he steps out of the gondola onto the terrace
surrounding the pinnacle of the building It is strangely
empty and unguarded Clearly not many people arrive this
way

Cautiously Stuart reaches into his knapsack and pulls out
a bow made out of a paper clip and rubber band and a pin
cushion full of arrows He begins stalking through the
large space crouched like a policeman with a gun

STUART
(quietly)
Margalo Margalo Are you up
here Is anybody here

Stuart sees a large frightening-looking bird shadow on
the wall He gasps in fear then turns to face the
danger Only it turns out to be Margalo

STUART

Margalo Are you all right
MARGALO

Stuart What -- Stuart youve

got to get out of here Falcon

Stuart follows Falcon into Falcons lair

INT LAIR - CONTINUOUS ACTION 61

There is stolen merchandise -- jewels rings pins

He looks at Margalo She smiles

FALCON

Stuart fires a pin from his bow It
Falcon turns sideways and catches it
he spits it back at Stuart The pin
collar and pins him to the wall his
pathetically off the ground Falcon

STUART

Stuart smiles

travels truly but
in his mouth Then
catches Stuarts
feet dangling

keeps coming at him

I hope I wasnt out of line with

that ‘birdbrain remark

Falcon pulls out the pin

Stuart drops to the floor

Falcon towers over him spreads his wings and screeches as

he shows his claws

MARGALO

Falcon no

( ) 61

Falcon picks Stuart up in his talons and flies him over
the edge of the building He holds him for a beat then
drops him

MARGALO
Stuart

She goes to help him but Falcon intercepts her violently
and carries her SQUAWKING into an old small battered
birdcage He throws her inside and slams the door

MARGALO
You didnt have to kill him

FALCON
I didnt The sidewalks gonna do
it

STUART FALLING

Stuart screaming is tumbling rapidly He gets an idea
He pulls off his backpack and empties it Then clutching
it by the backstraps he holds it over his head The wind
catches it creating a parachute effect which at least
slows his rate of descent It fills with air and becomes
a parachute He begins to float down

He lands in a moving garbage truck Luckily it is a soft
landing and he quickly stands up Unfortunately as he
stands a load of garbage is dumped on him A big metal
can hits him on the head His eyes crisscross as the
world blurs before him and he topples onto a mound of
garbage bags and passes out

EXT GARBAGE BARGE 62
Stuart covered in coffee grinds and not sure where he is

He hears the sound of a BOAT WHISTLE and grabs his
throbbing head Quickly he climbs to the top of a mound
of garbage bags and gasps He is on a garbage barge
pulling away from a Manhattan dock and heading out to sea

At the far end of the barge up a high metal wall he sees
the barge CAPTAIN and his first mate piloting the boat

He scampers over a ton of rubbish and tries to call up to
them

STUART
Help Help This is a mistake
Im not supposed to be here

( )

62

But they are far away and he is barely a speck to them
his tiny voice drowned out by the ROAR of the ENGINE

EXT PISHKIN BUILDING - DAY 64

Snowbell is standing anxiously in front of the Pishkin
Building looking lost and forlorn He stares up ata
clock and shakes his head

SNOWBELL

EXT WILLS HOUSE - DAY 65

There is a KNOCK at Wills door WILLS MOTHER answers

EXT GARBAGE BARGE - DAY 66

Stuart is on the barge Hes using a broken piece of
pencil to write on a dirty scrap of paper A whiskey
bottle is alongside

STUART
Dear Mom and Dad I am writing
this letter and placing it in this
whiskey bottle so you will know
whats happened to me -- your son
Stuart Little In a few minutes I
will be dumped under a ton of
disgusting trash into the East
River
(thinks )

No that might upset them Dear
Mom and Dad Ive run away to
join the circus I will from now
on be known as Gazombo the
Mouseboy Say good-bye to George
Give Martha a kiss for me All
my love Gazombo

He rolls it up and starts to put it in the bottle but
drops the bottle It breaks

STUART
Oh I am so useless I thought a
Little is always supposed to see
the silver lining that must
mean Im not even a real Little

Behind Stuart something glints Stuarts ears twitch
Hes sensing something Slowly he turns He sees the
glint

STUART
A silver lining

He walks towards the pile of garbage from which the glint
appeared He begins tossing aside refuse until he sees
something that amazes him

STUART
I dont believe it
(gets closer)
It is

To his absolute astonishment he has found his broken
airplane buried in the garbage

STUART
My airplane

( )

66

He pulls pieces of the plane out of the rubble and stares
at what remains of it It is not a pretty sight It has
broken wings a smashed front window a badly damaged
fuselage and the flight manual jammed inside Its in
terrible shape and there is no way it could ever fly

STUART
The silver lining This is it I
ama Little

He takes a deep breath and begins scouring the barge for
anything he can find

We watch Stuart consulting the flight manual and
assembling a pile of strange objects Band-Aids Styrofoam
cups and packing material old combs string cardboard
Q-Tips rubber bands electrical wire and lots of AAA
batteries which he pulls out of old television remotes and
broken electronic toys

Dowzer and Snoop fly over to watch Stuart intrigued by
his extraordinary industriousness

He hears

SNOOP (0S)
Hey Dowzer come here

Stuart peeks over a mound of garbage and sees two stupid
pigeons SNOOP and DOWZER Snoop is looking at something
we cant see
SNOOP
Wanna see the stupidest-looking
pigeon you ever saw

DOWZER
Sure

Dowzer comes over beside Snoop
SNOOP
Hey look Now theres two of
them And they both look stupid

REVEAL Snoop and Dowzer are looking in a broken old
mirror Stuart reacts to their stupidity

STUART

Dowzer and snoop begin to laugh

SNOOP

DOWZER
And you dont even have an hour
Theyre gonna dump this garbage in

STUART

Stuart makes one more effort to start the plane and to
everyones amazement the ENGINE TURNS OVER In an instant
Stuart is taxiing for lift-off

STUART
Now what

Gasping he looks back at the manual for guidance The
birds jump out of the way and stare in astonishment as he
speeds past them Faster and faster he goes but does not
leave the ground The end of the barge is rapidly
approaching Stuart grits his teeth The birds seem
nervous too

The plane is just inches away from the end of the runway
and poised to do a perfect nose dive into the sea Snoop
covers his eyes with his wings when suddenly at the last
possible second the plane rises into the air

The Captain looks up just in time to see Stuart fly off
the barge

sees the broken cage and sees Margalo

Falcon scans the roof until he sees Snowbells tail
sticking out of the paint car Margalo steps in front of
the can

Falcon walks over to the CAN which CONTINUES TO TREMBLE
He kicks it It rolls to the edge of the roof

The can teeters on the edge of the roof and stops Then
Falcon picks up a seed and spits it at the can The can
goes over the side

Snowbell in the can plummets Snowbell screams -- then
suddenly stops plummeting and starts to turn end-over-end
rapidly The handle of the paint can has been caught on
the end of a bare horizontal flagpole and spins rapidly

Well then that isnt going to be
very long

He raises his claws towards Margalos throat She closes
her eyes

At that very instant the PUTT-PUTT of Stuarts PLANE can
be heard Falcon spins around as the plane shoots around
from the side of the spire aiming right for Falcons face
They all seem stunned to see the other Falcon jumps
back onto the terrace Margalo cries when she sees him

unconscious

on Falcon Falcon rises into the air

He spreads his wings SCREECHES his eyes turn red and
his talons actually glisten He fills the entire window
of the plane

FALCON
Youre mine now you little
rodent

Stuart gasps and grabs for the servo Suddenly the plane
does a flipflop backwards somersault and tumbles rapidly
toward the traffic below It is an unexpected maneuver
