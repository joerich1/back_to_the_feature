TREY EDWARD SHULTS
Over black ‘Lock Raven’ by Animal Collective begins
FADE UP
EXT STREET - LATE AFTERNOON

Music slowly builds as we pass over pavement in EXTREME SLOW
MOTION

- The CAMERA tilts up to find the back of bicycle tires
and two feet pedaling

We lift higher to discover a GIRL riding the bike
The girl’s hair blows through the wind

- The girl slowly takes her hands off the handle bars
She stretches her arms out to her side and lifts them into
the air She opens her hands to let the wind rush between
her finger tips She looks free like she is flying

The CAMERA tilts up past the girl and stares directly
into the sun The light is blinding and it gives way to a
splash of beautiful colors that are alive and bright as they
flow in and out of each other We see green blue yellow
orange etc

We continue to take in the music as the colors begin to
merge and morph Different images begin to take shape

‘FloriDada’ by Animal Collective slams on

The beat grows with a rush of images They range from the
macro to the micro waves trees stop signs cats
Everglades hands shells ghettos sand cows seagulls
gators mailboxes fish golf courses

The first verse hits and the images continue to shoot by
street lights cars lakes suburbs scales plants
manatees eyes malls shopping centers lizards
skyscrapers grass beaches clouds rain trailer parks
dogs houses ducks a variety of people that range in class
size gender and race

The pre- chorus hits and we continue to experience this
overwhelming yet beautiful chaotic collage of life energy and
movement A coked up bum-rush of images through the melting pot of
South Florida The images continue until they are all colliding
and super imposed over each other

The chorus hits
ANIMAL COLLECTIVE ( IN SONG )
Flori Flori Flori Flori Florida
Floridada Floridada

as the CAMERA spins around to find ALEXIS and TYLER (18

barely contain their love Tyler drives with the music cranked as he
and Alexis are essentially doing a karaoke duet at the top of their
lungs

overpower the music

him in a 360 as he pumps himself up The beat comes in and the

him to the mat

The cat just shakes It seems to have some kind of disability where
his hind legs continually bounce

TYLER (CONTD) EMILY
EMILY WHAT

TYLER (CONTD)
YOUR UGLY CAT IS IN MY ROOM

The cat walks towards Tyler and Tyler hisses at it The cat stops
Emily finally comes in and picks up her cat

EMILY TYLER (CONTD)

Jerk I don’t want that beast in
my room-

EMILY (CONTD)
The only beast in here is you

Emily leaves and Tyler shuts the door behind her Headlights shine
through Tyler’s window and he turns around

INT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

The music cuts out as Tyler hugs his mom and then he takes a seat on
the kitchen counter Catherine unpacks her bags from work

CATHERINE

fitted
CATHERINE TYLER (CONTD)

CATHERINE

TYLER

CATHERINE

Tyler’s dad finally walks into the kitchen

RONALD CATHERINE (CONTD)
I keep telling her if she I don’t want to work Fridays
would spread her schedule out I need my weekends

and work Fridays she
wouldnt be so exhausted-

RONALD (CONTD)
Kiss

Catherine stops unpacking her bags for a second and kisses Ronald

RONALD (CONTD)
There’s my girl

Ronald gives Catherine a hug and Tyler watches There is still love
in Tyler’s parent’s relationship but the chemistry is a little off
It’s clear that Catherine isn’t as into showing affection with
Ronald as he is with her We can feel more going on with their
marriage below the surface

CATHERINE
«- Good day

RONALD
Yeah Not bad

Ronald looks over at Tyler

RONALD (CONTD)
You get all your homework done

TYLER RONALD (CONTD)

Not yet-— Well what are you waiting
for

TYLER (CONTD)
I’m saying hi to mom- It’s a two second
break

RONALD
Uh huh

Catherine seems slightly annoyed by Ronald’s persistence

CATHERINE
How’s your knee

RONALD
You know The usual

CATHERINE
Can you start the bath

RONALD
You got it

Ronald heads for their bathroom then calls out

RONALD (CONTD)
Hey Did you take some of my pain pills

CATHERINE RONALD (CONTD)
No Why It’s all good

Ronald leaves and Catherine goes back to unpacking her bags

DOCTOR STEVE (0S)
SLAP stands for Superior Labrum Anterior
and Posterior

INT DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY
SLOW ZOOM OUT as Doctor Steve is shuffling through Tyler’s MRI report

DOCTOR STEVE
This top area here is also where the biceps
tendon attaches to the labrum That’s why you are
also feeling pain running up your arm
(MORE)

DOCTOR STEVE (CONTD)
Now in your case if you don’t remember a
specific event then you could have aggravated
your shoulder and then over time with repetition
made it worse and worse Since it’s the labrum
it’s not just overhead activities Any strenuous
activity on the biceps tendon can enhance it as
well

TYLER
Yes sir But what does all of this mean

DOCTOR STEVE

Well you’ve done extreme damage You have a
level 5 out of 5 SLAP tear I’ve actually never
seen this level tear in person

TYLER
I mean- It’s not that bad I can easily push
through it

The CAMERA lands in a tight profile on Tyler

DOCTOR STEVE TYLER (CONTD)
I’m afraid you need surgery But- I’m in season right now
or you’re running the risk of
permanent irreversible
damage-

DOCTOR STEVE (CONTD)
I understand But Tyler this is very serious I
highly recommend you stop all physical activity
immediately and we get you surgery as soon as
possible

TYLER
Well what if we did it at the end of season and
I recover over summer I could be good for next
year- College

The CAMERA slowly rotates around Tyler’s face and ZOOMS IN

DOCTOR STEVE
I don’t believe you can make it another match let
alone the entire season Then to be honest
recovery would last much longer than just the
summer You will likely never fully recover to
the way you were but the sooner we address this
the better You’re young and you should heal
very well It’s just going to take time

The CAMERA sits on Tyler He looks like he can’t fully process what
he’s hearing

DOCTOR STEVE (CONTD) TYLER
- I can call your mom if No- You don’t have to do
you- that I’ll talk to her I

wanna tell my parents myself

DOCTOR STEVE (CONTD)

I understand I’m very sorry Tyler I
know this wasn’t what you wanted to
hear

INT SPEEDY’S - CONTINUOUS

Tyler waits in line at a hole-in-the-wall liquor store A few men with
dreads are sitting behind the cash register They look Tyler over

INT WRESTLING GYM - DAY

Tyler and teammates are wrestling Tyler is paired up with a WRESTLER who has braces They are grappling until the wrestler pulls on
Tyler’s arm in the wrong way creating pain in Tyler’s shoulder

BOOM

Tyler sweeps the wrestler’s leg and throws him to the ground Tyler
stays on top as he takes his arm and rubs it all over the wrestler’s
face really forcefully By doing this Tyler is forcing the inside
of the kid’s mouth to clash against his braces

Eventually Tyler gets up The other wrestler rolls over and coughs up
blood Tyler can’t help but feel bad

INT RONALD’S OFFICE - NIGHT

Catherine’s voice echoes through the house as it plays from Ronald’s
computer speakers

CATHERINE (0S)
He’s feeling- just so hurt and confused
He broke down in tears today and Linda
continues to refuse any type of
communication Continue treatment as needed

Tyler is transcribing audio notes Catherine has made about her
patients From the notes we can infer that Catherine is a
therapist In the distance Tyler can hear his dad fart and talk to
himself Tyler shakes his head and smiles Ronald enters the room
and hovers over Tyler checking his work

RONALD
How’s it coming
TYLER
Good
RONALD

TYLER RONALD (CONTD)
Half way there- What’s this format Why’s the

Ronald sits down across from Tyler Catherine’s voice is still
playing through the speakers

RONALD (CONTD)
What’s this attitude about

TYLER RONALD (CONTD)
What do you mean- You know exactly what I mean

Tyler shrugs

RONALD (CONTD)
Stop Turn it off and look at me

Tyler stops transcribing and turns to face his father

RONALD (CONTD)
Look around you for a second Who do you think
keeps all this running Your mother might be
great with the patients but she knows nothing
about the business If I quit my job and
stopped running your mother’s business you
think you’d even have a place to lay that big
head

TYLER
- No

RONALD
So What’s up

TYLER
I have a lot going on right now

RONALD
Boy- You don’t think me and your mom don’t have
a lot going on

(MORE )

RONALD (CONTD)
Wait until you’re on your own in the world with
real responsibilities You have to be able to
balance it We talked about this- If it’s too
much then you can forget about seeing friends
anymore or that little girl you run around with-

Tyler shakes his head

RONALD (CONTD)
Don’t shake your head at me- chump This is my
house You don’t like how I run things you can
get out I told you that you didn’t have to
work for me or train with me You asked for
that That was your choice I didn’t make you
choose wrestling- But if you’re gonna do
something you’re gonna do it right And I’1l
ride your ass everyday till you are delivered
into your excellence- if that’s what it takes
You don’t like it- quit Find a job like
everyone else or train on your own but you’re
not gonna sit around here and do mediocre work
because you cannot afford to

Ronald reads Tyler for a beat and decides to change his tone

RONALD (CONTD)

Look Everything I do is for y’all
Everything I only want the best for you
son I’m trying to give you the tools to
succeed in this world It’s not easy out there
Trust me Ive said it before and Ill say it
again- the world does not give a shit about you
and me We’re not afforded the luxury of being
average Gotta be 10 times better just to get

anywhere I don’t push you because I want to
I push you because I have to You hear what I’m
saying

Tyler nods and seems to genuinely take in his father’s words even
if he’s heard them a million times before

RONALD (CONTD)
Yeah

TYLER
Yeah I hear you

RONALD
Good Good Man I look at y’all and all the
opportunities you have that I didn’t wishing
Nana and Three Papa did for us Don’t even know
how good you have it

Ronald stands and leaves Tyler just sits and thinks about his
father’s words

INT HIGHSCHOOL GYM - LATER

Tyler is at a new wrestling match warming up as lighter weight
classes wrestle Tyler looks into the stands and sees his dad in
the front talking it up with all the parents Soon Catherine
arrives

Tyler steps up to the mat Tyler’s opponent arrives and he looks
tougher than the last kid Tyler shakes hands with his opponent and
they take the neutral position

The ref blows his WHISTLE Tyler and his opponent circle each other
until they latch onto each other’s necks with a firm grip Tyler
throws his opponent’s head around taking out his aggression until

BOOM

Tyler does a fast fireman’s carry and slams his opponent to the
ground Tyler keeps him wrapped up after the takedown and he’s
already trying to pin him This is pulling on Tyler’s shoulder like
crazy as the pain goes from intense to excruciating It’s too much
to take Tyler lets go and his opponent gets loose Tyler stands and
returns to the neutral position

BOOM

Tyler’s opponent gets Tyler in a single leg takedown and takes Tyler
to the ground ‘Je vous hais petites filles’ by M83 begins to seep in

Tyler scrambles but his opponent rides him Both of Tyler’s shoulders
are stretched overhead for support The pain flows as Tyler continues
to try and get loose The ref’s WHISTLE blows - the period ends

Pain is shooting up Tyler’s entire arm as he goes down to take the
defensive starting position Ronald and Catherine yell from the
stands Tyler’s opponent gets on top

The ref’s WHISTLE blows and period two begins Tyler stands to get
free but his opponent slams him back to the ground This continues
for a good minute Finally Tyler is able to stand and get loose

BOOM

Tyler is slammed to the ground with a double leg take down When they
hit the ground Tyler’s shoulder is stretched out and over his head

On impact the pain is so unbearable that Tyler can barely move
Everything goes to SLOW MOTION as Tyler’s opponent wraps him up and
goes for the pin Tyler tries to fight back Tyler looks up and
sees Coach Wise and the team yelling from the bench His parents
yelling from the bleachers

BAM
The ref hits the mat Tyler has lost Tyler’s opponent gets up to

claim victory Tyler tries to get up but he can’t He lays down
unable to move his shoulder The pain is unbearable

hands through his hair like she did when Tyler was a child
Ronald is just walking around looking incredibly frustrated

INT TYLER’S BATHROOM - LATER

Tyler takes pain killers and looks at his reflection in the mirror
There is a big ice pack wrapped around his shoulder and he is in a
sling

Finally sound is coming back and the music is fading out Tyler
listens and he can hear arguing in the distance Tyler leaves his
room and walks to the top of the stairs to listen

RONALD (0S)
I can’t believe he didn’t tell us I
don’t know what the hell he was thinking

CATHERINE (0S) RONALD (0S) (CONTD)

because Tyler wanted to tell He’s been lying this whole
us personally- time It’s his attitude I’m
telling you- The boy doesn’t
Watch your voice listen-

Frustration and isolation build in Tyler as he listens

holding onto big pain but keeping it at bay

see her mother’s face

There is total silence in the car with an awful energy Everyone is
in nice clothes like they are going to an event that requires formal
wear but they look exhausted and beaten down It feels like a good
chunk of time has passed since we last saw everyone

Emily watches as Ronald takes his hand and puts it on top of
Catherine’s for support He holds her hand for only a moment
before she pulls away Emily studies Ronald’s profile He looks
hurt but has clearly accepted this distance

ELENA (0C)
I remember every Sunday I used to go into
Alexis’s room and wake her up One thing that
never changed from the time she was a little
girl until the time she was a young woman was
the look on her face when she woke up in the
morning As soon as she opened her eyes I
could instantly see so much light and love A
face so excited to wake up and start the rest of
her life I’1l never forget the last time I saw
my baby’s face I almost didn’t even recognize
my own daughter

ELENA (0C) (CONTD)
Losing your child is a nightmare I wish on no

lost a grandchild

When I think about how Alexis died the
horror of it is overwhelming It is an all-

consuming horror which I constantly relive I
feel physically and emotionally exhausted As a
father I wasn’t able to help my baby girl My
daughter’s killer sits here before us today You
can see his face but you can’t see Alexis’s
You can’t see the fear that she must’ve had You
cannot imagine the pain that she must’ve felt
and the pain that my family feels today

We hold on the back of Tyler’s head He is silent still and
lifeless

cold and lifeless

looks away There is a clear unspoken tension between them and

LUKE (CONTD)
It’s cause I hate him He’s a piece of shit
with cancer

EMILY
What He has cancer

LUKE
He had it coming Trust me He’s just not a
part of my life anymore Half the time he
was drunk or on some kind of drugs One
time he pawned all the furniture in our
house When I was a kid after they were
split I saw him beat my mom just because
she wanted to take me to her family for
Christmas I saw him break her arm and pull
her by her fucking hair to throw her out of
the apartment And I was just a kid so I
couldn’t do anything

EMILY LUKE (CONTD)

Oh my god- It was terrifying After
that I had to have
supervised visits with him
Then he was good until he
fell off again and he always
did Eventually my mom cut
off our relationship

EMILY (CONTD)
When was the last time you talked to him

LUKE
I don’t know Like 8 years ago or
something

EMILY

Are you gonna talk to him

It’s okay My stepmom is really my mom She’s the
one that raised us at least We only saw our

biological mom when we were kids then she just
abandoned us I found out she died a few years
ago She had been writing me letters and calling
me to try and get in touch again too I just
ignored her I remember she tried to call me the
day before she died and I didn’t pick up I
think about that a lot Like if I just would’ve
answered my stupid phone maybe she’d still be

alive
LUKE
You can’t do that to yourself
EMILY
She was never there for us so why did she expect
me to be there for her She was like your

dad though- An addict When she overdosed my
dad didn’t want to claim her body or pay for a
service or anything and she didn’t die in Florida
so I couldn’t do anything even if I wanted to
It just sucks I don’t even know what happened to
her body

LUKE
Shit

EMILY
So I know how you feel but I still wish I
wouldve talked to my mom before it was too

late
LUKE EMILY (CONTD)

the intense pain they’ve felt Ronald looks off over the water
Clearly more on his mind

Tears flow down Emily’s face as pain and regret come to the surface

swallow you up It’1ll swallow you It’1ll swallow
you like it did your brother and you are not

Lord knows I’ve held on to too much hate
myself I think about your brother everyday
Things I could’ve done But we can’t change
it All we have is now and I’m telling you
this because I love you- Holding on to so much
hate will destroy a person and I’m not about to
let it destroy you You have so much love to
give to this world and you have so much life to
live You remember some of Papa’s favorite
scripture

dizzying 360 that reminds us of Alexis and Tyler

Emily and Luke are having a blast as they sing to the music pump each
other up and play around

And the other side of the loop is a loop
This is not my life
It’s just a fond farewell to a friend

INT NORTH FLORIDA TOURIST AREA - LATER THAT DAY

theme park with the CAMERA running behind to catch up They ride
the Orlando Eye and watch mermaids perform underwater

They go through a skeleton museum with skeletons of all kinds of
animals and insects They walk through an aquarium filled with
underwater life and color

EXT NORTH FLORIDA BEACH —- DAY

The music cuts out and we hear the sound of waves as we are in the
ocean underwater Emily is just floating through the water with her
eyes closed She is totally still and looks lifeless

All of a sudden Emily screams into the CAMERA and we rise above
water with her Emily and Luke laugh as they play through the waves on
the beach Emily and Luke walk along the beach and look for
different shells Emily watches a little girl play in the waves with
her mom Luke turns to see a small wedding being set up Some wood
posts with a veil no more than six chairs and a steel drum player
It’s an extremely tiny venue but cute Soon the bride and groom
walk the sand aisle and the wedding begins Luke and Emily watch from

their beach towels Score beings to build and take over

the landscapes shift as they cross different state lines From
Georgia to Atlanta and Nashville We see Emily and Luke in a
variety of different places Gas stations antique stores etc They
buy sunflower seeds Red Bull chips and condoms They go through
an antique store and see old pictures jewelry and paintings An
older white couple who seem to run the store stare at Emily and Luke
several beats too long They fill up at a variety of gas stations
They watch fireworks go off in a field Emily drives while Luke
tries to go down on her

Soon it’s night time and Emily and Luke are cuddled up in the back
seat trying to sleep Later We see a sunrise in fog deers
running Then it’s sunset and Emily watches Luke hang his hand out
the window Luke’s hand goes up and down through the wind like waves

Soon Emily’s car drives past a sign “Welcome to Missouri”

higher Emily studies Luke as he looks more and more nervous The

they head down another hallway Emily wraps her hand around Lukes

Soon they are outside of room 709 Emily goes to open the door

LUKE (CONTD)

Emily stops as Luke bends down into the wall He looks like he’s
on the verge of a mini panic attack

EMILY LUKE (CONTD)
Are you okay Want me to get No- no Just wait
a nurse or-

Luke breathes heavy as Emily rubs his back

EMILY (CONTD)
It’s okay Everything’s gonna be
okay He can’t hurt you anymore

Luke’s breathing begins to steady from Emily’s support He stands
back up and regains control Luke nods and then heads for the door

NOTE This will all be one unbroken take From the time they
enter the hospital until now

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Luke enters the room and he’s instantly stunned He sees his dad for
the first time in 8 years and it’s not what he expected Luke’s dad is
sitting back in a hospital bed He’s so skinny and depleted that he
looks incredibly fragile like an old man on his death bed It’s
devastating to see someone so close to death yet still grasping for
life All those years of pent up pain fear and animosity seem to
vanish from Luke This is not the “ asshole “ he remembers

LUKE’S FATHER
Son

LUKE
Hey dad

Luke walks over to his dad’s hospital bed Luke’s father struggles
forward and opens his arms for a hug Luke returns the hug and
wraps his arms around his father to feel his fragile frame Luke’s
father speaks in hushed tones because it’s hard to talk

LUKE’S FATHER
My son My son I missed you

LUKE
I missed you too

Luke and his dad cry a bit and hug each other for a good minute before

sleep but Luke’s eyes are open mind racing

EMILY LUKE
Please- At least try to I can’t turn my mind off
sleep

EMILY (CONTD)
- What are you thinking about

LUKE EMILY (CONTD)
- My dad giving me baths- That’s a little weird babe

LUKE (CONTD)
Oh hush I mean when I was a kid It’s
something that always stayed with me
He’d always hold my head back and pour
the water through my hair It’s stupid
but I don’t know I just remember feeling
happy Peace

EMILY
Give me a kiss

Luke kisses Emily

EMILY (CONTD)

runs her hands through his hair Luke slowly closes his eyes

Luke’s father vomits some dark mucus into a bucket It’s awful and
looks incredibly painful

DISSOLVE TO

DOCTOR LUKE
- Well he’s fighting Is this normal though

DOCTOR (CONTD)
Depends Everyone is different It can be
rapid or it can take time However this is
longer than usual and longer than what we had
anticipated Clearly he’s not ready to go
yet The best thing you can do is help him
feel peace and comfort when he is lucid

LUKE
Okay

DOCTOR
Alright Well just let us know if you need
anything and I’ll be back tomorrow to check in

LUKE

DISSOLVE TO

Emily’s eyes open She is sleeping with Luke in the visitor’s bed
and she can see Luke’s father staring at her He’s on the edge of his
bed and moaning in agonizing pain Luke’s father is hard to see in
the darkness and he nearly looks like a zombie It’s a sad
disturbing sight Emily wakes Luke up

LUKE (CONTD)
- Dad You okay Do you have to use the
bathroom

Luke helps his father to the bathroom
Emily rolls over and looks at her phone to see new text messages

DISSOLVE TO
Emily sits by the window and watches Luke with his dad Luke’s
father finishes vomiting some dark mucus into his bucket He looks

like he’s in agonizing pain

LUKE
You want some water

Luke’s father shakes his head

LUKE (CONTD)

- What are you holding onto dad What are
you feeling Is it just the pain or is it
something else

Luke’s father looks out the window to avoid eye contact with his son
It’s clear he’s holding on to so much and doesn’t wanna face it

LUKE (CONTD)
Is it something going on in your head If
it is you just need to let it go dad Okay I
love you I just want you at peace You don’t
need to fight Okay There’s no need to fight
Youre going some place better Right

LUKES FATHER
I know

Luke’s father moves his vomit bucket to the side So it’s not between
him and his son

LUKE
You don’t have any regret do you
That’s the magic word Luke’s father begins to break

LUKE’S FATHER

Kinda
LUKE
Well you don’t need to You don’t need
to Okay

Luke’s father hangs his head down and lets out a heartbreaking moan
We hear him release all the pain hurt and regret that’s been pent up
forever It’s devastating

LUKE (CONTD)
It’s okay

Luke’s father lets out another soul-crushing moan

LUKE (CONTD)
Just let it all go

We hold on Emily as she takes in everything Emily closes her
eyes Images of Tyler rush through Emily’s mind Emily thinks of
the last time Tyler broke down to her in their bathroom Tears
begin to fall from Emily’s face as she thinks of Tyler

Luke’s father lets out a quieter moan and Luke holds him Luke and
his father lean up and look each other in the eyes

LUKE (CONTD)
Just let it all go Okay

Luke’s father nods A piece of score like ‘Burial’ by Mica Levi

gaining speed as her neighborhood flies past her and she pushes
forward

The music continues to build

Soon Emily stops pedaling and she just glides

Emily takes her hands off the handle bars and rests them by her
side Emily stretches her arms up into the air She lets the
wind rush through her finger tips then her entire body We hold

on Emily’s face as tears begin to fall and a big smile forms
She has a happy cry She is free She feels alive

Emily thinks to herself Everything she’s been through All
the tragedy she’s experienced All the beauty too It’s all
one and we’re all connected That’s life and it’s beautiful

The music continues to build as we PUSH IN behind Emily with her
hands in the air She looks like she is flying

Colors fill the screen
The same that we saw at the beginning and middle of the film

Now they are all combined and flow in and out of each other in one
cosmic glow
