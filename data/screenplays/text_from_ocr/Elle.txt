INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - HALLWAY -- DAY 1

The eyes of MARTY a cat indifferently observe some rather
noisy struggle Male GRUNTS A woman’s SMOTHERED SCREAMS The
SHATTERING of glass After a few moments the cat gets bored
and wanders away

Looking down a tastefully decorated hallway a MALE FIGURE
rises into view He cleans his genital area with a scrap of
fabric - torn panties though from this ANGLE it’s hard to
make that out clearly He drops the cloth contemptuously on
the floor and walks toward us He straightens the black ski-
mask he wears over his face as he clears the frame PUSHING
DOWN the hall discover MICHELLE LEBLANC lying on the floor
Face down skirt hiked up above her waist There’s a little
blood on her legs and on the rug

At first it seems she might be dead but she’s just in
shock Her limbs begin to move slowly clumsily As if her
brain were having trouble communicating with the rest of her

She stands Her breasts are exposed where her bra has been
pulled up Her torn dress exposes an old cesarian scar She
pulls her bra down holds her dress closed She notes a
fallen but unbroken vase on the carpet She returns it to its
proper place on an end-table

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 2
Michelle sweeps up a broken crystal ash tray with a broom and
dust-pan Her movements very deliberate as if she were on
auto-pilot

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS BATHROOM -- DAY 3
Michelle peels herself out of her ruined dress She shoves it
very deliberately into a waste-basket

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 4
In the tub Michelle takes an inventory of injuries A few
bruises and minor abrasions She sees a curlicue of blood
floating in the soapy water She erases it with her hand
INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- DAY 5

Wearing a bathrobe hair still wet Michelle sits on her bed
phone in one hand a Sushi take-out menu in the other

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- DAY 5

Wearing a bathrobe hair still wet Michelle sits on her bed
phone in one hand a Sushi take-out menu in the other
MICHELLE (INTO PHONE)
-Yes Id like two pieces of the
Hamachi as well and what
exactly is the “Holiday Roll”

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - ENTRYWAY -- DAY 6

Michelle opens her front door and lets in her 19-year-old
son VINCENT a bear of a young man with scrappy facial hair
a back-pack on his shoulder She greets him with a brief hug

VINCENT
I know I’m late They kept me at
work a fucking extra hour
(walking on with her he
sees something’s amiss)
Are you ok You look like you got a
black eye starting

MICHELLE
I fell off my bike

VINCENT
That bike

The young man nods to a brand new-looking bike they’re
passing leaned against the entryway wall

VINCENT (CONT’D)
It doesn’t look like you’ve been
riding it at all

MICHELLE
(gestures to her face)
And you see why

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- DEN -- LATER 7

They’re sitting at the coffee table eating Sushi Vincent
uses the chopsticks in conjunction with his fingers Michelle
isn’t eating at the moment she’s watching his Iphone (We
glimpse a Youtube snippet a child at Sea World) Vincent
watches his mother expecting a big laugh But as the video
ends Michelle looks merely confused

MICHELLE
So the kid was scared of the
penguin

VINCENT

The music’s what makes it so great
MICHELLE
It’s arguably cruelty to animals

VINCENT
Nah- you think
(takes back his phone)
Sorry I was late We’re short-
handed at work

MICHELLE
You’ve managed to avoid mentioning
what this job actually is

VINCENT
ts entry level I told you But
there’s a path to management I’m
like an assistant manager

MICHELLE
s this a MacDonald’s or something

VINCENT
(amazed she guessed)
But it’s a management position Like
said I brought you a present

Quickly changing the subject Vincent hops up pulls
gift box from his back-pack with great pride

VINCENT (CONT’D)
It’s from Josie really It was all
her idea

a gold

Michelle smiles thinly She opens the box Inside a FRAMED
PHOTO Vincent is stiffly posed before a cheesy back-drop

beside a massively pregnant girl (JOSIE)

MICHELLE
You look quite handsome

VINCENT
Were going to go back and take
another picture after the babys

born You can put ‘em side by side

Itll be like a before and after

He moves a candle stick on the mantle to the side to

room for the photo

VINCENT (CONT’D)
Josies got all kinds of ideas
about interior decorating Of
course shes never had her own
place to decorate Till now

make
Michelle lowers her head knowing where this is going

VINCENT (CONT’D)
Shell be able to try her hand a
little bit I guess now that were
getting our own place

She watches him sit back down going back to eating Sushi

using the chopsticks in conjunction with his fingers

MICHELLE
How much are you going to need for
this new apartment

VINCENT
I didnt ask you for money

MICHELLE
Did I jump the gun

VINCENT
I was going to ask you to co-sign
the lease but I wasnt going to ask
you for money necessarily

MICHELLE
Are any of Josies other paramours
moving in with you too

VINCENT
No

(realizing that came off
like an answer respecting
the question)

No Why would you say something
like that

Vincent spills some Wasabi on his lap Michelle gets up to

get him another napkin

MICHELLE
You dont know anything about this
manifestly dysfunctional girl
Except that she was raised by
unwashed idiots in a commune

VINCENT
It was an Arts collective

In passing Michelle moves the candlestick back in front
the photo

of
MICHELLE
She didn’t see toilet paper until
she was ten By her own admission

She returns to her chair gives him the napkin

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
I suppose it’s progress she now
suddenly wants the most bourgeois
life imaginable- you’ve really
never wondered about this Why she
glommed onto you What she’s after

VINCENT
(cleaning himself up)
What could she be “after” I dont
have money

MICHELLE
I do

VINCENT
You know I cant listen to this
Youre insulting my family

MICHELLE
(hands him napkin)
Your father sets his jaw just like
that when hes laying down the law
t doesnt work for you yet Give
it some time

VINCENT
(hurt embarrassed)
dont know whats with you today

She looks at him thinking about telling him Then

MICHELLE
‘11 give you three months rent On
condition I look at the place
first

VINCENT
didn’t want to pressure you If
you really don’t feel

MICHELLE
You won When you strike oil stop
drilling

Vincent smiles goes back to eating sushi ditching the
chopsticks Michelle watches him with a slight smile

EXT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- NIGHT 8

Michelle waves goodbye to Vincent as he drives away Far down
the street a few Xmas lights twinkle

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - GARAGE -- NIGHT 9

Michelle rummages through a tool box until she finds a HAMMER

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT 10
Michelle makes a sweep of the house holding the hammer She

concernedly checks the pantry door It’s slightly warped so
it takes an extra shove to close it all the way

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - BEDROOM -- LATER THAT NIGHT 11

Michelle is asleep in the light of her TV the hammer on the
pillow next to her

INT OFFICES OF A-V SOFTWARE -- DAY 12

Immaculately dressed for power Michelle strides past
cubicles filled with busy employees side by side with ANNA
her Co-CEO a well-put together woman her own age

ANNA
Have you seen this apartment
Vincent picked out

MICHELLE
Six months ago he was dealing weed
and getting into imbecilic fights
now hes a family man

ANNA
That bitch JOSIE is a menace He
just doesnt see it

INT A-V SOFTWARE - CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY 13

The group is watching a highly polished GAME DEMO projected
at the front of the room software engineer PHILLIP KWAN
acting as the player On the screen a Lovecraftian
creaturess tentacle penetrates the skull of a helplessly
writhing woman She stops struggling as her eyes turn black
MICHELLE
Phillip werent we going to dial
back the orgasmic convulsions
though

ANNA
These guys never heard of subtext
Michelle smiles There are some
murmurs from others at the table

PHILLIP
(defensive)
There was forty-five seconds of
animation on that originally

KURT
Are we not going to address the
white elephant in the room

KURT a German-born game designer with long hair and many
tattoos now stands and takes the floor

KURT (CONTD)
We get one shot at Activision but
the wonkiness of the controls make
this critical demonstration tool
almost unplayable It doesnt
matter how intricately rendered the
environments of Thule are if the
players throwing his controller
through the fucking screen

MICHELLE
It seems to me youre dodging the
issue by blaming known glitches

KURT
Im confronting the issue head-on
The issue is you come from the
world of publishing and literary
fiction and thats a singularly
inappropriate background for
evaluating playability
Everyone in the room looks a little
shocked he said this Michelle
takes it in stride

MICHELLE
It may well be that Anna and I
should have founded a different
sort of company

(MORE )

MICHELLE (CONTD)
It may be as you suspect that
Kronos was a hit solely because of
your innovations and were bitches
who got lucky - but the fact is I
am the boss and were six months
behind here
(to all as Kurt seethes)
We all know the goal when the
player guts an Orc he has to feel
hot blood pouring over his hands
Kevin a cherubic red-haired young
man turns to Michelle

KEVIN
I love you

Everybody laughs Even Michelle
smiles

INT AV OFFICES - OUTER OFFICE -- DAY

Michelle and Anna walk together toward the elevators

MICHELLE
Sometimes I think Kurt hates me

ANNA
He does hate you They all hate
you Except Kevin- who really does
love you even though he tries to
pass it off as a joke This isn’t
a shock You knew all this right

Michelle shrugs They share a little laugh

INT A DOCTORS OFFICE -- DAY

A NURSE draws blood Michelle wears a lime-green gown She
turns to the young DOCTOR making notes in her chart nearby

MICHELLE
Does she know I want a full STD
panel

DOCTOR

Yes she does
(smiles briefly)

If you’re concerned about a recent

exposure I can prescribe a PEP

MICHELLE
I googled those They have nasty
side effects and I can’t miss any
work So I guess I’1ll just have to
roll the dice

The Doctor disapproves but Michelle starts getting dressed

INT A CAFE -- DAY 16

Michelle looks over creature design sketches Her phone
RINGS She answers A MALE VOICE (ROBERT) on the other end-

MAN (0S)
My evening just cleared up

MICHELLE (INTO PHONE)
It’s not good for me Actually
Im having Female Difficulties

MAN (0S)
I’1l wear a condom

MICHELLE (INTO PHONE)
I appreciate your willingness to
sacrifice but tonight’s not good

As Michelle returns to her drawings another cafe patron a
big grey-haired WOMAN keeps throwing funny looks Michelles
way Angry looks Now the woman rises from her table with her
tray and on her way out makes a detour over to Michelles
table She proceeds to deliberately spill the contents of her
tray - half-eaten food and paper products - right into
Michelles lap Michelle strangely takes it completely in
stride She doesnt even act all that surprised

The woman glaring at Michelle sets her tray down and walks
out Michelle dabs a napkin in water scrubs her blouse

INT MICHELLE’S MOTHER’S APARTMENT -- DAY 17

Michelle lets herself in Shes surprised to discover her
mother IRENE having coffee in the breakfast nook with a
gigolo-esque guy in early middle age (RAFE) The man wears a
dress shirt and boxer shorts

Michelle sighs heavily and shakes her head Her mother a
woman in her late 70s with layers of plastic surgery shows
mild annoyance

IRENE
If you’re going to come in without
knocking you’re going to be
treated to gruesome sights like me
having coffee with a friend

RAFE
But I did wish I had pants on

The gigolo excuses himself smiling Michelle glares at him

MICHELLE
How much do you pay them So
demeaning

IRENE

I have nothing to be ashamed of
This is my life My sex life
Youre just a little bitch

MICHELLE
All Im saying is you’re on a fixed
income You should be more
economical Do you really need a
young stud at your age

IRENE
Did you eat I made spaghetti

MICHELLE
I’ll take some coffee

Irene goes to get it as Michelle sits down at the table

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
Did you have more work done

IRENE
You’re just going to keep going

MICHELLE
I’m sorry

Irene brings over the coffee

IRENE
A little Botox

MICHELLE
It’s your business
(sips her coffee)
Very good
IRENE
You act surprised

Rafe comes back in fully dressed

RAFE

Well that’s better Michelle I
hope we get a chance to meet
properly soon I have to take off

IRENE
Not yet you’re not

She slinks over to him sexy for a lovers’ goodbye kiss

Michelle openly disgusted has to look away

MICHELLE
Did my mother tell you she’s HIV
positive

IRENE
I already warned him you were going
to try that one

Michelle shrugs Rafe smiles at her

RAFE
Nice meeting you

He takes off Irene returns to the table

IRENE
I’m going to ask you a question I
want you to think before you
answer What would you say if I
remarried Think about it

MICHELLE
It’s simple- I’d kill you No need
to think about it

Irene shakes her head lights a cigarette
IRENE

Youve always wanted some sanitized
version of life Michelle

MICHELLE
I would kill you You asked I told
you

IRENE

Youre so selfish Michelle It’s
frightening

MICHELLE
I know Here’s the check for your
mortgage payment by the way

Michelle takes a check from her purse hands it over

IRENE
You never give anything truly of
yourself Like with your father
How much effort would it take

MICHELLE
Don’t

IRENE
He’s an old man Michelle

MICHELLE
Well he’s still breathing so not
old enough apparently

IRENE
There’s are some connections that
can never be broken

MICHELLE
I walk through the door here

IRENE
--Never No matter what

MICHELLE
-and it’s one horror after another

IRENE
He’s having another parole hearing
next week

MICHELLE
Enough OK

Irene looks hurt Michelle sips her coffee notices something
by her chair She holds it up

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
Your stud forgot his hernia belt
EXT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- DUSK 18
Getting groceries out of her car Michelle is politely

accosted by her neighbor REBECCA a very pretty large-
bosomed woman in her mid-30s Conservatively dressed perky

REBECCA
Michelle glad I caught you I’m
putting these on everybody’s door
(presses a Flyer in
Michelle’s hand)
Its about the neighborhood
coucils new trash-separation
policy

MICHELLE
Oh thank you

Rebecca’s handsome husband PATRICK - a man with the look of
a high school quarterback just starting to go to seed - is
wrestling a large Xmas creche out of his car’s hatch-back

REBECCA
Theyre levying a pretty steep fine
now if recycleables arent properly
sorted and were having a block
meeting Wednesday to organize our
opposition

MICHELLE
But youre on the council arent
you

PATRICK
Ive tried to point that out to her
that its hard to be we and
they at the same time

MICHELLE
Its an interesting position
anyway

REBECCA

Thats how I like to look at it

Michelle smiles politely and finds herself sharing an amused
little look with the man carrying the creche She gives
Rebecca another smile and tosses the flyer in the car before
she shuts the door

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- NIGHT 19
Michelle comes in A LOCKSMITH works on the front door
LOCKSMITH

This is the last one Your new set
of keys is there on the table

MICHELLE
Great Thank you Did you notice
the side door doesn’t close properly

LOCKSMITH
The wood’s warped Might be
possible to shim under the hinge
plates fix it that way

MICHELLE
Oh

LOCKSMITH
I don’t do that I just do locks

Michelle nods Of course

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- LATER THAT NIGHT 20

Michelle sits on her stairs absently stroking Marty the cat
staring at the entry hall where the rape took place

FLASHBACK TO- INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- DAY 21

Michelle is walking through the living room with a cup of
coffee She hears the cat loudly WHINING She follows the
sound and sees that the pantry door is standing slightly

ajar Michelle puts down her coffee and goes out onto the
side patio to retrieve the cat Marty jumps into her arms

MICHELLE
Howd you get out there numbskull

Michelle tries to close the door but finds she’s having
trouble The weather-warped door won’t close properly She’s
in the middle of her third attempt when the door suddenly
bursts inward knocking her back making her drop the cat

A MASKED INTRUDER now steps into the house Eyeing her
flings the door closed behind him

For a moment Michelle is frozen by terror Then the Intruder
takes a step toward her and she rediscovers her legs She
runs but the Intruder catches up to her in the hall She’s no
physical match for the much bigger man and soon all she can
do is keep screaming as the Intruder takes her Marty
watching on an indifferent witness

BACK TO- INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- NIGHT 22

Michelle closes her eyes opens them Like a ritual purging
She holds up the cat makes him looks at her

MICHELLE
If you couldn’t claw his eyes out
you couldve at least scratched
him I’m just saying

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - STUDY -- NIGHT 23

Michelle is looking at a preliminary animation on her laptop
More Lovecraftian monsters She gets a TEXT MESSAGE

She looks at her phone Unknown caller

Just as she’s about to retrieve the message her phone dies
She curses to herself as she has to get up and plug in her
charger It takes a moment for the phone to reboot

When it does she finds an ominous message staring at her
“You were tight for a woman your age”

Michelle feels ice water down her spine She moves to the
window looks out A few more Xmas lights twinkle in the
street but nothing stirs

INT GUN SHOP -- DAY 24

Michelle talks with an orange-vested SALES ASSOCIATE in front
of a case filled with PEPPER SPRAYS She’s handling one

MICHELLE
So this is the most powerful

SALES ASSOCIATE
With pepper sprays power can be
measured in terms of potency and in
terms of distance

MICHELLE
I want both
INT GUN SHOP -- MOMENTS LATER 25

On her way to the checkout counter Michelle passes a display
of HATCHETS She tosses one of those in her basket too

EXT STREET -- DUSK

Michelle can’t find a parking space She attempts a parallel
parking job anyway backing in hard Her rear bumper makes an
audible CRUNCH She keeps going anyway forcibly moving the
other car to make room for hers

INT RESTAURANT -- DUSK

Entering Michelle finds RICHARD her ex a ruggedly handsome
man around fifty already here They kiss

RICHARD
You want to sit outside We can sit

RICHAR

D

struggling

RI

CHAR

D

She is a psycho I will add
though that kind of girl is often
very good in bed

She nods back to him

Richard

The Hostess smiles to herself as she opens napkins for them

MICHELLE
What does that mean anyway “Good
in bed” I’ve never known

The Hostess splits Michelle sits down

RICHARD
Did you get a chance to read my
proposal yet

Michelle seems distracted as she settles in at the table

MICHELLE
Richard would you say I was tight
for a woman my age

Richards taken aback by the question Before he can answer

they’re joined by Anna and her husband ROBERT

ROBERT
What up loser

INT RESTAURANT -- DUSK

RICHARD
(amid the hugs kisses)
Youre just in time to hear
Michelle avoid telling me what she
thought of the game idea I pitched

to her
MICHELLE
No - it was very interesting
ROBERT
(to Bus Boy)
Four glasses of champagne no a

bottle

Anna sits next to Michelle She can tell there’s something
wrong She mouths “are you ok” Michelle half-smiles
distantly

RICHARD
It is interesting Its set ina
time when dogs have been wiped out
by a virus so people have robotic
canines as pets You play as the
Spartacus of the robot-dog world

Bob fakes being impressed Michelle makes a sound as if she
were going to speak but then clams up All look at her

MICHELLE
I was trying to I was going to
try to find a way to segue into
this organically but there really
is no graceful way so I’m just
going to dump it on the table I
was assaulted a couple of days ago
In my home I guess I was raped

ANNA
Oh my god
RICHARD
Raped
ANNA
Oh my God
ROBERT
Seriously
RICHARD
A couple of days ago
MICHELLE
Thursday Night
RICHARD
You dont say anything
ANNA
Oh my God
MICHELLE
I really haven’t known what to
say What is there to say I feel

stupid now for bringing it up

RICHARD
Are you insane

The Waiter finally comes over
WAITER
Have we had time to look at the

menu

Robert looks at his menu as if they were actually going to
do that now but then he reads the table To the waiter-—
ROBERT
Give us a minute huh

The Waiter reads the table too and quickly withdraws

ROBERT (CONTD)
We’re talking about a real rape
here

ANNA
A real rape

ROBERT
She knows what I meant

ANNA
I don’t think you do

ROBERT
Don’t get political now Your
closest friend was just raped

Apparently You were For real
MICHELLE
It was real He wore a mask and
everything
RICHARD

Jesus Christ You’re telling us
this now

MICHELLE
Im telling you now

No one knows what to say A moment of silence

ANNA
Are you alright You have to get a
medical exam

MICHELLE
I took care of all that I gota
full blood panel

RICHARD
What have the cops told you
(off her look)
You havent reported this

ANNA
Michelle you have to report this
to the police Immediately

MICHELLE
Why

ANNA
Why

MICHELLE

It’s over It doesn’t need to be
talked about anymore It doesn’t
need to be commemorated in any
way Let’s order something
Anything

EXT RESTAURANT -- NIGHT 29

A grim Richard walks out with Michelle They exchange solemn
waves with Anna and Robert going off the other way

RICHARD
Where’s your car

She nods the way They walk in silence a moment
RICHARD (CONTD)

If you’re reluctant to go to the
police because

MICHELLE

Of course I’m reluctant to go to
the police because I’m never
dealing with police ever again
That was my vow

This seems to make sense to him for some reason

RICHARD
‘m going to get you a gun

MICHELLE
dont believe in guns
(cutting him off)
Richard I should tell you I shared
your proposal with our financiers
They weren’t interested

RICHARD
don’t want to talk about that
now
MICHELLE
Alright

She opens her car door with her key

RICHARD
But I guess now I might as well ask
what you thought of it

MICHELLE
Don’t take it hard It doesn’t have
anything to do with the quality of
your work It’s a business that’s
very tied into a particular
demographic

RICHARD
A demographic that doesn’t care if
something’s good

MICHELLE
Pretty much

RICHARD
You don’t have to shield me
Really what did you think of it

MICHELLE
I think you should finish your
novel You’re a real writer

RICHARD
A penniless real writer

He stops noticing her color paint on his front bumper
MICHELLE

Looks like somebody dented your
fender

RICHARD
(smiling)
If I get my hands on the punk

Michelle gives him a smile and kiss gets in her car

EXT MCDONALD’S -- DAY 30

Michelle pulls up Vincent emerges from the interior in his
McDonalds uniform carrying a McFlurry - which he hands to
his mother as he climbs in

VINCENT
On the house I made it myself

He seems proud of that Michelle smiles thanks

31 INT EMPTY APARTMENT -- DAY 31

A man in an impeccable suit opens the door for Michéle and
Vincent

MAN
Mrs Leblanc yes I am the
apartment manager Please come in

They follow him to the main room where an extremely pregnant
woman Josie is measuring a corner with a tape measure

JOSIE
Hello Michéle Vin could you hold
this for a moment

Vincent takes the end of the tape measure Josie stretches it
out

JOSIE (CONTD)
The bookcase is 150 centimeters
so there like that Can you
stand there so I can see

She positions Vincent so that he’s a stand-in for the book
case He’s contientously very still as she extends his arm

VINCENT
Right here

JOSIE
Don’t just act like the bookcase
Be the bookcase

She measures down from his extended arm to the floor

MICHELLE
(smiling)
Vincent is quite the actor When he
was 12 he was a model for “Kronos”
our first game

JOSIE
Ah And I’m sure you were great

She kisses him furtively and then again intensively Vincent -
in the presence of his mother - feels akward He makes a
grand gesture towards the room

VINCENT
Nice huh

MICHELLE
A little too nice dont you think

Vincent demeanor goes gloomy instantly Josie continues with
her measuring tape

JOSIE (TO VINCENT)
Theres room for a 50 inch here
Did you ask her

Michelle looks to Vincent Ask me what

VINCENT
You know how you were going to buy
us a microwave We were hoping
maybe you could save your money on
that and give us a tv as the
housewarming present instead

MICHELLE
Dont you need an oven more than a
new TV

JOSIE

(pausing to precisely

write down measurements)
The unit comes with a microwave a
refrigerator everything

MICHELLE
It does Is this the same apartment
you told me about

Vincent looks ashamed The manager speaks up-

APARTMENT MANAGER
No its not This is one of our
elite units This is 250 euros a
month more

JOSIE
(going back to measuring)
The other one there was ridiculous
There was nowhere to put a crib
even It was preposterous

MICHELLE
A little uncomfortable maybe

JOSIE
Yeah Uncomfortable

MICHELLE
You do realize having a child is
all about suffering

(MORE)

MICHELLE (CONTD)
When Vincent was born it was three
hours of torture before they gave
up and cut him out of me At that
point I wouldve gutted myself
with the jagged end of a broken
beer bottle to end the pain

Josie meets Michelles gaze flatly

JOSIE
If you dont want to help us dont
help us Nobodys holding a gun to
your head

MICHELLE
If I dont help you how are you
going to live

JOSIE
Thats our problem

MICHELLE
No- no you see you dont get to
do that You dont get to act
fiercely independent while taking
my money

JOSIE

None of this shit was my idea

(to Vincent)
I know you want to show off and
make all these big nice things
happen but Jesus at some point
you have to deliver right A
little Something Once It’s
always total bullshit Whatever way
things are going to be is never the
way they are

She chokes up throws down the tape measure and stalks away
Fuming impotently Vincent hits the wall

APARTMENT MANAGER
Hey hey hey

Vincent instantly turns from raging bear to shamed child

MICHELLE
This is impossible You realize
that Shes a lunatic and youre

VINCENT
What What am I Its like you

MICHELLE
(softening)
Ill cosign like I said I would but

rent between this apartment and the
one wed talked about

VINCENT
Absolutely Theres no problem Im
ready for this

Michelle knows better but she nods Vincent immediately goes
to Josie who’s crying in the next room He approaches her
gingerly

VINCENT (CONT’D)
It’s ok It’s done Everythings
going to be just how you want it

JOSIE
(her hands on her belly)
How I want it It’s not for me Do
you not understand anything It’s
not about me

Vincent looks frustrated He can’t do anything right Josie
sees his anguish instantly relents She hushes him takes
him in her arms Michelle - on her way out - watches through
the doorway as Josie strokes Vincent’s head maternally
Michelle looks fascinated

INT A-V OFFICES -- DAY 32

Michelle watches a group of kids shooting zombies Some kind
of beta-testing focus group As she moves on she sees Robert
coming down the corridor toward her

MICHELLE
You missed Anna She’s in
Anguouléme today

Robert smiles Michelle sighs internally seeing his smile

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
But you knew that

Michelle continues into her office He follows her in closes
the door behind them Michelle settles in behind her desk

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
You know I went through a very
traumatic experience days ago

ROBERT
You gave the impression you wanted
to go on like nothing happened
If I’m being insensitive I’m
sorry but that’s my thing right

MICHELLE
I appreciate you staying in
character

ROBERT
(comes closer)
And you know a big part of my
role is being unpredictable Don’t
scream

He unzips his pants whips it out Michelle sighs
ROBERT (CONTD)
I know you’re a wilting flower but
you can still touch it Can’t you

She looks up at him Sees he’s not going to be dissuaded

MICHELLE
Hold on

She reaches over and grabs her waste-basket Positions it to
catch his wayward sperm

INT A-V OFFICES -- NIGHT 33

The entire suite is dark and silent The only light is the
one in Michelle’s office

INT MICHELLE’S OFFICE -- NIGHT 34

Michelle is going over an intimidatingly numbers-heavy tech
review with a yellow highlighter The only sound is the hum
of the heating system Until her phone DINGS

A text message She glances at the clock 230 AM She looks
at her phone “Unknown Caller” She looks at the message

That cream blouse is lovely my cum stains will hardly show
See you soon

Michelle whips toward the window behind her Nothing out
there but the dark glass of another office building A
thought chills her and she looks at her door Her unlocked
door

She crosses to it hesitates then pulls the door open as if
expecting to surprise someone on the other side

INT OUTER OFFICES - CONTINUOUS 35

Michelle emerges slowly
silent suite of offices

She has a look around the dark
She seems to be alone but at the

end of a row of cubicles she sees a light spilling froma

half-open door marked “s
doorway Peering in she

tudio” She quietly sneaks up on that
sees Kurt in the light of a single

lamp posing a featureless doll and taking pictures

A figure study of some sort He doesn’t seem to notice

Michelle She decides no

t to announce herself and withdraws

EXT QUAI BESIDE THE SEINE -- DAY 36

Michelle and Irene rise from finishing their meal at one of

the little restaurants

MICHELLE
I was going to ask- have you
experienced any incidents recently

IRENE

Incidents

MICHELLE

You know what

I mean

IRENE

A man threw a
from his car

slice of pizza at me
It missed Also I felt

a couple of eyes on me in the market
perhaps But I always feel that

MICHELLE

I just wonder

if isn’t starting

again A new cycle

IRENE
You don’t know Tru Tv just made a
new “special documentary” about
your father They’re repeating it
all hours every day That’s why

it’s fresh on

people’s minds

MICHELLE

(reeling)
I didn’t know

I don’t watch TV

IRENE
Has something happened to you

MICHELLE
No Nothing really Just looks from
people on the street The usual

IRENE
It’s because of his parole hearing
That’s their excuse for dredging
the whole thing up again Your
father’s going before the panel in
two days

MICHELLE
You don’t miss a beat

IRENE
I want you to come with me

MICHELLE
They will never let him out Thank
God This parole hearing is nothing
but a kabuki exercise just like you
asking me to go with you when you
know I’d rather claw my own eyes out

IRENE
How long are you going to hang onto
this hatred

MICHELLE
I will never see him again Not in
this world or well there is no
other world so Ill just leave it
at that

IRENE
There isn’t much time left
Michelle He’s ill Look
(pulling a PHOTO from her
purse like a weapon)
Just look Are you afraid to look
at your own father

Michelle looks defiantly The photo is of an ordinary man
bald thin a bit stooped Wearing an orange prison jumpsuit

MICHELLE
There Put it away now

IRENE
You’re not like all the others
Michelle people who only know the
monster from TV You know the man
He’s just a man

MICHELLE
And he’s a monster You think
there’s a contradiction there
Look I’m done I’1ll see you later

Michelle walks off

IRENE
Just be careful Some people aren’t
content with throwing rude things
from passing cars

Michelle keeps walking By the time she reaches the street
where her car is parked Michelle’s already looking around a
little paranoid She clocks the faces of her fellow
pedestrians wondering which ones might mean her harm

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- DAY 37
Marty the Cat CRIES pitifully

MICHELLE (0S)
Howd you get out there numbskull

Michelle opens the pantry door scoops her cat in her arms

As she turns the Intruder is there in front of her He grabs
her Just as we’ve seen before but what we haven’t seen
before she gets her hands on the iron on the table next to
her Screaming she clobbers him The Intruder lets go of
her grabbing his head in pain That’s his fatal mistake
Michelle hits him again His blood sprays across the wall
Michelle an animal now falls on the Intruder bringing the
iron down Over and over screaming

CUT TO- INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - STUDY -- DAY 38
Michelle smiles to herself weakly She turns back to the
work on the desk in front of her Rotted faces - concept
drawings of zombies She considers a moment then circles the
zombie on the left

A loud THWACK startles her Makes the pen jump in her hand

Michelle grabs the hatchet - which apparently she keeps
near her at all times - and goes to check out the sound

Her heart skips a beat when she discovers a CRACK in her side
sliding glass door

She ducks back behind the wall peeks out cautiously and
now sees the injured BIRD that collided into the glass
twitching on the patio Thoroughly creeped-out Michelle puts
down her hatchet and fetches a broom She opens the sliding
door flicks the dying bird onto the grass then quickly
shuts it again as if afraid it were going to try to get in

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER 39

Michelle lights a cigarette A moment later she’s drawn back
to the sliding glass door To her horror she sees that the
bird is still alive and about to be devoured by Marty who is
sadistically toying with it Michelle rushes out with the
broom to shoo the cat away

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- LATER 40

Michelle holds the bird swaddled in a towel as she talks on
the phone with a VET

MICHELLE (INTO PHONE)
I understand you can’t make a
prognosis over the phone I was
just exploring whether in fact
treating birds was something that
was possible

VET (0S)
We’re talking about a wild bird

MICHELLE (INTO PHONE)
Yes An ordinary brown bird

VET (0S)
Like a sparrow

MICHELLE (INTO PHONE)
Sparrows are pretty aren’t they

VET (0S)
Well that’s subjective

MICHELLE (INTO PHONE)
Is it

VET (0S)
Honestly ma’am I wouldn’t even
know how to intubate a sparrow- or
whatever it is

Michelle mms She looks at the bird very still in her arms
but breathing rhythmically

MICHELLE (INTO PHONE)
Do sleeping pills work on birds

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN -- EVENING 41

Michelle grinds up sleeping pills and mixes them in a cup
with some Chia seeds

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - DEN -- NIGHT 42

Michelle watches TV The bird in its towel-swaddling rests
in her lap She absently strokes its head with her thumb As
she scrolls through channels something on her cable guide
catches her off-guard Bloodline the Legave Street Murders
Michelle’s remote hand stays tensely suspended in mid-air a
moment before she presses “OK”

A TV documentary faded footage of an improbably long line of
body bags on a suburban sidewalk what looks like a swastika
scrawled in blood on a door

NARRATOR (0S)
little knowing the horror that
unfolded or the questions that
they would be left to answer

Michelle braces for the next image a SLOW ZOOM-IN on an old
photo of a nondescript balding man with his arm around a
woman- who is clearly a younger version of Michelle’s mother

NARRATOR (CONT’D)
What would drive George Leblanc
successful entrepreneur alderman
at his local church loving husband
and father to commit such horrific
and senseless acts

The zoom PANS DOWN to the CHILD in Irene’s lap 10-YEAR-OLD
MICHELLE

NARRATOR (CONT’D)
A single night of madness that
would forever haunt those closest
to him

They cut to a much more recent Michelle - recognizable as
herself but less fashionable - being attacked by
PHOTOGRAPHERS in a parking lot

REPORTER (ON TV)
Have you talked to your father

She strikes the cameraman

NARRATOR (0S)
Decades of court proceedings and
psychiatric interviews have shed
but dim light on the events

Michelle dials down the volume but keeps the picture on as
the image DISSOLVES to another photo of herself as a child
In it she’s standing in front of a suburban house lit by
the flash of a news camera looking lost covered in ash like
a Dickensian chimney-sweep

As the documentary cuts to footage of some kind of memorial -
children tying red ribbons to the mail boxes of houses -
Michelle finally turns it off When she looks down she sees
that the bird in her lap is dead

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - PANTRY -- MOMENTS LATER 43

Michelle carefully places the dead bird in a shoe box

EXT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- NIGHT 44

Michelle takes the shoe box out to the trash cans There are
more Xmas lights now filling the street with gaudy color As
she closes the lid of the can from across the street-—

PATRICK
We have to stop meeting like this

Patrick is dragging his own trash can out to the curb
Michelle not wanting to get dragged into a corny running
joke with the neighbor gives a polite chuckle Waves

Heading back into the house Michelle notices a CAR gliding
down this quiet street It’s unfamiliar to her from the way
she watches it pass Just before Michelle reaches her front
door she sees the strange car very suspiciously turn off its
lights and make a U-turn Before parking in the dark across
the street

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 45
Michelle locks and bolts the door behind her She hurries to

the living room window Whoever is in the car is just sitting
there in the dark

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER 46

Michelle sits with her hatchet and her pepper spray as if
waiting for a showdown Nothing happens and nothing continues
to happen She can’t take it anymore She goes to the window

That suspicious car is still there A cigarette’s glow wax
and wanes behind the steering wheel

EXT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER 47

Michelle comes out the side door with a flashlight (not
turned on) and the pepper spray She hugs the side of the
house moving like a spy She darts to the cover of a tree
and from there across the street Keeping to the shadows
bent low she sneaks up on the stranger’s vehicle

She hesitates one second then rises up and charges She
breaks the driver’s side window with the flashlight and
sprays directly into the face of the Mystery Man

The car door opens and the occupant tumbles out coughing and

gagging Michelle now turns on the flashlight and
illuminates Richard moaning on the asphalt of the street

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- NIGHT 48

Michelle has Richard bent over the sink as she runs water to
rinse his eyes of the pepper spray

MICHELLE
What were you thinking

RICHARD
I was worried about you What do
you think Jesus

MICHELLE
Don’t rub them

She turns off the water daubs his eyes with a rag

RICHARD
You tell me you were raped and you
didn’t go to the police Of course
I’m going to My God Jesus you
really did a number on me

MICHELLE
I’m sorry Here let me put some
of this on
That comes out somehow

RICHARD
Is that gonna help Do you know
what you’re doing

MICHELLE
It’s on the pepper spray label It
says to do this in case of contact
with eyes

RICHARD
You know I’ve always had a morbid
fear of going blind

MICHELLE
Youre fine I didn’t recognize the
car Whose car is that anyway

RICHARD
(hesitant)
It’s a friend’s

MICHELLE
(stops nursing wary)
A friends

Even blinded Richard sees there’s no avoiding it-

RICHARD
Her name’s Héléne

MICHELLE
Héléne

RICHARD

I had to borrow her car Mine’s in
the shop Somebody dented the
bumper

MICHELLE
That dent was barely visible

RICHARD
She’s a friend Michelle

MICHELLE

You dont have to spare my feelings

RICHARD

I’m not Why would I Why would I

even have to justify anything

resounding with despair

She puts Vaseline on the rag starts applying it to his eyes

MICHELLE
You don’t

RICHARD
Ok So I’m not

Michelle wrings out the rag

MICHELLE
Is she a student

RICHARD
A grad student

MICHELLE
I guess it was inevitable

RICHARD
She’s not my student She’s a
teaching assistant in a Virginia
Woolf seminar The Critical Studies
department a different department

MICHELLE
But she read your book didn’t she

RICHARD
Yes she has And she did tell me
how deeply it affected her and I
did melt inside OK It all went
down just like you’re picturing it

MICHELLE
It is a little amusing actually-
the way picture it

RICHARD
This jealously is insane

MICHELLE
I’m just concerned Richard this is
what I’ve dreaded I never worried
about the ones with big tits The
ones who read Virginia Woolf will
chew you up and spit you out

RICHARD
Michelle you’re the dangerous one

He gestures to his eyes Michelle smiles despite herself

EXT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- NIGHT 49

Michelle sends a still-partially blinded Richard home in a
TAXI As soon as he’s gone she makes a bee-line for Héléne’s
car opening it via the broken window Searching it like it
was a crime scene filled with potential clues Michelle is
increasingly disheartened to find a young woman’s things
including a graded Final Exam But what really twists the
knife is when Michelle finds the girl’s bejewelled Iphone
under the seat The screen-shot is a “selfie” taken by a
pretty young woman In it Richard is nuzzling with her They
look like a real couple Unself-consciously in love

Michelle methodically puts everything back the way she found
it keeping her emotions in check as best she can

INT MICHELLE’S OFFICE -- DAY 50

Phone to her ear Michelle watches Kevin and another techie
wrestle a 7-foot-tall DEMON through the studio door

MICHELLE (INTO PHONE)
Did you know about her

INTERCUT - INT VINCENT APARTMENTMICHELLE’S OFFICE -- DAY 51

Vincent lays on the couch eating Fritos and watching TV -
with Josie in the bg moving boxes around

VINCENT (INTO PHONE)
I told you I met her

MICHELLE (INTO PHONE)
You didn’t think to mention it

VINCENT (INTO PHONE)
I dont know I
(as Josie lifts heavy box)
Dont lift that Ill move those

JOSIE

MICHELLE
Can you focus for me a second
What’s she like

VINCENT
She’s okay She teaches Yoga

Michelle turns to her computer and googles “Bikram Yoga”

Josie approches Vincent puts her hands on the ottoman

JOSIE

Take your feet off please
VINCENT

Why
JOSIE

I told Eric he could have it

MICHELE
Eric Who is this ‘Eric’

VINCENT
(to Michéle)
At the centre du Marais
(to Josie)
He doesn’t need it right this
second does he

Michelle types ‘centre du Marais’ as she does a new EMAIL
appears on her screen Mildly annoyed she clicks on it
Instantly an attachment opens like a virus an animated gif
showing a photo-shopped likeness of herself being anally
taken by the tentacled Lovecraftian creature from the video
game we glimpsed before

MICHELE
(a Vincent)
I’1l talk to you later

VINCENT (OFF)
(to Josie)

Where are you going now
(to Michéle)

Ok bye

But Michéle has already hung up Michelle becomes even more
disturbed as she sees the “cc” list Dozens of names

She hasn’t even finished scrolling through them when Anna
bursts in closing the door behind her

ANNA
You’ve seen it

MICHELLE
Everybody in the office got this

ANNA
I don’t know

Michelle gets up and peeks out through the blinds at the
front of her office She sees all the employees huddled
around their computers in groups of two three or more Some
cover their mouths in shock Many are laughing When they
look over at Michelle’s office and see her peering out they
react like kids who’ve been busted She closes her blinds

MICHELLE
This isn’t the first thing he’s
sent me

ANNA
Who You think this was sent by
the man who attacked you

MICHELLE
Yes

ANNA
Michelle do you think it’s
possible the person who attacked
you I mean it looks like that

email came from an internal source

MICHELLE
Maybe it did

ANNA
You have to go to the police Now
Yesterday

MICHELLE

No police I’ve had a lifetime’s
worth of police They don’t help
They do anything but help

ANNA
This is different Michelle You’re
the victim

MICHELLE
was the victim then

ANNA

MICHELLE
‘ve worked too hard to put that
all behind me I’ve built this
life I’m not going to bring
police into it
(MORE)

MICHELLE (CONTD)
police reporters Bloggers I will
not allow this cretin to bring that
tidal wave of shit back into my
life

ANNA
But there’s a psychotic out there

MICHELLE
I have experience dealing with
psychotics I’m a pro

She smiles Anna sees Michelle’s point there

INT AV OFFICES - TECH ROOM -- DAY 52

Kevin uncomfortably watches the pornographic animation with
Michelle herself standing over him Meanwhile she
distractedly looks at her Iphone

KEVIN
It’s not necessarily an “inside
job” When our server was hacked in
June somebody ripped the Cthulu
template off our main frame So
these images are floating around
out there

MICHELLE
But that still requires my secret
admirer to be someone highly tech
savvy a former employee maybe

Kevin shrugs Michelle hmms We see what she’s distractedly
looking at on her Iphone the Bikram Yoga web site Head-
shots of the instructors The cheery face of her nemesis
Héléne Zacharian

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
One more question
(shows him phone)
Do you think she’s pretty

INT A YOGA STUDIO -- DAY 53

Michelle’s immediately uncomfortable in the coat she’s
wearing It’s a “hot” yoga session Elderly bodies masses of
wrinkles covered with sweat Against that Héléne a youthful
contortionist looks like an erotic earth goddess

Michelle waits sweltering until the class has broken up abd
the old people are rolling up their mats

Then she puts on the biggest smile she can muster and crosses
the room to Héléne extending her arm for a handshake in an
aggressive way that almost seems like an attack

MICHELLE
Héléne

HELENE
Yes

Smiling uncertainly she takes Michelle’s hand

MICHELLE

I’m Richard’s ex Michelle
HELENE

Oh oh oh nice to meet you
MICHELLE

Hope it’s ok barging in on you like
this I just wanted to apologize to
you Face to face

HELENE
For what
MICHELLE
Your car window I feel terrible
HELENE
No no- please Richard explained
it to me
MICHELLE

Really What was his explanation

HELENE
(a beat confused)
It was an accident

MICHELLE
It was It was an accident
Anyway it was a great excuse to
finally meet you

Michelle gins up her bubbly friendliness again Héléne seems
to pick up on the effort making her a little uncomfortable

HELENE
No no it’s fine This is great
It’s great to finally meet you I
was thinking I was hoping
MICHELLE
At least Richard won’t have to
introduce us now We got the
awkwardness out of the way

HELENE
Was there awkwardness

MICHELLE
Well
HELENE
I mean of course I’m sure there
would be I guess there is was
MICHELLE

But we’ve survived it
Héléne smiles Another awkward beat

HELENE
We should get together some time

MICHELLE
We should In fact I’m having a
Christmas party next week You

HELENE
(smiling)
If I have to

MICHELLE

HELENE
Well very nice to meet you

sweating almost faint)
Would you like some water

MICHELLE
Im fine thanks Very nice to meet

Michelle gets out of there as fast as she can

INT A-V OFFICES -- DAY

As soon as Michelle steps off the elevator she notes the

changed atmosphere in the office Her co-workers seem to look

away quickly whenever she looks at them

INT MICHELLE’S OFFICE -- DAY
Michelle’s secretary sticks her head in
SECRETARY
Vincent called He was calling from

Port Royal

MICHELLE
The hospital

INT HOSPITAL -- DAY

Michelle anxiously moves down the corridor looking in rooms

she passes getting little glimpses of mortality

Vincent meets his mother out in the hall A nervous wreck

he’s still wearing his McDonald’s uniform A very tall dark-

skinned young man wearing a McDonald’s uniform stands by

Inside the room Josie starts screaming at a NURSE

JOSIE (OFF)
Don’t tell me what the doctor told
me bitch I know what the doctor
told me

VINCENT
She had blood in her underwear so
we came to the emergency room They
just did an ultra-sound They say
she had a a placenta

The other kid in the McDonald’s uniform speaks up-

MCDONALD’S KID
Placental abruption

VINCENT
They say everything’s ok but
they’re going to induce labor
This is Omar

MICHELLE
Hello

McDonald’s kid nods back Richard arrives

VINCENT
Dad

RICHARD
No news

Vincent anxiously shakes his head Father and son embrace

INT HOSPITAL - VENDING MACHINES -- MOMENTS LATER 57

Michelle inserts a dollar in a coffee machine The bill is
noisily rejected

RICHARD
Suddenly we’re having a Christmas
party

MICHELLE

I thought we should meet She’s
lovely by the way

Richard doesn’t believe this for a second Michelle finishes
smoothing out her bill inserts it again Again rejection

RICHARD
The whole thing sounds like one of
your little traps

MICHELLE
Ive got bigger things to worry
than plotting diabolical Christmas
dinners By the way is there
anything she won’t eat Any
allergies Marty’s shedding like
crazy

Richard’s skeptical The machine makes its irritating SOUND
as it keeps rejecting the bill He takes out his wallet

RICHARD
I never said a word when you went
with that violinist

MICHELLE
You know the difference He was
married With three kids He had
all the requisite qualities But
her She’s a young single woman
of child-bearing age You broke the
rules

Richard puts his own bill in machine It’s accepted

RICHARD
If we had an agreement like that
you should’ve told me It’s not my
fault

MICHELLE
It is your fault We should still
be together It is your fault

RICHARD
You left me Michelle

MICHELLE
You hit me

The words chill the air between them She takes her coffee

RICHARD
If there’s one thing in my life I
could take back

Vincent finds them excited

VINCENT
It’s here

INT HOSPITAL - MATERNITY WARD -- DAY 58

Michelle Richard and Omar look at the brand new lightly
dark-skinned BABY being held up by the Nurse on the other
side of the glass Reverent silence till-

MICHELLE
There’s going to have to be a DNA
test

The others look askance at Michelle She doesn’t notice or
at least acts like she doesn’t

INT HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY 59

Vincent slips an ice cube between the pale lips of Josie who
offers a wan smile and chews

JOSIE
Are they bringing him in

VINCENT
Right now

She gets suddenly emotional Tears in her eyes

JOSIE
Everything’s going to be good for
him I’m going to be good for him

VINCENT
What are you talking about You’re
perfect

That makes her start to out and out cry The mid-wife rolls
in the baby in an incubator Josie brightens immediately

Vincent spontaneously gives his father a big hug He then
turns to Michelle and starts to hug her too but then holds
back as if remembering not to just giving her a smile
instead

Michelle watches as the baby is handed to Josie who seems a
little disconcerted as it starts crying

VINCENT (CONT’D)
Guess he’s hungry

Josie looks around at everyone in the room seeming
uncharacteristically shy

VINCENT (CONT’D)
Well give you a minute

Josie looks at Michelle Her expression turns resolute
defiant

JOSIE
No It’s alright

Josie bears a breast and we now see what she was abashed
about a crude and truly ugly tattoo a banner over a faded
heart with the name ‘ERIC’ Josie doesn’t avert her eyes from
Michelle silently communicating she knows it’s a legacy of
past stupidity and daring Michelle to say anything about it

EXT HOSPITAL -- NIGHT 60

Michelle smokes a cigarette by the breezeway The Nurse is
out here too Michelle trades smiles with her

MICHELLE
I had him here in this same
hospital- my son

NURSE
That’s amazing

MICHELLE
Not really But what is a little
amazing I guess is that my friend

Anna you met her
NURSE

I did
MICHELLE

She had her baby here the same
night This is where we met Her
child was still-born She asked if
she could breast-feed my baby

NURSE
Oh my

MICHELLE
I said “go ahead” I wonder about
that - they’ve always been
exceptionally close Anna and my
son I wonder if some kind of
imprinting took place Like with
ducks On the other hand myself-
sometimes I look at Vincent this
inconsequential lout I squeezed out
of my own body and realize I don’t
know him at all

Michelle notices the tall turbaned McDonald’s kid exiting
the hospital He throws Michelle a cheerful wave in passing
Michelle directs the Nurse’s attention to him with a nod

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
He’s got a bounce in his step
You’re something of an expert- does
he have the air of a new father

The nurse isn’t sure what Michelle is implying so she just

smiles

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
See I don’t know anything I should
know Like telling Anna “go ahead”
all those years ago - was that what a
normal woman would have done There
are just some things I never learned

INT MICHELLE’S CAR -- NIGHT 61

Almost every house on her street has its colorful Xmas lights
up now Approaching her driveway Michelle stops seeing a
PRIVATE SECURITY CAR in the middle of the street

THE SECURITY GUARD talks to Patrick and Rebecca from behind
the wheel of his car

Michelle leans out her window to see what’s going on Rebecca
comes over to her

REBECCA
Patrick should walk you inside your
house Michelle There’s a prowler
out here Patrick tussled with him

MICHELLE
A “prowler”

Patrick waves goodybe to the security guard joins the women

PATRICK
They’re going to dispatch three
patrol cars to search for this
asshole

MICHELLE
You fought with him

PATRICK
No I did not I caught him in my
bushes He was crouched down
watching your house I approached
him and he just took off

Michelle looks down the street with a weird anticipation

MICHELLE
Did you see his face

PATRICK
No I think he was wearing a mask
Like a ski mask Like a stalker on
a TV show He just took off

REBECCA
Pat you should go in with her

Patrick nods in agreement Michelle shaking her head parks
her car Patrick rejoins her as she gets out

MICHELLE
Im sure it’s not necessary

Patrick waves dismissively No bother They head in

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
I have pepper spray

PATRICK
(smiles)
Good to know

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 62
Michelle comes in cautiously turns on the light Everything

seems in order Michelle takes off her coat and waits while
he has a look around

PATRICK

Everything seems to be ok
MICHELLE

Well thank you I appreciate it
PATRICK

Please I didn’t do shit- pardon my

French

(shakes his head in
frustration looks out at
street wistful)

I almost had him He just took off
so fast In school I could doa
mile in six-fifty

Michelle smiles sympathetically at her would-be knight errant

MICHELLE
The other way to think of it is his
speed was a testament to how scared
he was of you

PATRICK
Thank you for salvaging my pride

MICHELLE
Anytime

For just a moment something passes between them as they
smile at each other A warmth maybe something more Then
Patrick goes right back to helpful neighbor mode
PATRICK
Well if you see anything hear
anything just give a holler
Michelle nods appreciatively He nods back ready to leave

MICHELLE
I’m a grandmother

She has no idea why she said that He’s slightly taken aback

PATRICK
Oh Congratulations

She shrugs as if to say “it was nothing” He smiles a little
awkwardly and withdraws Left alone Michelle mutters at
herself as she closes the door

INT A-V OFFICES -- DAY 63

Michelle’s spreading jam on toast in the office’s little
kitchen Kurt comes in wearing a black ski sweater He nods
politely to her pours himself some coffee She watches him
suspicion creeping up on her He looks up catching the way
she’s looking at him Smiles as if it pleased him

KURT

Yes
MICHELLE

I like your sweater Do you ski
KURT

I do I’1l take you some time if

you like

Michelle is taken aback no idea where he’s coming from She
betrays a bit of discomfort as he leaves her smiling

INT AV OFFICES - OUTER OFFICES - LATER 64
Michelle watches Kurt through the glass window in the studio
door Watching the way he handles a MODEL in demonic make-up
under the studio lights Watching his rough hands on her

INT AV OFFICES - TECH OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 65

Michelle approaches Kevin at his desk

MICHELLE

Kevin you target shoot right
KEVIN

Yes
MICHELLE

The point is you own guns

KEVIN
A couple

MICHELLE
Can you teach me

66 INT FIRING RANGE -- DAY 66
Michelle holds a 38 in her hands like dirty harry taking
aim at a silhouette target

MICHELLE
Now I don’t pull I squeeze right
I saw that in a few different
movies

KEVIN
You just pull the trigger

Michelle pulls the trigger Hits the silhouette in the leg

MICHELLE
na real situation that would do

KEVIN
na real situation he’d probably
be moving faster

MICHELLE
True

KEVIN
Try the 44

Kevin hands her another gun

MICHELLE
Kevin I also wanted to talk to you
because I’ve got an off-the-books
assignment for you

KEVIN
A black op

MICHELLE
I want to find out who created the
animation in that email You know
the one I’m talking about

Kevin looking a little embarrassed nods

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
To do that I need you to hack into
the home computers of everyone in
this office All the men anyway
Well all the males

KEVIN
Michelle I want to help but
that’s a for-real major violation
MICHELLE
Trust me it’s only a metaphorical

violation

(hits target in the head)
But I do appreciate how you might
feel about it That’s why I’m
offering you ten thousand dollars
off the books This would be just
between us Our thing

Kevin likes the sound of that As she knew he would

KEVIN
You know you go through people’s
things people are going to have
some embarrassing stuff

MICHELLE
Understood My gaze is completely
non-judgemental

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- TWILIGHT 67

Michelle stands at her window Looking at Patrick wearing a
“wife beater” stringing Xmas lights around Joseph Mary and
Infant Jesus in his lawn creche She moves to another window
This angle too is obscured by a tree

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - ATTIC -- TWILIGHT 68

Michelle has binoculars to her eyes She’s curled up ina
narrow space watching Patrick at work With her free hand
she touches herself more and more vigorously As with a
barely audible whimper she finishes the Xmas lights start
to blink on below

She breathes a moment then rips open a “Handi-Wipe” and
cleans her fingers

EXT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- TWILIGHT 69

Rebecca places a ceramic sheep to the creche Patrick sees
they’ve run out of lights

PATRICK
Think we got enough illumination
here

REBECCA
(disappointed insistent)
The Infant’s head has to light up

Patrick smiles Of course As he disappears into the
backyard Rebecca looks up and sees Michelle coming toward
her Michelle musters her best friendly-neighbor smile

MICHELLE
Hey Rebecca

Rebecca shows her how a friendly neighbor smile’s done

REBECCA
Hey

MICHELLE
This is beautiful

REBECCA
I love this scene This is where it
all started

MICHELLE
It is I know this is kind of
rudely last minute but I’m having a
little Christmas get-together
tomorrow night

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- NIGHT 70

CLOSE ON Michelle’s fingers insert wooden toothpicks into
bacon-wrapped shrimp to the tune of baroque 70s glam rock

MICHELLE
It would be theoretically possible
to serve Richard’s lady love one of
these with a toothpick embedded deep
inside

Anna helping out in the kitchen smiles

ANNA
You could just poison her

MICHELLE
She’d see it coming I’m sure she’s
already got me pegged as some kind
of Medea figure

ANNA
She’s not a classics major

In the adjacent living room Richard and Robert heatedly
debate Michelle’s vinyl collection Richard shouts to the
women in the kitchen waving an LP like a battle flag

RICHARD
For Your Pleasure red vinyl Hey

There’s a loud GLEEEECH of a needle lifting as Robert
commandeers the turntable over Richard’s protest

MICHELLE
They should just take their cocks
out and measure

ANNA
The way Robert loves to relive his
youth it should worry me - we know
where that leads don’t we

Michelle smiles again but this one’s a bit tense Anna sees
Vincent coming up the walk as Josie the new baby (screaming)
in her arms goes back to close the car door Vincent enters
the kitchen carrying a homemade pie

VINCENT
I’m gonna pop this in the fridge
Josie made it It’s apple She used
a recipe but she added blueberries
to it The recipe didn’t have
blueberries she just added that

Josie carrying the screaming baby snaps at Vincent from the
living room

JOSIE
What are you thinking You left
the car door wide open

VINCENT
Well is it closed now

Josie stalks out of sight shaking her head wearily The
things she puts up with

ANNA
I swear I’m this close to calling
social services on that bitch

Follow Vincent as he tracks Josie down in the living room
Before he can apologize she shoves the baby in his arms

JOSIE
He smells horrible

Josie leaves Vincent to start rummaging through a large
diaper bag for the necessary materials The baby’s screaming
is as loud as the Iggy Pop Robert’s put on

RICHARD
Youre trying to make my grandson
deaf with that shit

IRENE (0S)
Hello all

Michelle’s mother is making her entrance like a grand dame

squired by her paramour Rafe who wears a sports jacket over

a shirt open to show off gold chains The 75-year-old wears a
short black skirt and inches of almost Baby Jane make-up

This is what greets Michelle as she enters the living room
holding a plate Anna at her side

MICHELLE
Promise you’ll kill me If I ever

Anna smiles Irene sees her daughter comes her way

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
At the very first sign kill me

Michelle exchanges kisses with her mother

RAFE
Sorry were late But I wanted to
find something special This is a
decent cabernet

The DOORBELL rings As Rafe expounds on his wine selection
Michelle crosses down the entry hall to open the front door
Bob finally turns down music to watch Michelle greet Patrick
and his wife Rebecca Shes holding a trivia board game

REBECCA
Scrabble

Michelle embraces her warmly Patrick gives Michelle a
brotherly kiss on the cheek

PATRICK
No more excitement the last couple
of days

MICHELLE

No It seems the block’s been
fairly bogeyman free
(re a curious Robert
wandering over)
(MORE )

MICHELLE (CONTD)
Anyway were all safe tonight
Robert here has a black belt

She places a hand on Robert’s arm as she moves on leaving
Robert with Patrick and his wife

PATRICK
I just got my red belt in March I
was doing Tai Kwan Do for years but
I switched to Shokatan

ROBERT
I’ve never done karate She was
making a joke

PATRICK
Oh Very funny

Robert gives a fake smile then he moves off continuing to
follow Michelle He catches up with her

ROBERT
You can’t avoid me all night

MICHELLE
I disagree

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM -- LATER 71

Michelle places a shrimp appetizer in front of empty chair
Anna and she are still putting the last plates on the table
Pleasant conversation as everybody takes their seats

JOSIE
We finally put in the new carpeting
but there’s just no end to it

Rebecca mms sympathetically Patrick comes over to Michelle

PATRICK
Thanks for having us We don’t get
out much I have to admit

The doorbell RINGS Richard is up like a shot Michelle
watches Richard pass out of sight almost apprehensively

PATRICK (CONTD)
It’s kind of unfortunate for
Rebecca She’s a very social
person And I guess I’m not

MICHELLE
Well I’m glad she dragged you over
here tonight

PATRICK
It’s no hardship

Patrick surprises Michelle slightly by giving her wrist a
little squeeze Michelle smiles - but only briefly as she now
sees Richard returning with his arm around Héléne

HELENE
So sorry I couldn’t get here
earlier I couldn’t get off work

MICHELLE
We’re just sitting down

Michelle gives her a kiss Anna watches Michelle’s reaction
as Héléne sits down beside Richard Amid the rumble of good
cheer people dig in Rebecca smiling speaks up-

REBECCA
Ill say grace if everybody likes

People look a little taken aback by her cheery offer Michelle
shoots a furtive sidelong glance over at Patrick and sees his
smile tighten ever-so-slightly with embarrassment

MICHELLE
Please

Rebecca Patrick and Michelle’s mother close their eyes and
folds her hands Rafe seeing Irene doing it follows suit
Everybody else slightly uncomfortably just tries to sit
there respectfully

REBECCA
Jesus Christ bless this food to
our use and us to thy service
Fill our hearts with grateful
praise Amen

IRENE
Amen
ROBERT
(too loud)
Amen

Anna gives Robert a chastising look People start eating Wine
is being passed around Michelle keeps looking over at Richard
and Héléne leaning together whispering conspiratorially

ANNA
So Patrick what do you do
PATRICK
Well I work in banking but I plead
the fifth
ANNA

Oh why’s that

PATRICK
Oh I was just joking but you
know not a very popular profession
at the moment

ROBERT
(eyes on Michelle)
Or ever really

PATRICK
Or ever

Rebecca looks mildly scandalized as Josie casually begins to
breast-feed her baby at the table Michelle raises her glass

MICHELLE
A toast to all of us and especially
the newcomers to our table Héléne
Patrick Rebecca

She looks at Rafe as if blanking on his name (playfully)

RAFE
Rafe

She nods smiling then focuses on Héléne

MICHELLE
God bless us one and all

Everyone toasts They go back to eating Héléne takes a bite
of appetizer She winces Spits something into her palm It
takes her a moment to process what she’s looking at a little
piece of wood She looks over at Michelle Wondering
Michelle does not look her way

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM -- LATER 72

Vincent paces with the baby and Anna and Michelle take dirty
plates away as Richard on a roll holds court

RICHARD
Originality singularity - they use
to be valued now they’re a
liability

Michelle leans over- confidentially - to Héléne

MICHELLE
Richard is first and foremost a
theorist

Héléne’s not sure what that means It sounds like a dig

RICHARD
And Im not talking about novelty-
weve got novelty coming out of our
ass

ANNA
That’s a delightful image for the
dinner table

Michelle settles back down in her chair Slightly buzzed she
looks over at Patrick who sits there swirling his wine glass
looking bored A mischievous smile appears on her face

HELENE
I tell Richard- he’s so negative
He’s too young to be a curmudgeon

Under the table Michelle lets her knee graze Patrick’s He
reacts with surprise then looks away Pretending nothing
happened Vincent hands the baby back to Josie goes into the
kitchen Michelle escalates the game of “footsie” slipping
off her shoe running a foot up the length of his leg
Patrick smiles uncertainly Robert observes this looks at
Michelle sees her smiling to herself Michelle’s foot is
just at Patrick’s groin as Irene stands

IRENE
I guess this is as good a time as
any I have an announcement Cue
the drum-roll Rafe and I are
engaged to be married

Rebecca cheers Everyone else reacts with more polite
clapping Except Michelle who bursts out laughing

MICHELLE
I’m sorry excuse me but how do
you manage to be so ludicrous

Her mother’s face wrinkles up but she doesn’t answer A pall
falls over the table - broken only by Vincent returning from
the kitchen with pie

VINCENT
Hope everybody’s ok with blueberries
Josie put a ton in this They’re not
even in the official recipe

Everybody murmurs compliments making a big deal over the pie
to cover up the awkwardness Josie basks in it

JOSIE
It was an experiment

EXT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - LATER 73

Michelle smokes a cigarette out on the patio In the bg
the guests migrate from the dining table to the living room
Rebecca approaches from inside to speak to Michelle-

REBECCA
It’s almost midnight Do you mind
if I put on the mass

MICHELLE
By all means

Michelle sees Richard and Héléne coats in hand getting
ready to go She quickly puts out her cigarette

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 74
»-and comes back inside to see Richard and Héléne off

MICHELLE
Taking off already

HELENE
ts my fault I have family
obligations

RICHARD

This was wonderful though
Michelle Really Next time’s our
turn You’1ll come to us

MICHELLE
That’1ll be wonderful but there’s no
reason to rush it

HELENE
Let us handle it Richard We’ll
have lunch together first Michelle
and I Just the two of us Take
things one step at a time

MICHELLE
(sincerely impressed)
I agree
RICHARD

Well great
Michelle takes Héléne’s hand To Richard-

MICHELLE
Drive safe

It sounds like “I love you” Filled with pining and regret
Richard kisses her and he and Héléne head out the door So as
not to watch them go Michelle heads to the kitchen

Robert sulking has switched to Scotch He follows her

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS 75
Robert corners Michelle out of sight of the doorway

ROBERT
Your idiotic flirting with the
banker - was that for my benefit

MICHELLE
Are you going to make a scene in my
home Robert Is this the kind of
thing I can expect now

ROBERT
(seething)
We can talk later
He turns to return to the party She stops him

MICHELLE
Hold on Your prop

She hands him a cup of coffee to take with him

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT 76

Michelle returns with more coffee Rebecca and her mother are
watching a broadcast of the Midnight Mass live from the
Vatican Chanting voices fill the room (continuously in the
background during the rest of the scene) The others are
playing the Trivia Madness Patrick sips cognac alone
Michelle sits down next to him Looks at the mass on the TV

MICHELLE
Close the book ring the bell blow
out the candle

PATRICK
What’s that

MICHELLE
What kind of Catholic are you You
never heard the rite of
excommunication

PATRICK
Have you

MICHELLE
From time to time

She smiles like a mischievous child plotting something

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
My father always made the sign of
the cross on my forehead before I
went out the door to go to school
Actually he did it to all the kids
on our block Some parents finally
asked him to stop

PATRICK
I guess I can see why

MICHELLE
My father apparently took it as a
grave sleight That night he made
the rounds Door to door every
house on our block with a shotgun
a tenderizing mallet and a pair
kitchen knives

PATRICK
(uncomfortable)
I heard about that

MICHELLE
Youve heard about the twenty-seven
people You may not know about the
pets They get short shrift Six
dogs a couple of cats He spared a
hamster for some obscure reason
You can’t make this shit up

Michelle chuckles Patrick doesn’t know how to react

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
I was doing my homework when he
walked back in with blood all over
him My mom was at work - she was a
nurse in those days Can you

imagine

PATRICK
We don’t have to talk about this
Michelle

MICHELLE

I don’t mind It’s cathartic
(smiles wryly at that)
When my father decided he wanted to
burn everything in the house I
helped him put things in the fire
We were pulling down drapes
tearing up carpeting Throwing it
all in It was exciting You get
caught up in a project like that
We were just starting to burn our
clothes when the police finally
moved in Somebody snapped a photo
of me I was half-naked slimed
with ash from the fire That photo
more than anything really cemented
in people’s minds that I was my
psycho father’s psycho little
helper

Patrick seems equally appalled and fascinated by Michelles
tale She amused by his reaction

PATRICK
Wow

MICHELLE
Yeah huh

Michelle smiling gets up and walks away leaving him to
stew in it to the sounds of the televised mass and runs
into Irene coming the other way a little wobbly

IRENE
Are you aware how brutal you were
to me at dinner

MICHELLE
Yes I am And that was just the
beginning

IRENE
You become so cruel when confronted
with something you find unpleasant
I’ve apparently become one of those
unpleasant things

MICHELLE
Neither one of us is drunk enough
yet for this conversation

Irene gives Michelle a dismissive snort and walks on Two
seconds later Michelle hears a CRASH and turns A coffee
table’s upended bottles on the floor Everyone getting up
concerned

And her mother on the floor

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
Jesus

She’s about to start yelling outrage at her mother’s latest
stunt but she sees the faces around her sees it’s for real

INT AMBULANCE -- NIGHT 77

Michelle rides in the back with her mother and a PARAMEDIC
She can’t look at her mother like this so she looks
everywhere else But then she hears her mother trying to say
something from under her oxygen mask

MICHELLE
You shouldnt try to talk Just
concentrate on breathing

Her mother insists on speaking Michelle leans in close Her
mother’s voice is hoarse very faint but clear-

IRENE
Go see him

Michelle looks chilled by the words As if this were some
kind of curse cast upon her

INT HOSPITAL -- DAY 78

Michelle stands anxiously in the waiting area with Vincent
Robert and Anna The DOCTOR comes out to talk to her

DOCTOR
She’s had a major stroke We
alleviated the pressure on her
brain but remains unresponsive

ANNA
Unresponsive meaning

DOCTOR
She is comatose

MICHELLE
How long

DOCTOR
There’s no telling She’s stable
right now Her blood serum is

MICHELLE
This is real

DOCTOR
(as if he didnt hear)
Excuse me

MICHELLE
There’s no way she’s faking or
playing it up or anything You’re
medically certain this is for real

The doctor looks at her a moment surprised by the question

DOCTOR
I’m sorry no I have to tell you
there’s a high likelihood your
mother will not wake up again

Michelle reels

DOCTOR (CONTD)
But as I say she’s stable I
suggest you get some rest There’s
nothing you can do here right now

Michelle nods distantly Anna puts her arm around her The
Doctor takes his leave Robert stands there looking useless

ANNA
You should come home with us At
least for a shower

Michelle looks at her not quite able to respond

INT ANNA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM -- NIGHT 79

Robert and Anna help Michelle in Michelle is moving like a
zombie Anna looks back over her shoulder at Robert

ANNA
Would you mind sleeping in the
guest room

He decides at the last second not to protest He leaves them
alone Anna helps Michelle off with her coat

MICHELLE
Did you see Richard with Héléne

ANNA
I did Lie down

MICHELLE
(nods sits on the bed)
He was running through his little
routines And she seemed amused by

them all

ANNA
You know you’1ll wind up being good
friends

MICHELLE

Oh no doubt I’11 start going over
there for supper just the three of
us I see myself ringing a doorbell
holding a box of macaroons and I
shudder

Anna smiles She gets Michelle to lie back Michelle winds up
pulling her onto the bed with her

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
I can’t begrudge him happiness now
Richard was there for me through a
the darkest days And they got dark
We couldn’t go out in public But
Richard was like a knight for
meMy mother never had that She
always had to face it alone

ANNA
It’s good you realize that
MICHELLE
It doesn’t excuse anything Any of
her ridiculous But she did have

it hard Once in a market an old
man threw a raw steak at her A
good piece of meat He paid for it
just to fling it at her In the
middle of a recession

ANNA
That old bastard’s probably dead

now if he ate a lot of meat I say

congestive heart failure in 2003

Michelle smiles as Anna holds her Brushes hair her out of
her face They fall into incredibly intimate silence Anna

nuzzles her nose like an eskimo

ANNA (CONTD)
Do you remember the time in Cassis
We tried

MICHELLE
(remembers smiling)
We couldn’t get through it without
laughing

Anna smiles They leave it at that

INT ANNA’S BEDROOM -- MORNING

Michelle wakes up feeling something strange It takes her a
moment to recognize that Robert’s hand is up her nightshirt

She kicks away from him

MICHELLE
What are you doing

ROBERT
Anna’s gone to the office

He says that as if it explained everything Michelle gets up

ROBERT (CONTD)
I was just trying to make you feel
better

MICHELLE
(earnestly sizing him up)
I wonder if your stupidity was what
attracted me to you in the first
place

ROBERT
Im sorry if I misjudged

MICHELLE
Look I can’t do this anymore We
have to stop

ROBERT
Right

MICHELLE
You were a great partner and we’ll
still be friends

ROBERT
You’re serious

MICHELLE
This whole ridiculous situation was
getting too much to bear you don’t

feel that all The humiliating
absurdity of it all

ROBERT
Uh no

She strips off the nightshirt He takes this as a provocation
and tries to again put his hand down her panties She removes
his hand starts collecting her clothes He stands there
dumbstruck seeing she really means it

ROBERT (CONTD)
Your breasts have gotten bigger

MICHELLE
No I don’t think so Not that I’m
aware of

ROBERT

No doubt about it

She slips on a sweater Looks for her shoes He finds her
left one withholds it from her

ROBERT (CONTD)
Tell me you don’t want me anymore
and that’1ll be the end of it

MICHELLE
It’s not as simple as that but all
right I’m telling you I don’t want
this anymore this situation the
lies

ROBERT
You dodged my question

MICHELLE
Sorry I no longer want to fuck
you Was that the question

She takes her shoe He looks like a child denied a treat

ROBERT
This is pretty sudden Michelle I
think we should take it in stages

MICHELLE
No It’s like quitting smoking Cold
turkey’s the only way to do it

ROBERT
You never quit smoking

MICHELLE
Well there’s your solace- maybe
Ill weaken down the line

ROBERT
No you won’t This is a Michelle
decision As absolute as it is
arbitrary

Michelle starts out He steps in front of her

ROBERT (CONTD)
You cant do this You can’t just
unilaterally do this

MICHELLE
Move Robert

Michelle moves past him but she looks back over her
shoulder Unsure what he might do

INT HOSPITAL -- DAY

Michelle sits at her mother’s bedside eating a salad out

a clear plastic container with a plastic fork Her mother
tubes coming out of her everywhere

of
has

MICHELLE

I wont see him you know I don’t
believe in the superstition of death-
bed requests If you imagine you can
manipulate me with this hideous
stunt Ever since you decided the
laws of God and Man no longer applied
to you and started acting out like a
spoiled teenager you never gave a
shit what I thought What your
behavior did to me This aneurysm
thing stands out only for its
disgusting treachery This salad
is awful They just dumped in a can
of olives

(stares out window)
You can’t stay mad at me you know

Michelle notices that the TV suspended from the wall is on
the fritz She drags her chair over to stand on it while she
tries to adjust it

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
Of course BFM-TV is the one
station that comes in

She keeps switching back and forth through channels She
registers only vaguely at first the whole TEAM of doctors
and nurses rushing into the room and gathering around her
mother’s bed When she sees them she fills with fear

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
What’s going on

They don’t answer Too busy swarming around Irene taking
urgent measurements Michelle is terrified now

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
I thought I heard a different beep
Was that the sound

Her voice comes out weak a little girl’s squeak They don’t
hear her Finally one of the nurses sees her

NURSE
Miss you have to go outside

The Nurse gently but firmly pushes her toward the door
Helpless lost Michelle finds herself standing out in the
hall looking in

EXT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- TWILIGHT 82

Michelle gets out of car sluggish like a sleepwalker She
stops as she sees the LIGHT is on in her upstairs bedroom

The curtains there billow spookily

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 83

Michelle comes in warily Marty the cat leaps into her arms
She takes him with her as she heads upstairs

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS 84

Michelle enters cautiously She discovers the covers have
been ripped off her bed and a NOTE - written in red lipstick -
left atop the crumpled sheets

She reads sorry I couldn’t wait

She then notices the cum sprayed all over the violet colored
sheet Michelle sets Marty down and starts stripping the
bedding like it was just another chore

EXT COUNTRYSIDE -- DAY 85

Dressed as if for a cocktail party Michelle leads a somewhat
clumsy parade up a steep grassy hill Richard Anna Robert
Vincent Josie and Rafe are all respectfully attired too
though Rafe looks like he was hanging out poolside Vincent
carries a cardboard box that looks like it might contain
Chinese takeout The babys screaming in Josies arms

MICHELLE
Im looking for a spot that might
have some significance But its
not like theres going to be a sign
that says dispose of mother
here

RICHARD
We had a picnic over there once-
that hollow over there

MICHELLE
I remember Her chicken salad gave
me horrific gas I dont want to
immortalize that

Behind them an eruption The new mother is suddenly crying
loudly carrying on- and obviously not for Michelle’s mother

JOSIE
Just leave me alone You can’t
fucking fix everything

VINCENT
Josie

JOSIE
Leave me alone

She storms off with the baby down the hill Everyone looks
mortified Vincent plays it off like a big joke

VINCENT
She wanted to say something About
grandma But then she realized she
didn’t really have anything to say
and she got upset over that and
then Its post-partum you
know I just hope my boy doesnt
take after her in the temperament
department

MICHELLE

Vincent hes a lovely child but
hes not your boy Dont lose sight
of that

Vincent doesn’t really hear her He holds up a pacifier

VINCENT
Here it is After all that

MICHELLE
Did you hear me Vincent

VINCENT
Yeah sure but what

MICHELLE
The boy is not really yours
Vincent That’s what I’m telling
you Look at him His skin is two
tones darker than you or Josie’s
You must see that

VINCENT
(getting angry now)
Whose is he if he’s not mine

MICHELLE
Hes his father’s I guess And
you’re not his father Vincent I’m
sorry but you’re being made a fool
of

Vincent raises his hand as if he were going to hit Michelle
She waits for it Almost daring him to hit her He wavers as
Anna comes into the room to see what’s up

ANNA
Vincent

He looks at his mother stammering unable to find words

VINCENT
I just You’re a cunt

Fighting tears Vincent hands Michelle the box and stalks
off Anna shoots Michelle a more confused than accusing look
and goes off after him down the hill Michelle looks around

MICHELLE
This is as good as anywhere I
guess The winds blowing out

Richard shrugs Michelle opens the box and dumps the ashes
Which land largely in a clump at her feet Looks like thats
it She reluctantly accepts a clasp of hands from Rafe

Rafe approaches She reluctantly accepts a clasp of hands

RAFE
Michelle I just wanted to say
again Im so sorry Michelle If
you need anything

MICHELLE
Im fine Are you planning on going
back to my mother’s apartment

RAFE
(taken aback by question)
Where else would I go

She looks at him Decides to let that opening pass
MICHELLE
Just don’t burn the place down
Apart from that we’ll see

Rafe acts like that was all he could hope for Michelle
endures a kiss on the cheek

Robert nods stiffly and heads down with Rafe Richard lingers
as Michelle stands there on the hill watching the wind
slowly erode the mound of ashes

EXT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- NIGHT 86

A wind gathers strength Tree branches sway Xmas lights slip
loose of their moorings Michelles house is dark only one
light on the second floor A loose shutter up there creaks
loudly back and forth

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- NIGHT 87

The CREAKING can be heard in Michelle’s bedroom as she
wearing a night-shirt examining storyboards A zombie
soldier extends a tentacle-like arm toward the viewer The
caption “It’s just you and me now”

Michelle jumps as the steady creaking becomes a BANG - the
wind slamming the shutter against the side of the house

At the same time The doorbell RINGS downstairs Michelle
finds this curious

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - ENTRYWAY -- NIGHT 88

Michelle opens the door in her knee-length night shirt and
finds Patrick on her stoop

PATRICK
I didn’t want to disturb you but I
just got home and saw all your
shutters are open The weather’s
turning fast Half your windows are
gonna get blown out

MICHELLE
That wouldn’t be good

PATRICK
I know it probably sounds like I’m
being chicken little or something
but itll amaze you what the winds
can do up here

MICHELLE
No I’ve seen it You should’ve
been here in ‘99 It was like the
end of the world

PATRICK
I believe it You’re probably going
to need a hand

MICHELLE
Yes probably Thank you

Michelle lets him in Shuts the door behind him

PATRICK
Your mother’s funeral was today

MICHELLE
There was no service We just

She trails off He nods

PATRICK
Im very sorry Michelle

She nods thanks He’s already at the first window brimming
with authority pulling it open and grabbing the shudder
pinned against the outside wall He now engages in a battle
with the elements to pull the window closed Dead leaves
start to blow in Michelle gives a hand An icy wind whipping
them Patrick handles the window while she reaches out and
pull in the shutter Finally it slams shut

Michelle smiles shivers a residual shiver from the cold He
reaches out and rubs her arms through the thin flannel of her
pajamas The innocent gesture takes her aback slightly

MICHELLE
I never counted but I think there’s
something like twenty windows in
this house

PATRICK
The wind’s from the west We’1ll do
that side
INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLBEDROOM 89

Michelle follows Patrick down the hall He stops in the
doorway of her bedroom He gives her a questioning look She
nods- go ahead The bed is a unmade Her underwear is slung
over a chair

MICHELLE
I wasn’t expecting anyone

He smiles He pauses seeing one of Michelle’s storyboards on
the bed It’s a stylized vintage airplane in flames

PATRICK
That looks like a ‘43 Grumman
Wildcat

MICHELLE

I wouldn’t know

PATRICK

I’ve always thought about
rebuilding a vintage aircraft like
that Taking it to Paris

MICHELLE
You fly

PATRICK
No But you got to have a dream
right

They share a little laugh They’re very close only inches
between them the window starts MOANING and CRACKLING in the
wind breaking the spell of the moment

They go into their routine again These shutters are more
difficult When the shutter finally comes free of the wall
it closes so forcefully they both stumble backward onto the
bed beside each other They lie there like that a moment An
electric current passes between them but Patrick
remaining in helpful neighbor mode gets up and goes to
secure the shutter

PATRICK (CONTD)
Almost done

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - ATTIC -- NIGHT 90

Michelle leads Patrick up the narrow staircase in forced
proximity She flips the light switch The bulb BLOWS OUT

MICHELLE
Shit

They go in anyway They have to maneuver in near total
darkness through the low-ceilinged space The wood beams
creak like the end of the world Patrick pull the window open
- the one she watched him through - and starts wrestling with
a shutter It gets away from him Michelle ducks under
Patrick’s outstretched arms to lend a hand Now his arms are
around her Leaning way out the window in freezing wind she
rubs her butt against him Patrick stays focused on his
mission She practically rolls her eyes in frustration What
is it going to take

When they get the shutter closed finally they stay there a
moment still His arms stay around her She waits His hand

lowers her panties slowly exposing her bottom She feels
what his moving hand is doing She moans in pleasure
spreading her legs and bracing herself against a beam

She twists her head around for a kiss but Patrick leaps
backward pulling away from her

PATRICK
I’m sorry

Patrick hurries away leaving her there She hears his
FOOTSTEPS pounding down the stairs She stands there a
moment feeling shame and more than that frustration

MICHELLE
Idiot

She hits a wooden beam with the flat of her hand

INT AV OFFICES -- DAY

Michelle moves through the office like a locomotive of
restless energy She sees Kurt makes a detour to him

MICHELLE

The “Summoning” cut-scene needs to
come later

(cutting him off)
We don’t have time to argue The
player needs to encounter Kira in her
repressed schoolteacher persona
before her Dark Rebirth otherwise
there’s nothing titillating about her
transformation

Kurt clearly wants to debate but Michelle moves on She’s

waved over by Kevin in the doorway of the “Tech” room which

is watched over by an imposing rubber ROBOT SENTRY

KEVIN
Got a minute

INT AV OFFICES - TECH ROOM -- DAY
Michelle sits beside Kevin at his computer

KEVIN
I found this on Kurt’s private
server It looks like he’s into
crushing

MICHELLE
What’s “crushing”

KEVIN
What it sounds like As you see

MICHELLE
(reading off screen)
“Sammantha gardens”

A video plays an overly made-up woman wielding a watering

can in an evening gown keeps “accidentally” stepping on bugs
wrangled at her feet

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
It’s disturbing Not exactly a
smoking gun though

KEVIN
I guess not

Michelle looks at Kevin She’s struck by something Something
in the way he looks at her

MICHELLE
Good work Keep on it
93 INT ANNAS OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 93
Anna looks up Michelle enters moving swiftly

MICHELLE
Id like a consultation

Michelle goes straight to Anna’s Mac calls up that
pornographic animation Anna looks confused by this

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
The creature sodomizing me
doesn’t he look like Kevin a
little
She brings up an employee portrait of Kevin for comparison

ANNA
A little around the eyes Yes

Michelle nods feeling a surge of vindication

INT MICHELLE’S OFFICE -- NIGHT 94

Most of the lights in the suite are off Michelle sits at her
desk antsy fiddling with an e-cigarette as she watches a
MAINTENANCE GUY empty a trash can When he moves off the
last lights go out

INT AV OFFICES - TECH ROOM -- CONTINUOUS 95

Michelle leaves the lights off as she crosses directly to
Kevin’s work station She moves collectible action figurines
out of the way so she can access his keyboard She pushes a
master power button and immediately a LOUD HUM comes out of
his speakers

She quickly turns the volume down Looks around to make sure
no one’s been drawn by the sound She hears nothing

The laptop takes forever to boot up When it finally does
Michelle enters a password Another screen comes up She
clicks on a list of files Scanning them one name
immediately jumps out at her Ashgirlmvk

Michelle hesitates almost fearfully before she clicks on it

The news photo of her as a child is the first that comes up
but there others some we saw in that TV broadcast There are
several photos of her father too One where he’s posed with a
gun Another click and she sees the original sketch version
of that animation of her being raped by the creature

The LIGHTS COME ON Michelle starts like a cat burglar caught
in the act It’s Kevin in the door

KEVIN
Oh I didn’t know it was you

She holds her breath as he comes toward her He sees what
she’s looking at

KEVIN (CONTD)
You’re probably mad

MICHELLE
At this moment I’m mostly curious

KEVIN
I guess I have to tell you

MICHELLE
Yes you do
KEVIN
I was never going to show it to
anyone Phillip Kwan ripped the
animation off my computer
converted it to an MVK and sent it
to everyone in the office

MICHELLE
But you created it
KEVIN
Yes
MICHELLE
Why
KEVIN
(devastated)
Personal amusement It started

out as an idea for a game that
incorporated true crime footage
then it got weird But nobody would
have seen it if it wasn’t for
fucking Phillip Kwan- who deserves
to be fired if I’m getting fired

Michelle looks at Kevin Sizing him up

MICHELLE
Take out your penis

He thinks she’s joking
MICHELLE (CONT’D)
Show me your penis and I might nor
fire you

He’s abashed but he sees no choice He unzips Displays

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
I thought you were Jewish

KEVIN
Well no

MICHELLE
Put it away The man I’m looking
for doesn’t have a foreskin

Kevin is confused but happily puts his penis away

KEVIN
Am I fired

MICHELLE
I want every bit of this destroyed
and you’re going to sign a non-
disclosure agreement that I’11l
draft for you Then we’ll see

EXT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- TWILIGHT 96

Michelle gets out of her car She’s surprised to see a
PACKAGE on her porch She approaches it as if it were
something ominous but shows relief as she looks at the label

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- NIGHT 97

Michelle uses scissors to open the package She pulls out an
INFANT CAR SEAT Rests it on the table Looks at it with a
certain melancholy thinking of Vincent and his baby

She suddenly becomes aware she’s not alone

She’s just turning around when a GLOVED HAND closes over her
mouth The Intruder wearing the same ski mask throws her to
the ground On her way down she tips the table sending all
kinds of things clattering The scissors fall open on the
floor The lamp winds up on its side casting a weird
noirish light over the struggle now taking place

Michelle tries to twist around to see her attacker He hits
her right in the jaw climbs on top of her He tears her
blouse her bra She screams to raise the dead He’s working
on getting his pants down as Michelle’s desperately reaching
hand brings a bookcase down on both of them

The Intruder gets the worst of it Michelle scrambles free
but she doesn’t get far He grabs her ankle reels her in He
lifts her skirt Tears her panties Michelle kicks at him
blindly He starts slapping her hard about the face as if
punishing her for making this hard for him

Michelle’s hand closes around the open scissors She brings
them up just as the Intruder’s hand is coming down The hand
abruptly stops in mid-air - pierced clean through by one of
the scissors’ blades Now it’s his turn to scream

Michelle seizes the moment to grip her attacker’s mask by the
eyeholes and yank it off his face

Patrick’s eyes are filled with tears of pain Michelle raises
up on her haunches levelling the bloodied scissors at him

MICHELLE
Get out of my house

Patrick backs away in panic holding his injured hand

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
Out Get out

Patrick looks for just a second as if he wanted to say
something Instead he just bolts for the door Quaking
Michelle takes a moment to compose herself

She moves to the window just in time to witness Patrick
running back across the icy street toward his house slipping
and taking a nasty fall Michelle feels an absurd momentary
reflex to go see if he’s okay

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - LATER 98

Michelle walks through the room cleaning up the debris of
the struggle Her legs suddenly seem to go wobbly and she
sinks to the floor She sits there

EXT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- MORNING 99

Michelle comes out to retrieve her newspaper from the
driveway She stops seeing Patrick like any suburban
neighbor comes out of his house with a thermos of coffee
She notes his bandaged hand He sees her They briefly
exchange looks but there is otherwise no acknowledgement of
what’s passed between them as he gets in his car and drives
away

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- EVENING 100
Michelle puts on make-up to cover her bruises Checks herself
out in the mirror Deems the results adequate
INT ANNA AND ROBERT’S HOUSE -- NIGHT 101
New Year’s Eve decor noisemakers
RICHARD

“May the New Year bring you the

courage to break all your

resolutions early”
Michelle is there with him Héléne Anna and Robert She
smiles along with the laughter around her Anna hands her a

drink

MICHELLE
Have you talked to Vincent

ANNA
Last week He was in tears about
how they didn’t have money for
groceries

MICHELLE
(realizing)
You’re loaning them money

ANNA
A little Nothing

MICHELLE
You shouldn’t do that Anna

ANNA
I know I just wish I had it in me
to slap him across the face and
talk some sense into him But
that’s not my role I’m the
eccentric auntie

MICHELLE
Myself I have no problem being
candid I never hid from him what
having him cost me But I think you
know along the way I might have
neglected to mention the love The
ridiculous love I felt for him
Still feel I guess Time puts a
gauze over everything Thank God
Otherwise life would be impossible

The ball in Times Square is getting ready to drop Robert
puts one arm around Micelle the other around Anna He’s been
drinking heavily He leans over to Michelle whispers-

ROBERT
I didn’t invite your new friend
Patrick Hope you’ll forgive me

MICHELLE
For that yes

The countdown begins “Ten nine “ Michelle puts on a
smile as cheers go up at midnight And now the obligatory
kisses are oddly charged Michelle has to witness Richard and
Héléne’s kiss then give Héléne a kiss herself Michelle and
Richards kiss is tentative filled with sad longing on her
side anyway When Robert kisses Michelle he tries to slip in
a little something extra And when Michelle kisses Anna
there’s a touch of Judas in it

Auld lang syne is still going as Michelle takes out a
cigarette and wanders off toward the patio She doesn’t get
far before Robert catches up with her

ROBERT
If you go out now you’re going to
miss my big announcement

MICHELLE
What are you doing

ROBERT
Ive been thinking about it and
youre right- it might be better
for everyone if we were just adult
and honest about everything Let’s
start the new year with a clean

slate
MICHELLE

Fine do it You’re pathetic
ROBERT

Take that back
Michelle shakes her head almost laughing
ROBERT (CONT’D)

“Youre pathetic” Take it back
right now or I’m going to do it

MICHELLE
I take it back You’re not pathetic
at all

He reddens She stares him down

ROBERT
You can’t just cut me off like I
was some jerk-off and think there
won’t be consequences

MICHELLE
Are you for real Blackmail

ROBERT
You’re the one changing the terms
Michelle I just want things to
stay like they are

MICHELLE
You are a fucking asshole And I
really mean that

ROBERT
Im ok with being an asshole
That’s acceptable Wednesday
Just see me Wednesday I just want
to see you one more time

Michelle looks around chilled by his pathetic extortion She
looks over at Anna

ROBERT (CONTD)
I’1ll get a room at the Park Hyatt
You used to like that I’1l bring
the Vueve Clicquot

MICHELLE
Alright Wednesday

ROBERT
Don’t look like that I want to
remind you fucking me was not

father appears behind the TV Anchor’s shoulder

TV ANCHOR
Parole was again denied for mass
murderer George Leblanc

Michelle mutes the sound The image cuts to a close-up of her
father sitting sullenly alone at his parole hearing

an empty orange plastic chair to sit in a very solicitous
Asst Warden comes out to meet her

anything A cup of coffee

MICHELLE
No Thank you

ASST WARDEN
We can talk in my office if you
don’t mind It’s just here

He gestures the way Michelle nods follows

MICHELLE
You should know I’m here just to
spit in my father’s face And I
can’t promise I’m only speaking
metaphorically

ASST WARDEN
People have all kinds of reasons

MICHELLE
Im here because I’ve given that
bastard too much power over me
Shunning him fearing him All that
wasted energy

ASST WARDEN
Miss Leblanc your father is dead

Michelle stops walking She can’t believe it

ASST WARDEN (CONT’D)
Shortly before eight AM this
morning your father was found
deceased in his cell

MICHELLE
How

ASST WARDEN
The incident is in the earliest
stages of being investigated but it
seems he was able to fashion a
noose from his bedding and hanged
himself

MICHELLE
When When did this happen

ASST WARDEN
We only know it must have been
between 10 PM and the early morning
hours

MICHELLE
Do you happen to know what time my
father was notified that I was
coming to see him

ASST WARDEN
(hesitant)
That would have been just before ten

Michelle nods again slowly

INT PRISON - MORGUE -- DAY 106

Michelle is led through a chilly storage room by the Asst
Warden and an ATTENDENT in blue surgical cover-alls

ASST WARDEN
Your mother made arrangements for
your father to be cremated and
installed in a vault next to one
she’d selected for herself

MICHELLE
She’s not there She’s on my
kitchen counter

The Asst Warden has no response They arrive at a gurney
with a human-shaped lump under a sheet

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
I had a list of things I was going
to say Nine bullet points

The Attendant looks to her She nods she’s ready He pulls
back the sheet Her father looks like a peaceful old man
except for the lurid laceration around his throat She
studies him

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
Hed rather die than face me I
killed him by coming here

INT PRISON - MORGUE -- MOMENTS LATER 107

Anger grief relief perhaps

Michelle presses a button on the steering wheel to hang up
She reaches over with a trembling hand and turns off the
radio She’s distantly alarmed to see blood She investigates
and sees her leg is banged up pretty nicely by the buckled
dashboard She shakily presses a number on her phone

Voice-mail Michelle hangs up She scrolls down to the next
name on her phone’s contacts list Richard It rings Rings
some more She hangs up Looking around something catches

Michelle limps in Not wanting to spend a second longer here
than she has to Michelle goes straight to a particular
cabinet She puts the box on the floor and starts putting
things in it mostly old pictures

Rafe comes out of the back hair mussed wearing boxer shorts
and an inside-out white T-shirt Shaking his head upset

RAFE
Oh no Michelle You can’t do this

MICHELLE
What can’t I do

RAFE

You realize I own this place right

RAFE
That may be but your mother invited
me to stay here and while I’m here

A completely naked BRUNETTE in her thirties emerges from
behind Rafe Rafe looks like a busted teenager Michelle
smiles He gestures to the woman to go back where she was

MICHELLE
Anyway I’m selling it That’s what
I’m doing here

Michelle reaches into her purse and produces a “FOR SALE”
sticker Rafe seethes impotently as Michelle hobbles over to
the window looking out onto the street

RAFE
I saw on the news your father died
One less evil fucker in the world

Michelle carefully affixes the sticker to the window

MICHELLE
You should start packing your bags

Rafe snorts Michelle collects her box from the floor- a
difficult procedure juggling the cane at the same time

RAFE
I’ve seen all the shows on TV
About you and your dad when you
killed all those people

When she drops one of the photos Rafe laughs so she can hear
it Michelle ignores him retrieves the photo with as much
dignity as she can

I’ve seen all the old news photos
All the bodies

OR PERHAPS

Michelle shakes her head taking it all in as Vincent
clumsily shoves a bottle in the baby’s mouth

be angry You have responsibilities-
including a new apartment - and you
quit your job

Vincent you have to take him back
right now You’re not married This
could be considered kidnapping

VINCENT
Kidnapping He’s my son
(off her look)
HE’S MY SON

MICHELLE
Alright

VINCENT
Not “alright”

There’s a FURIOUS KNOCKING downstairs

MICHELLE
(sarcastically)
Who could that be

She turns and heads down the stairs She opens the front door
and Josie bursts in moving right past Michelle

JOSIE
Where is he

Vincent appears on the stairs Michelle watches anxiously as
Josie goes up the stairs toward him tearing into him

JOSIE (CONTD)
Where’s my baby
(not giving him a chance
to answer)
Where’s my baby Is he alright
What did you do to him

VINCENT
(confused)
What did I do to her

JOSIE
I wouldn’t trust you to take care
of a hamster Fucking idiot
Where’s my baby Give him to me
right fucking now Now

The baby’s cry alerts her to his location She passes Vincent
on the stairs He grabs her wrist Josie wheels on him

JOSIE (CONTD)
Get your hand off me Get your hand
off me Get your hand off me

MICHELLE
Vincent Let her go

He doesnt immediately A moment of unbearable suspense
Vincent looks ready to hit her before he finally does let
her go She charges upstairs He starts to go after her

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
Let her go

Vincent looks at his mother like a helpless child The baby’s
CRYING stops A moment later Josie reappears coming down
the stairs bouncing the baby in her arms

VINCENT
Josie

MICHELLE
Vincent be quiet

Josie walks right past him to the front door She stops

JOSIE
I had to take the RER here

Vincent starts plumbing his pockets He’s not finding any
change Michelle crosses to her purse takes out a twenty
She brings it to Josie who glares at Vincent one last time
and exits Vincent’s eyes fill with tears He tries to hide
it Michelle goes to him Looking at him something occurs to
her

MICHELLE
It was always about the baby
wasn’t it He’s what you were in it
for
Vincent looks up like his guilty secret had been found out

VINCENT
I could be a good father I know it

Michelle touches his arm tentative but tender

MICHELLE
Ill make mostaccioli for dinner

INT NATURALIA -- EVENING 127
Michelle browses Vincent approaches with a bag of chips

MICHELLE
Those are so full of salt

Vincent looks disappointed goes to put them back Michelle
pushes the cart around a corner Just as she’s selecting a
tomato sauce she hears Vincent talking to someone in the
aisle just vacated She backs up to look It’s Patrick
Vincent’s talking with him like they were old friends
Seeing Michelle Patrick’s smile tenses up a little

PATRICK
Michelle hey How’s your knee

MICHELLE
How’s your hand

He glances self-consciously at the bandage on his hand More
uncomfortable now He shrugs not knowing what to say

VINCENT
We were just talking about whether
it matters if a chocolate chip

cookie comes from Lithuania I say
it does

PATRICK
Im skeptical I guess

MICHELLE
Im withholding judgement

Michelle moves down the aisle stopping right in front of
Patrick He wonders what she’s going to say She reaches past
him to take down a can of sauce This makes him smile
Feeling more confident now-

PATRICK
Vincent says you guys haven’t
eaten Rebecca took off on a road

trip with her parents and left me

with like a metric ton of Lasagna

I’ll never eat by myself
(gestures with wine)

I was getting this to go with it

VINCENT
Sounds good to me

Michelle looks at Vincent back at Patrick She smiles Sure

INT PATRICK’S HOUSE -- NIGHT 128

Michelle Patrick and Vincent sit around a table eating
pasta The wine is flowing

MICHELLE
Where did Rebecca and her parents
go

PATRICK

They went to see the Pope in
Santiago de Compostella They’re
driving Insane if you ask me

MICHELLE
The Le Quesnoy Family

VINCENT
The Pope’s going to give mass at
the cathedral I have a hard time
imagining him barefoot It’s so
weird to think he’s like a real
person with feet

Patrick and Michelle both chuckle Vincent grins big the
wine already having an effect He reaches for the bottle

MICHELLE
Careful there sport

Vincent gives an “aw mom” look fills his glass

INT PATRICK’S HOUSE - DEN -- LATER 129

Patrick brings in coffee Vincent’s stretched out asleep on
the sofa

PATRICK
He’s out

MICHELLE
His eyes were bigger than his
liver

Patrick smiles sits down Michelle takes off her shoes He
watches her flex her bare feet

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
The floor’s warm

PATRICK
It’s a wood boiler I installed it
myself

MICHELLE

Sounds like a job

PATRICK
It was It holds fifty liters
Works by inverted flame combustion

MICHELLE
Inverted flame combustion That
sounds like a made-up thing

PATRICK
Finally something you don’t know

She grins He watches her She sees the way he’s watching
Finally as if it were some wild gambit he adds-

PATRICK (CONTD)
It’s in the basement

MICHELLE
Of course it is

PATRICK
Would you like to see it

A challenge A dare

MICHELLE
Yes

INT PATRICK’S HOUSE - HALL -- MOMENTS LATER 130

Michelle follows Patrick to the basement doorway He opens
it stands aside for her to down first She hesitates The
wood boiler ROARS down there The steps leading down are lit
only by the flicker of its hellish firelight Michelle looks
at him and takes the first step down

INT PATRICK’S HOUSE - BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS 131
Michelle separates from and Patrick as they reach the bottom

PATRICK
It’s loud but you can’t hear
anything with the door closed

She nods understanding all the implications of that She
stares inti the flames beyond the furnace’s grate

MICHELLE
(to herself)
It’s just you and me now

PATRICK
What

She shakes her head Turns to him He grabs her wrist

MICHELLE
No

He doesn’t listen He shoves her against the wall hard
sticking his knee between her legs She backs him off with a
pelvic thrust

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
Vincent’s upstairs

PATRICK
Yes Vincent’s upstairs

Patrick grabs her again by the hair She yowls He shoves
her to the floor toppling a laundry basket She slaps at him
frantically as he climbs on top of her She squirms and
punches but he holds her down rubbing himself against her
Suddenly Michelle stops fighting Plays dead Patrick now
inexplicably stops too He climbs off her looking by turns
frustrated embarrassed pouty Michelle look at him

PATRICK (CONTD)
It doesn’t work like that For me
It has to be like before

She just looks at him Patrick gets up to leave But before
he makes it to the stairs Michelle suddenly attacks him
Pummeling him as if spending all her frustration and rage on
him He turns around She whacks him across the face Now
it’s on again He shoves her down banging the back of her
head on the floor As she continues to viciously futilely
fight back he tears her bra and panties in the manner he’s
done before and slips inside her

It’s over pretty quickly He rolls off panting Satisfied

Michelle’s whole body convulses Impossible to tell if its
pleasure or sickness A scream builds inside her then
explodes She screams and screams Harrowing howls of pain
and primal release The screams freak out Patrick a little
When the screams subsides they turn into simple purging
tears Patrick looks around uncomfortably He reaches out to
comfort her but his hand stops halfway there and retreats

INT PATRICK’S HOUSE - DEN - A SHORT TIME LATER 132
Michelle lays a gentle hand on Vincent’s shoulder waking

him Michelle helps the groggy young man up Patrick pitches
in too

EXT PATRICK’S HOUSE -- NIGHT 133
Patrick sees them out Michelle gives him a smile

MICHELLE
Thank you for dinner

PATRICK
Anytime

Michelle nods to him and helps a wobbly Vincent back across
the street Patrick watches them the whole way

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- LATE NIGHT 134

Michelle sits by a fire looking at photos from the cardboard
box of things she collected from her mother’s Vincent
emerges from the guest room a bit hungover

VINCENT
What are you looking at

MICHELLE
Pictures From when I was a kid
want to see

From the look on Vincent’s face it’s clear this is an
unprecedented offer

VINCENT
Sure

Vincent tosses a fresh log in the fireplace and sits down
next to her Michelle holds a photo of herself as a child
holding a watering can in a garden

MICHELLE
That was in Nantes We lived there
till I was five I loved that
little red rain coat

VINCENT
Is that granny
MICHELLE
I know She looked like Amanda

Lear

She looks at another photo like that or two some in black
and white then comes upon one with her father in it He holds
her hand while she rides a merry-go-round Vincent looks at
Michelle to see her reaction She doesn’t betray much

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
There was a little carnival down the
street from our house on Pommeraye
street The carousel always gave me
a stomach ache but I loved it

She keeps flipping through the photos It’s just like a
mother and son looking at family photos

VINCENT
I didn’t know you took ballet

MICHELLE
(re her ballet position)
Id die if I tried that now

EXT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- NEAR DAWN 135

Michelle finishes digging a hole She dumps in the contents
of the box the photos everything Douses it all with
lighter fluid strikes the match to start the little bonfire
She looks content watching it burn

INT A BOUTIQUE -- DAY 136

Michelle emerges from a changing room with a very pricey
dress As she brings it up to a counter she grabs a cheap
bra and a package of panties a bundle of three She lays her
purchase on the counter before the SALESGIRL - who looks
politely askance

SALESGIRL
Did you did notice we have the lace
cotton Lejaby briefs on sale

MICHELLE
These are three for five dollars
Can’t beat that

The Salesgirl shrugs rings her up

INT A-V OFFICES -- DAY 137

On screen a winged vampiric female creature emerges from a
black chrysalis screaming The clip ends Lights come on

A small group gathered in front of the monitor applauds Some
high fives Michelle finds Kurt and holds out her hand

MICHELLE
Well done

Kurt looks a little reluctant to accept her praise but he
smiles and shakes her hand As the group breaks up Michelle
approaches Anna - who seems preoccupied

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
I had an idea about Vincent
We could give him the job
organizing the wrap party

ANNA
That is a good idea

Anna closes the conference room door

MICHELLE
I know in the past I always shot
down the idea of throwing Vincent
make-work but now

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
What is it

ANNA
Robert’s fucking someone

MICHELLE
(completely cool)
You know that

ANNA
I imagine I always knew abstractly

MICHELLE
And now

ANNA
I smelled it That sort of fruity
body wash they use in hotels that
are trying to be classy When
Robert travels he usually stays in
Motel sixes

MICHELLE
That’s all

ANNA
Then I smelled his underwear I
waited anxiously all day for him to
take off his jockey shorts and when
he finally did I pounced on them
Sniffing I was ashamed even before
I did it

Michelle looks at her friend with great understanding

MICHELLE
Shame is too weak an emotion to
prevent anything Anything at all

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- EVENING

This worries Michelle

Michelle is in her new cheap underwear getting dressed for
the party She sees that the length of a blue dress fails to
hide the bruises on her thighs so she goes with a red one

139 INT A-V OFFICES -- NIGHT 139

PARTY MUSIC drifts from further in An arriving Patrick
looking like he stepped out of a Sears catalogue hands his
coat to a girl at the improvised garderobe He bumps into
Richard whos doing the same thing

RICHARD
Hello You’re becoming a fixture at
these things

PATRICK
Looks like it

RICHARD
Your wife

PATRICK
She couldn’t make it

RICHARD
(knowingly)
Ah
PATRICK
Ah

Richard shakes his head Never mind

RICHARD
We should have come together We
couldve carpooled

Heading in they are met by Vincent a little stiff in a too-
tight suit but overflowing with bonhomie

VINCENT
Pretty classy spread huh Did you
see the candy dishes by the entrance
(noting Patrick) )
Hey how are you doing

Vincent shakes Patrick’s hand motions for them to follow

VINCENT (CONT’D)
Right this way monsieurs

PATRICK
Are you the maitre d’ tonight

VINCENT
My mother gave me the job of pretty
much organizing the whole party

RICHARD
I did notice the candy dishes
That’s a nice touch

VINCENT
That was my idea

Michelle making the rounds trades smiles with Anna who sits
at a table with Kurt and Robert She then sees Vincent
leading in Richard and Patrick past tables where people are
eating buffet-style and CONSOLES set up everywhere on which
guests can play the demo level of “Nocturnus”

As Michelle goes to meet them Robert follows her with his
eyes ignoring whatever Anna’s saying to him He glares and
pounds Scotch watching Michelle greet Patrick with a kiss

Michelle hugs Richard then nods to one of the game consoles

MICHELLE
Want to give it a try

PATRICK
I’m not really a game person

MICHELLE
No

Patrick looks a tad uncomfortable Richard jumps at the
chance to play

VINCENT
There’s no wine on the table

Vincent hastens to correct this Patrick takes a seat at the
table across from Robert not picking up on the vibes of
jealousy coming off the other man

At the bar Vincent accosts the RED-VEST BARTENDER

VINCENT (CONT’D)
A bottle of red

BARTENDER
I was told to pour everything in
glasses

VINCENT

I want a bottle

BARTENDER
I don’t know if I can do that

VINCENT
What

BARTENDER
was given very specific
instructions

VINCENT
need a bottle

BARTENDER
‘mM sorry

VINCENT
‘m supposed to be in charge of
this thing

At the table Michelle walks Richard through the game

MICHELLE
Press X and up at the same the same
time very fast faster

He’s not fast enough He dies He curses as he re-spawns

MICHELLE (CONTD)
Where’s Héléne I think we’re past
that aren’t we

RICHARD
I’m not sparing your feelings
She’s not with me because that’s
over

MICHELLE
(sincerely concerned)
What happened

He dies again in the game This time he stops playing
RICHARD
We were laying in bed and I asked

her which of my books was her
favorite

MICHELLE
Richard why

RICHARD
She said “Scent of Poplar”

Michelle draws a blank Richard smiles grimly

RICHARD (CONT’D)
“Scent of Poplar” is a novel
written by a Robert Casamayou

MICHELLE
I didn’t even know there was
another Jansen

RICHARD
Apparently he’s pretty good

MICHELLE
(with sympathy)
Richard

RICHARD
Poor Richard

They share smiles and walk away from the console Michelle
places a hand on Kevin’s shoulder in passing He stiffens as

if he were under arrest

MICHELLE
You should circulate

KEVIN
I will

He breathes again as Michelle smiles and moves on bringing
Richard to their table As she takes the seat next to him
Patrick is looking toward the bar where Vincent seems to be

having heated words with the bartender

MICHELLE
He’s a project in the early stages
of development

INT AV OFFICES - TABLE -- LATER
Anna is proposing a toast

ANNA
It looks like somehow despite all
our determined efforts we have a
success on our hands There’s no
explanation for it except for the
talent brilliance and extreme
dedication of everyone in this
room So all I can say is thank
you and I guess cheers

Everybody drinks Then people look at Michelle excepting her
to say something Someone from the techies’ table shouts
“speech” Michelle rises with her glass

MICHELLE
Ditto

Laughter drinking Sitting back down Michelle observes the
body language of Anna with Robert He’s holding court across
the table she’s trying not to be amused but he whispers in
her ear and gets a smile out of her The sight disturbs
Michelle

Vincent circles the table juggling a tray of glasses of red
wine placing them in front of people like a clumsy waiter

INT AV OFFICES -- LATER 141

People are dancing now The music is LOUD Patrick looks
mortified by the idea of but he lets Michelle drag him out of
his chair He takes her in his arms and attempting to move to
the music but he dances as if he were constipated

MICHELLE
It’s ok It’s alright

Patrick tries to loosen up his posture Resting against her
dance partner Michelle sees Robert watching them Seething
Like a pouting baby Robert stalks over to one of the
consoles and picks up a game controller

Michelle looks the other way and sees Anna dutifully
joylessly playing hostess To Patrick-

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
Excuse me

Michelle goes over to Anna Anna looks up cheerfully
Michelle doesn’t give her a chance to say anything

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
It’s me I’m the one Robert’s been
fucking I ended it but it happened

Anna remains hard to read There are no fireworks

ANNA
How long

MICHELLE
Half a year Eight months

Anna has tears in her eyes She nods

ANNA
Oh That’s great I really didn’t
have a clue

MICHELLE
I know

Anna finds she has nothing to say Before she can cry or do
anything embarrassing she walks away Michelle feels a
tremor She looks toward Patrick He motions “let’s get out
of here” She raises a finger “one moment” then walks in
the opposite direction

She passes Robert sitting there with the game controller in
his hands He witnessed Anna walking away upset

ROBERT
What did you do

MICHELLE
I stopped lying

Michelle keeps going She tracks down Vincent who is smoking
by a window with his tie loosened looking down She hands
Vincent her car keys He doesn’t understand

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
You can have the car Patrick’s
giving me a ride home

VINCENT
People are leaving already

MICHELLE
Vincent everything’s gone
beautifully You can relax now Go
talk to Kevin he’ll show you a
demo of the new Western game he’s
working on

VINCENT
Is that cool

Michelle nods Of course

INT PATRICK’S CAR -- NIGHT 142

Michelle and Patrick drive in ominous silence Michelle looks
over at him looks away He seems to sense her glance and
looks at her More silence Finally ahead Michelle sees her
house come into view

MICHELLE
It’s sick

Patrick looks at her not sure he heard her right

PATRICK
What

MICHELLE
It’s sick and wrong - what’s gone
on between us It’s diseased

Patrick looks very uncomfortable with this conversation

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
I was in some kind of weird denial
or I don’t know what But I’m
seeing clearly now

PATRICK
What are you seeing

MICHELLE
You can’t possibly expect to get
away with what you’ve done Can you

Patrick looks at her Sizing her up
MICHELLE (CONT’D)

I’m going to do what I should have
done the first day

PATRICK
What do you mean

MICHELLE
It’s not just me I have to think
about It’s your wife Other

women possibly God knows

PATRICK
What do you mean exactly

MICHELLE
How many others are there That
you’ve done the same thing too

The working of his jaw is the only sign of whatever’s going
on inside Patrick

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
Im going to the police I won’t
spare myself I’m going to tell
them everything

He stops the car right in the middle of the street He looks
at her working his jaw She looks him in the eyes then she
hits her door and gets out

EXT STREET -- NIGHT 143

Michelle walks toward her house in the middle of the street
lit by the headlights of his loudly idling car As if daring
him to run her over Only when she reaches her front walk
does Michelle turn back toward those sinister headlights

She gives him a look A silent “well”

Patrick kills his motor Now Michelle proceeds inside

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 144

Michelle leaves the door unlocked behind her She walks to
the middle of the room lets her jacket drop to the floor and
stands there waiting for him

She watches the front door excitement edging into impatience

Patrick however appears out of the back hallway Wearing
his black ski-mask

For a moment they just stand there like that Looking

Then Michelle breaks for the door and Patrick rushes to
intercept her She shoves an ottoman at him It hits his legs
but only slows him down by a couple of seconds Patrick grabs
her before she gets to the door Grabs her by the arm twists
her around and thumps her good right in the face sending
her sprawling to the floor

Michelle starts screaming- loudly- as Patrick falls on her
tearing at her clothes He fumbles with his zipper For a
second he has trouble She sees this and for just that
moment stops fighting back Like a time-out But a moment
later they’re back at it

She fights back tooth and nail She sinks her teeth into the
flesh above his wrist He howls and hits her again He rips
away her cheap panties with one good yank

She screams louder and louder as Patrick slides in between
her legs only stopping abruptly as she sees Vincent
standing behind Patrick

Patrick’s skull makes a loud CRACK as Vincent bludgeons him
with a fireplace log Before she can say boo

Michelle kicks free of Patrick’s body as it collapses on top
of her BLOOD oozes through the ski mask like cream through a
sieve Vincent gawks in horror as Patrick in dying spasms
Pulling the tatters of her dress around her Michelle’s first
and only thought is to hurry Vincent out of the room to
shield him from the horror

VINCENT
He’s Is he

MICHELLE
It’s alright You’re ok I’m
alright everything’s alright

Mother and son are both horrified as the masked figure now
rises slowly pulling himself to his feet Michelle positions
herself defensively in front of Vincent

But Patrick doesn’t come toward them He reaches up and pulls
off his mask Vincent is astonished to see who it is

Patrick looks as if he we trying to frame a question as blood
streams down one side of his face He turns looking for the
door He takes a half-step then collapses Almost a pratfall

VINCENT
Is he dead

Patrick lies there eyes open blood spreading like a halo
around his head across the parquet floor He is dead

MICHELLE
It’s alright It’s alright

She puts her arms around her son He holds onto her sobbing

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM -- LATER 145

The home is a crime scene AUTHORITIES surround the body
taking pictures making notes Michelle watches the activity
from where she’s being questioned by a DETECTIVE

DETECTIVE
What was your relationship with the
deceased

MICHELLE

He was my neighbor

DETECTIVE
A neighbor

MICHELLE
A neighbor

DETECTIVE
Like have a cup of coffee borrow a
lawnmower kind of neighbor

MICHELLE
There was never any exchange of
lawnmowers - but I get what you
mean and yes generally we were
neighbors like that Until maybe
recently

DETECTIVE
He had attended this party with you
as a date

MICHELLE
Yes

DETECTIVE
Youre relationship had turned
romantic

Distracted Michelle’s eyes are drawn to the crime scene

MICHELLE
It was heading in that direction

DETECTIVE
You returned together

MICHELLE
I told him I wasn’t feeling well
Thats why we left the party He
dropped me off out front I’m
sorry

She needs a moment She watches all the police activity

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
Ive been here before There’s deja
vu and then there’s this

A destroyed Vincent slumps on the couch surrounded by
officers One hands him a glass of water He guzzles it
Vincent notices the way the cop is looking at him He doesn’t
recognize the look at first

COP
Don’t beat yourself up son The
truth is you deserve a goddamn
medal for what you did

Vincent now recognizes the look approval admiration even
That sinks in Slowly he smiles Michelle watches Vincent
from across the room

MICHELLE
I went in started to get undressed
and he was there This figure
Standing there Wearing a mask

DETECTIVE
And did you have any clue that it
was your neighbor Mr Forrester

Looking at Vincent she knows what she has to do

MICHELLE
Who could imagine such a thing

146 INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- DAY 146

Michelle walks through the house Everything’s been
repainted Where Patrick died new carpeting She opens a
window to light a cigarette

She sees MOVING VANS across the street

147 EXT MICHELLE HOUSE -- DAY 147

Michelle comes out of the house Rebecca wearing black is
there directing the movers Her expression changes a little
when she sees Michelle approaching Uncertainty

REBECCA
Michelle

MICHELLE
You found a buyer

REBECCA
I took a little bit of a hit but
not bad My realtor did a wonderful
job - I can give you his name if
you like If you ever

MICHELLE
I’m not going anywhere

Rebecca smiles nods A mover passes with a chair

REBECCA
So much crap piles up

Michelle smiles politely briefly

MICHELLE
I wanted you to know I’m very sorry
for what you’ve been through

REBECCA
I claim to have faith What’s it
for if not to get through times
like this Patrick was a good man
but he had a tortured soul

Michelle nods again She’s about to politely exit but Rebecca
stops her adding one more thing-

REBECCA (CONT’D)
Im sincerely glad you were able to
give him what he needed For a
while anyway

Michelle looks at Rebecca The realization that this woman
knows the truth of Patrick’s death chills her Michelle nods
to the vans

MICHELLE
Good luck

Rebecca nods back Michelle leaves her

EXT CEMETERY -—- DAY 148

Michelle puts flowers in front of her mother’s little vault
built into an onyx wall She pointedly ignores the unmarked
vault next to it that contains her father Vandals have
already scrawled “monster” and “burn in hell” on that one

Michelle turns and finds she’s not alone Anna’s there

ANNA
I heard you were here

MICHELLE
Physically anyway

They stand silently side by side

ANNA
We’re going ahead with Richards
project

MICHELLE
I’m going to let him fool around for
a while

(MORE)

MICHELLE (CONTD)
I expected him to throw my charity
back in my face but he didn’t
Something’s gone out of him

ANNA
Robert showed up drunk at the
office this morning Security
escorted him out What did you
see in him anyway

MICHELLE
It was more about happenstance
opportunity I just wanted to get

laid

ANNA
That’s no excuse It was very
shabby

MICHELLE

It was that and worse

ANNA
Vincent’s grown up It’s just the
two of us now And I’m stuck with
that mausoleum of a house I’m
going to sell it I was thinking
I could move in with you for a
while

Michelle looks at Anna unsure of the implication

MICHELLE
Oh

They look at each other Anna impulsively kisses Michelle
Michelle kisses her back

For two seconds Then both women spontaneously burst out
laughing

END
MICHELLE (INTO PHONE)
-Yes I’d like two pieces of the
Hamachi as well and what
exactly is the “Holiday Roll”

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - ENTRYWAY -- DAY 6

Michelle opens her front door and lets in her 19-year-old
son VINCENT a bear of a young man with scrappy facial hair
a back-pack on his shoulder She greets him with a brief hug

VINCENT
I know I’m late They kept me at
work a fucking extra hour
(walking on with her he
sees something’s amiss)
Are you ok You look like you got a
black eye starting

MICHELLE
I fell off my bike

VINCENT
That bike

The young man nods to a brand new-looking bike they’re
passing leaned against the entryway wall

VINCENT (CONTD)
It doesn’t look like you’ve been
riding it at all

MICHELLE
(gestures to her face)
And you see why

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- DEN -- LATER 7

They’re sitting at the coffee table eating Sushi Vincent
uses the chopsticks in conjunction with his fingers Michelle
isn’t eating at the moment she’s watching his Iphone (We
glimpse a Youtube snippet a child at Sea World) Vincent
watches his mother expecting a big laugh But as the video
ends Michelle looks merely confused

MICHELLE
So the kid was scared of the
penguin

VINCENT

The music’s what makes it so great
MICHELLE
It’s arguably cruelty to animals

VINCENT
Nah- you think
(takes back his phone)
Sorry I was late We’re short-—
handed at work

MICHELLE
You’ve managed to avoid mentioning
what this job actually is

VINCENT
It’s entry level I told you But
there’s a path to management I’m
like an assistant manager

MICHELLE
Is this a MacDonald’s or something

VINCENT
(amazed she guessed)
But it’s a management position Like
I said I brought you a present

Quickly changing the subject Vincent hops up pulls a gold
gift box from his back-pack with great pride

VINCENT (CONTD)
It’s from Josie really It was all
her idea

Michelle smiles thinly She opens the box Inside a FRAMED
PHOTO Vincent is stiffly posed before a cheesy back-drop
beside a massively pregnant girl (JOSIE)

MICHELLE
You look quite handsome

VINCENT
Were going to go back and take
another picture after the babys
born You can put ‘em side by side
Itll be like a before and after

He moves a candle stick on the mantle to the side to make
room for the photo

VINCENT (CONTD)
Josies got all kinds of ideas
about interior decorating Of
course shes never had her own
place to decorate Till now
Michelle lowers her head knowing where this is going

VINCENT (CONTD)
Shell be able to try her hand a
little bit I guess now that were
getting our own place

She watches him sit back down going back to eating Sushi

using the chopsticks in conjunction with his fingers

MICHELLE
How much are you going to need for
this new apartment

VINCENT
I didnt ask you for money

MICHELLE
Did I jump the gun

VINCENT
I was going to ask you to co-sign
the lease but I wasnt going to ask
you for money necessarily

MICHELLE
Are any of Josies other paramours
moving in with you too

VINCENT
No

(realizing that came off
like an answer respecting
the question)

No Why would you say something
like that

Vincent spills some Wasabi on his lap Michelle gets up to

get him another napkin

MICHELLE
You dont know anything about this
manifestly dysfunctional girl
Except that she was raised by
unwashed idiots in a commune

VINCENT
It was an Arts collective

In passing Michelle moves the candlestick back in front
the photo

of
MICHELLE
She didn’t see toilet paper until
she was ten By her own admission

She returns to her chair gives him the napkin

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
I suppose it’s progress she now
suddenly wants the most bourgeois
life imaginable- you’ve really
never wondered about this Why she
glommed onto you What she’s after

VINCENT
(cleaning himself up)
What could she be “after” I dont
have money

MICHELLE
I do

VINCENT
You know I cant listen to this
Youre insulting my family

MICHELLE
(hands him napkin)
Your father sets his jaw just like
that when hes laying down the law
It doesnt work for you yet Give
it some time

VINCENT
(hurt embarrassed)
I dont know whats with you today

She looks at him thinking about telling him Then

MICHELLE
I’1l give you three months rent On
condition I look at the place
first

VINCENT
I didn’t want to pressure you If
you really don’t feel

MICHELLE
You won When you strike oil stop
drilling

Vincent smiles goes back to eating sushi ditching the
chopsticks Michelle watches him with a slight smile

EXT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- NIGHT 8

Michelle waves goodbye to Vincent as he drives away Far down
the street a few Xmas lights twinkle

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - GARAGE -- NIGHT 9

Michelle rummages through a tool box until she finds a HAMMER

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT 10

Michelle makes a sweep of the house holding the hammer She
concernedly checks the pantry door It’s slightly warped so

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - BEDROOM -- LATER THAT NIGHT 11

Michelle is asleep in the light of her TV the hammer on the
pillow next to her

INT OFFICES OF A-V SOFTWARE -- DAY 12

Immaculately dressed for power Michelle strides past
cubicles filled with busy employees side by side with ANNA
her Co-CEO a well-put together woman her own age

ANNA
Have you seen this apartment
Vincent picked out

MICHELLE
Six months ago he was dealing weed
and getting into imbecilic fights

ANNA
That bitch JOSIE is a menace He
just doesnt see it

INT A-V SOFTWARE - CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY 13

The group is watching a highly polished GAME DEMO projected
at the front of the room software engineer PHILLIP KWAN
acting as the player On the screen a Lovecraftian
creaturess tentacle penetrates the skull of a helplessly
writhing woman She stops struggling as her eyes turn black
MICHELLE
Phillip werent we going to dial
back the orgasmic convulsions
though

ANNA
These guys never heard of subtext
Michelle smiles There are some
murmurs from others at the table

PHILLIP
(defensive)
There was forty-five seconds of
animation on that originally

KURT
Are we not going to address the
white elephant in the room

KURT a German-born game designer with long hair and many
tattoos now stands and takes the floor

KURT (CONTD)

We get one shot at Activision but
the wonkiness of the controls make
this critical demonstration tool
almost unplayable It doesnt
matter how intricately rendered the
environments of Thule are if the
players throwing his controller
through the fucking screen

MICHELLE
It seems to me youre dodging the
issue by blaming known glitches

KURT
Im confronting the issue head-on
The issue is you come from the
world of publishing and literary
fiction and thats a singularly
inappropriate background for
evaluating playability
Everyone in the room looks a little
shocked he said this Michelle
takes it in stride

MICHELLE
It may well be that Anna and I
should have founded a different
sort of company

(MORE )
MICHELLE (CONTD)
It may be as you suspect that
Kronos was a hit solely because of
your innovations and were bitches
who got lucky - but the fact is I
am the boss and were six months
behind here
(to all as Kurt seethes)
We all know the goal when the
player guts an Orc he has to feel
hot blood pouring over his hands
Kevin a cherubic red-haired young
man turns to Michelle

KEVIN
I love you

Everybody laughs Even Michelle
smiles
14 INT AV OFFICES - OUTER OFFICE -- DAY 14
Michelle and Anna walk together toward the elevators

MICHELLE
Sometimes I think Kurt hates me

ANNA
He does hate you They all hate
you Except Kevin- who really does
love you even though he tries to
pass it off as a joke This isn’t
a shock You knew all this right

Michelle shrugs They share a little laugh

15 INT A DOCTOR’S OFFICE -- DAY 15

A NURSE draws blood Michelle wears a lime-green gown She
turns to the young DOCTOR making notes in her chart nearby

MICHELLE
Does she know I want a full STD
panel

DOCTOR

Yes she does

(smiles briefly)
If you’re concerned about a recent
exposure I can prescribe a PEP

MICHELLE
I googled those They have nasty
side effects and I can’t miss any
work So I guess I’1ll just have to
roll the dice

The Doctor disapproves but Michelle starts getting dressed

INT A CAFE -- DAY 16

Michelle looks over creature design sketches Her phone
RINGS She answers A MALE VOICE (ROBERT) on the other end-

MAN (0S)
My evening just cleared up

MICHELLE (INTO PHONE)
It’s not good for me Actually
I’m having Female Difficulties

MAN (0S)
Ill wear a condom

MICHELLE (INTO PHONE)
I appreciate your willingness to
sacrifice but tonight’s not good

As Michelle returns to her drawings another cafe patron a
big grey-haired WOMAN keeps throwing funny looks Michelles
way Angry looks Now the woman rises from her table with her
tray and on her way out makes a detour over to Michelles
table She proceeds to deliberately spill the contents of her
tray - half-eaten food and paper products - right into
Michelles lap Michelle strangely takes it completely in
stride She doesnt even act all that surprised

The woman glaring at Michelle sets her tray down and walks
out Michelle dabs a napkin in water scrubs her blouse

INT MICHELLE’S MOTHER’S APARTMENT -- DAY 17

Michelle lets herself in Shes surprised to discover her
mother IRENE having coffee in the breakfast nook with a
gigolo-esque guy in early middle age (RAFE) The man wears a
dress shirt and boxer shorts

Michelle sighs heavily and shakes her head Her mother a
woman in her late 70s with layers of plastic surgery shows
mild annoyance

IRENE
If you’re going to come in without
knocking you’re going to be
treated to gruesome sights like me
having coffee with a friend

RAFE
But I did wish I had pants on

The gigolo excuses himself smiling Michelle glares at him

MICHELLE
How much do you pay them So
demeaning

IRENE

I have nothing to be ashamed of
This is my life My sex life
You’re just a little bitch

MICHELLE
All I’m saying is you’re on a fixed
income You should be more
economical Do you really need a
young stud at your age

IRENE
Did you eat I made spaghetti

MICHELLE
Ill take some coffee

Irene goes to get it as Michelle sits down at the table

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
Did you have more work done

IRENE
Youre just going to keep going

MICHELLE
I’m sorry

Irene brings over the coffee

IRENE
A little Botox

MICHELLE
It’s your business
(sips her coffee)
Very good
IRENE
You act surprised

Rafe comes back in fully dressed

RAFE
Well that’s better Michelle I
hope we get a chance to meet
properly soon I have to take off

IRENE
Not yet you’re not

She slinks over to him sexy for a lovers’ goodbye
Michelle openly disgusted has to look away

MICHELLE
Did my mother tell you she’s HIV
positive

IRENE
I already warned him you were going
to try that one

Michelle shrugs Rafe smiles at her

RAFE
Nice meeting you

He takes off Irene returns to the table

IRENE
I’m going to ask you a question I
want you to think before you
answer What would you say if I
remarried Think about it

MICHELLE
It’s simple- I’d kill you No need
to think about it

Irene shakes her head lights a cigarette
IRENE

Youve always wanted some sanitized
version of life Michelle

MICHELLE
I would kill you You asked I told
you

IRENE

You’re so selfish Michelle It’s
frightening

kiss

MICHELLE
I know Here’s the check for your
mortgage payment by the way

Michelle takes a check from her purse hands it over

IRENE
You never give anything truly of
yourself Like with your father
How much effort would it take

MICHELLE
Don’t

IRENE
He’s an old man Michelle

MICHELLE
Well he’s still breathing so not
old enough apparently

IRENE
There’s are some connections that
can never be broken

MICHELLE
I walk through the door here

IRENE
-Never No matter what

MICHELLE
and it’s one horror after another

IRENE
He’s having another parole hearing
next week

MICHELLE
Enough OK

Irene looks hurt Michelle sips her coffee notices something
by her chair She holds it up

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
Your stud forgot his hernia belt

EXT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- DUSK 18
Getting groceries out of her car Michelle is politely

accosted by her neighbor REBECCA a very pretty large-
bosomed woman in her mid-30s Conservatively dressed perky

REBECCA
Michelle glad I caught you I’m
putting these on everybody’s door
(presses a Flyer in
Michelle’s hand)
Its about the neighborhood
coucils new trash-separation
policy

MICHELLE
Oh thank you

Rebecca’s handsome husband PATRICK - a man with the look of
a high school quarterback just starting to go to seed - is
wrestling a large Xmas creche out of his car’s hatch-back

REBECCA
Theyre levying a pretty steep fine
now if recycleables arent properly
sorted and were having a block
meeting Wednesday to organize our
opposition

MICHELLE
But youre on the council arent
you

PATRICK
Ive tried to point that out to her
that its hard to be we and
they at the same time

MICHELLE
Its an interesting position
anyway

REBECCA

Thats how I like to look at it

Michelle smiles politely and finds herself sharing an amused
little look with the man carrying the creche She gives
Rebecca another smile and tosses the flyer in the car before
she shuts the door

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- NIGHT 19
Michelle comes in A LOCKSMITH works on the front door
LOCKSMITH

This is the last one Your new set
of keys is there on the table

MICHELLE
Great Thank you Did you notice
the side door doesn’t close properly

LOCKSMITH
The wood’s warped Might be
possible to shim under the hinge
plates fix it that way

MICHELLE
Oh

LOCKSMITH
I don’t do that I just do locks

Michelle nods Of course

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- LATER THAT NIGHT 20

Michelle sits on her stairs absently stroking Marty the cat
staring at the entry hall where the rape took place

FLASHBACK TO- INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- DAY 21

Michelle is walking through the living room with a cup of
coffee She hears the cat loudly WHINING She follows the
sound and sees that the pantry door is standing slightly

ajar Michelle puts down her coffee and goes out onto the
side patio to retrieve the cat Marty jumps into her arms

MICHELLE
How’d you get out there numbskull

Michelle tries to close the door but finds she’s having
trouble The weather-warped door won’t close properly Shes
in the middle of her third attempt when the door suddenly
bursts inward knocking her back making her drop the cat

A MASKED INTRUDER now steps into the house Eyeing her
flings the door closed behind him

For a moment Michelle is frozen by terror Then the Intruder
takes a step toward her and she rediscovers her legs She
runs but the Intruder catches up to her in the hall She’s no
physical match for the much bigger man and soon all she can
do is keep screaming as the Intruder takes her Marty
watching on an indifferent witness

BACK TO- INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- NIGHT 22

Michelle closes her eyes opens them Like a ritual purging
She holds up the cat makes him looks at her

MICHELLE
If you couldn’t claw his eyes out
you could’ve at least scratched
him I’m just saying

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - STUDY -- NIGHT 23

Michelle is looking at a preliminary animation on her laptop
More Lovecraftian monsters She gets a TEXT MESSAGE

She looks at her phone Unknown caller

Just as she’s about to retrieve the message her phone dies
She curses to herself as she has to get up and plug in her
charger It takes a moment for the phone to reboot

When it does she finds an ominous message staring at her
“You were tight for a woman your age”

Michelle feels ice water down her spine She moves to the
window looks out A few more Xmas lights twinkle in the
street but nothing stirs

INT GUN SHOP -- DAY 24

Michelle talks with an orange-vested SALES ASSOCIATE in front
of a case filled with PEPPER SPRAYS She’s handling one

MICHELLE
So this is the most powerful

SALES ASSOCIATE
With pepper sprays power can be
measured in terms of potency and in
terms of distance

MICHELLE
I want both
INT GUN SHOP -- MOMENTS LATER 25

On her way to the checkout counter Michelle passes a display
of HATCHETS She tosses one of those in her basket too

EXT STREET -- DUSK 26

audible CRUNCH She keeps going anyway forcibly moving the
other car to make room for hers

INT RESTAURANT -- DUSK 27

Entering Michelle finds RICHARD her ex a ruggedly handsome
man around fifty already here They kiss

RICHARD
You want to sit outside We can sit
down right now

MICHELLE
Fine with me

Richard motions to the HOSTESS She nods back to him Richard
and Michelle follow her through the restaurant

RICHARD
So you told Vincent you’d front him
the rent on that place

MICHELLE
I said I’d help for a while

RICHARD
Well I hope you’re not expecting
me to pitch in I’m fucking broke

MICHELLE
I was the one who made the promise

They arrive at a table The Hostess sets out menus

RICHARD
I don’t know what possessed you
They should struggle a while It’d
be good for him

MICHELLE
His psychotic won’t tolerate any
struggling

RICHARD
She is a psycho I will add
though that kind of girl is often
very good in bed

The Hostess smiles to herself as she opens napkins for them

MICHELLE

What does that mean anyway “Good

in bed” I’ve never known

The Hostess splits Michelle sits down

RICHARD
Did you get a chance to read my
proposal yet

Michelle seems distracted as she settles in at the table

MICHELLE
Richard would you say I was tight
for a woman my age

Richard’s taken aback by the question Before he can answer

they’re joined by Anna and her husband ROBERT

ROBERT
What up loser

INT RESTAURANT -- DUSK

RICHARD
(amid the hugs kisses)
Youre just in time to hear
Michelle avoid telling me what she
thought of the game idea I pitched
to her

MICHELLE
No - it was very interesting

ROBERT
(to Bus Boy)
Four glasses of champagne no a
bottle

Anna sits next to Michelle She can tell there’s something

wrong She mouths “are you ok” Michelle half-smiles

distantly

RICHARD
It is interesting Its set ina
time when dogs have been wiped out
by a virus so people have robotic
canines as pets You play as the
Spartacus of the robot-dog world

Bob fakes being impressed Michelle makes a sound as if she
were going to speak but then clams up All look at her

MICHELLE
I was trying to I was going to
try to find a way to segue into
this organically but there really
is no graceful way so I’m just
going to dump it on the table I
was assaulted a couple of days ago
In my home I guess I was raped

ANNA
Oh my god

RICHARD
Raped

ANNA
Oh my God

ROBERT
Seriously

RICHARD
A couple of days ago

MICHELLE
Thursday Night

RICHARD
You don’t say anything

ANNA
Oh my God

MICHELLE
I really haven’t known what to
say What is there to say I feel

stupid now for bringing it up

RICHARD
Are you insane

The Waiter finally comes over
WAITER
Have we had time to look at the

menu

Robert looks at his menu as if they were actually going to
do that now but then he reads the table To the waiter-
ROBERT
Give us a minute huh

The Waiter reads the table too and quickly withdraws

ROBERT (CONTD)
Were talking about a real rape
here

ANNA
A real rape

ROBERT
She knows what I meant

ANNA
I don’t think you do

ROBERT
Don’t get political now Your
closest friend was just raped

Apparently You were For real
MICHELLE
It was real He wore a mask and
everything
RICHARD

Jesus Christ You’re telling us
this now

MICHELLE
I’m telling you now

No one knows what to say A moment of silence

ANNA
Are you alright You have to get a
medical exam

MICHELLE
I took care of all that I gota
full blood panel

RICHARD
What have the cops told you
(off her look)
You haven’t reported this

ANNA
Michelle you have to report this
to the police Immediately

MICHELLE
Why

ANNA
Why

MICHELLE

It’s over It doesn’t need to be
talked about anymore It doesn’t
need to be commemorated in any

way Let’s order something
Anything
EXT RESTAURANT -- NIGHT 29

A grim Richard walks out with Michelle They exchange solemn
waves with Anna and Robert going off the other way

RICHARD
Where’s your car

She nods the way They walk in silence a moment

RICHARD (CONTD)
If you’re reluctant to go to the
police because

MICHELLE
Of course I’m reluctant to go to
the police because I’m never
dealing with police ever again
That was my vow

This seems to make sense to him for some reason

RICHARD
I’m going to get you a gun

MICHELLE
I don’t believe in guns
(cutting him off)
Richard I should tell you I shared
your proposal with our financiers
They weren’t interested

RICHARD
I don’t want to talk about that
now

MICHELLE
Alright

She opens her car door with her key

RICHARD
But I guess now I might as well ask
what you thought of it

MICHELLE
Don’t take it hard It doesn’t have
anything to do with the quality of
your work It’s a business that’s
very tied into a particular
demographic

RICHARD
A demographic that doesn’t care if
something’s good

MICHELLE
Pretty much

RICHARD
You don’t have to shield me
Really what did you think of it

MICHELLE
I think you should finish your
novel You’re a real writer

RICHARD
A penniless real writer

He stops noticing her color paint on his front bumper
MICHELLE

Looks like somebody dented your
fender

RICHARD
(smiling)
If I get my hands on the punk

Michelle gives him a smile and kiss gets in her car

EXT MCDONALD’S -- DAY 30
Michelle pulls up Vincent emerges from the interior in his
McDonalds uniform carrying a McFlurry - which he hands to
his mother as he climbs in
VINCENT
On the house I made it myself

He seems proud of that Michelle smiles thanks

31 INT EMPTY APARTMENT -- DAY 31

A man in an impeccable suit opens the door for Michéle and
Vincent

MAN
Mrs Leblanc yes I am the
apartment manager Please come in

They follow him to the main room where an extremely pregnant
woman Josie is measuring a corner with a tape measure

JOSIE
Hello Michéle Vin could you hold
this for a moment

Vincent takes the end of the tape measure Josie stretches it
out

JOSIE (CONT’D)
The bookcase is 150 centimeters
so there like that Can you
stand there so I can see

She positions Vincent so that he’s a stand-in for the book
case He’s contientously very still as she extends his arm

VINCENT
Right here

JOSIE
Don’t just act like the bookcase
Be the bookcase

She measures down from his extended arm to the floor

MICHELLE
(smiling)
Vincent is quite the actor When he
was 12 he was a model for “Kronos”
our first game

JOSIE
Ah And I’m sure you were great

She kisses him furtively and then again intensively Vincent -
in the presence of his mother - feels akward He makes a
grand gesture towards the room

VINCENT
Nice huh

MICHELLE
A little too nice dont you think

Vincent demeanor goes gloomy instantly Josie continues with
her measuring tape

JOSIE (TO VINCENT)
Theres room for a 50 inch here
Did you ask her

Michelle looks to Vincent Ask me what

VINCENT
You know how you were going to buy
us a microwave We were hoping
maybe you could save your money on
that and give us a tv as the
housewarming present instead

MICHELLE
Dont you need an oven more than a
new TV

JOSIE

(pausing to precisely

write down measurements)
The unit comes with a microwave a
refrigerator everything

MICHELLE
It does Is this the same apartment
you told me about

Vincent looks ashamed The manager speaks up-

APARTMENT MANAGER
No its not This is one of our
elite units This is 250 euros a
month more

JOSIE
(going back to measuring)
The other one there was ridiculous
There was nowhere to put a crib
even It was preposterous

MICHELLE
A little uncomfortable maybe

JOSIE
Yeah Uncomfortable

MICHELLE
You do realize having a child is
all about suffering

(MORE)

MICHELLE (CONTD)
When Vincent was born it was three
hours of torture before they gave
up and cut him out of me At that
point I wouldve gutted myself
with the jagged end of a broken
beer bottle to end the pain

Josie meets Michelles gaze flatly

JOSIE
If you dont want to help us dont
help us Nobodys holding a gun to
your head

MICHELLE
If I dont help you how are you
going to live

JOSIE
Thats our problem

MICHELLE
No- no you see you dont get to
do that You dont get to act
fiercely independent while taking
my money

JOSIE

None of this shit was my idea

(to Vincent)
I know you want to show off and
make all these big nice things
happen but Jesus at some point
you have to deliver right A
little Something Once It’s
always total bullshit Whatever way
things are going to be is never the
way they are

She chokes up throws down the tape measure and stalks away
Fuming impotently Vincent hits the wall

APARTMENT MANAGER
Hey hey hey

Vincent instantly turns from raging bear to shamed child

MICHELLE
This is impossible You realize
that Shes a lunatic and youre

VINCENT
What What am I Its like you
dont see Ive changed

MICHELLE
(softening)
Ill cosign like I said I would but
youre going to be responsible
every month for the difference in
rent between this apartment and the
one wed talked about

VINCENT
Absolutely Theres no problem Im
ready for this

Michelle knows better but she nods Vincent immediately goes
to Josie who’s crying in the next room He approaches her
gingerly

VINCENT (CONTD)
It’s ok It’s done Everythings
going to be just how you want it

JOSIE
(her hands on her belly)
How I want it It’s not for me Do
you not understand anything It’s
not about me

Vincent looks frustrated He can’t do anything right Josie
sees his anguish instantly relents She hushes him takes
him in her arms Michelle - on her way out - watches through
the doorway as Josie strokes Vincent’s head maternally
Michelle looks fascinated

INT A-V OFFICES -- DAY 32

Michelle watches a group of kids shooting zombies Some kind
of beta-testing focus group As she moves on she sees Robert
coming down the corridor toward her

MICHELLE
You missed Anna She’s in
Anguouléme today

Robert smiles Michelle sighs internally seeing his smile

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
But you knew that

Michelle continues into her office He follows her in closes
the door behind them Michelle settles in behind her desk

MICHELLE (CONTD)
You know I went through a very
traumatic experience days ago

ROBERT
You gave the impression you wanted
to go on like nothing happened
If I’m being insensitive I’m
sorry but that’s my thing right

MICHELLE
I appreciate you staying in
character

ROBERT
(comes closer)
And you know a big part of my
role is being unpredictable Don’t
scream

He unzips his pants whips it out Michelle sighs
ROBERT (CONTD)
I know you’re a wilting flower but
you can still touch it Can’t you

She looks up at him Sees he’s not going to be dissuaded

MICHELLE
Hold on

She reaches over and grabs her waste-basket Positions it to
catch his wayward sperm

INT A-V OFFICES -- NIGHT 33

The entire suite is dark and silent The only light is the
one in Michelle’s office

INT MICHELLE’S OFFICE -- NIGHT 34

Michelle is going over an intimidatingly numbers-heavy tech
review with a yellow highlighter The only sound is the hum
of the heating system Until her phone DINGS

A text message She glances at the clock 230 AM She looks
at her phone “Unknown Caller” She looks at the message

That cream blouse is lovely my cum stains will hardly show
See you soon

Michelle whips toward the window behind her Nothing out
there but the dark glass of another office building A
thought chills her and she looks at her door Her unlocked
door

She crosses to it hesitates then pulls the door open as if
expecting to surprise someone on the other side

INT OUTER OFFICES - CONTINUOUS 35

Michelle emerges slowly She has a look around the dark
silent suite of offices She seems to be alone but at the
end of a row of cubicles she sees a light spilling from a
half-open door marked “studio” She quietly sneaks up on that
doorway Peering in she sees Kurt in the light of a single
lamp posing a featureless doll and taking pictures

A figure study of some sort He doesn’t seem to notice
Michelle She decides not to announce herself and withdraws

EXT QUAI BESIDE THE SEINE -- DAY 36

Michelle and Irene rise from finishing their meal at one of
the little restaurants

MICHELLE
I was going to ask- have you
experienced any incidents recently

IRENE
Incidents

MICHELLE
You know what I mean

IRENE
A man threw a slice of pizza at me
from his car It missed Also I felt
a couple of eyes on me in the market
perhaps But I always feel that

MICHELLE
I just wonder if isn’t starting
again A new cycle

IRENE
You don’t know Tru Tv just made a
new “special documentary” about
your father They’re repeating it
all hours every day That’s why
it’s fresh on people’s minds

MICHELLE
(reeling)
I didn’t know I don’t watch TV

IRENE
Has something happened to you

MICHELLE
No Nothing really Just looks from
people on the street The usual

IRENE
It’s because of his parole hearing
That’s their excuse for dredging
the whole thing up again Your
father’s going before the panel in
two days

MICHELLE
You don’t miss a beat

IRENE
I want you to come with me

MICHELLE
They will never let him out Thank
God This parole hearing is nothing
but a kabuki exercise just like you
asking me to go with you when you
know Id rather claw my own eyes out

IRENE
How long are you going to hang onto
this hatred

MICHELLE
I will never see him again Not in
this world or well there is no
other world so I’1l just leave it
at that

IRENE
There isn’t much time left
Michelle He’s ill Look
(pulling a PHOTO from her
purse like a weapon)
Just look Are you afraid to look
at your own father

Michelle looks defiantly The photo is of an ordinary man
bald thin a bit stooped Wearing an orange prison jumpsuit

MICHELLE
There Put it away now

IRENE
You’re not like all the others
Michelle people who only know the
monster from TV You know the man
He’s just a man

MICHELLE
And he’s a monster You think
there’s a contradiction there
Look I’m done I’1ll see you later

Michelle walks off

IRENE
Just be careful Some people aren’t
content with throwing rude things
from passing cars

Michelle keeps walking By the time she reaches the street
where her car is parked Michelle’s already looking around a
little paranoid She clocks the faces of her fellow
pedestrians wondering which ones might mean her harm

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- DAY 37
Marty the Cat CRIES pitifully

MICHELLE (0S)
How’d you get out there numbskull

Michelle opens the pantry door scoops her cat in her arms

As she turns the Intruder is there in front of her He grabs
her Just as we’ve seen before but what we haven’t seen
before she gets her hands on the iron on the table next to
her Screaming she clobbers him The Intruder lets go of
her grabbing his head in pain That’s his fatal mistake
Michelle hits him again His blood sprays across the wall
Michelle an animal now falls on the Intruder bringing the
iron down Over and over screaming

CUT TO- INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - STUDY -- DAY 38
Michelle smiles to herself weakly She turns back to the
work on the desk in front of her Rotted faces - concept
drawings of zombies She considers a moment then circles the
zombie on the left

A loud THWACK startles her Makes the pen jump in her hand

Michelle grabs the hatchet - which apparently she keeps
near her at all times - and goes to check out the sound

Her heart skips a beat when she discovers a CRACK in her side
sliding glass door

She ducks back behind the wall peeks out cautiously and
now sees the injured BIRD that collided into the glass
twitching on the patio Thoroughly creeped-out Michelle puts
down her hatchet and fetches a broom She opens the sliding
door flicks the dying bird onto the grass then quickly
shuts it again as if afraid it were going to try to get in

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER 39

Michelle lights a cigarette A moment later she’s drawn back
to the sliding glass door To her horror she sees that the
bird is still alive and about to be devoured by Marty who is
sadistically toying with it Michelle rushes out with the
broom to shoo the cat away

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- LATER 40

Michelle holds the bird swaddled in a towel as she talks on
the phone with a VET

MICHELLE (INTO PHONE)
I understand you can’t make a
prognosis over the phone I was
just exploring whether in fact
treating birds was something that
was possible

VET (0S)
We’re talking about a wild bird

MICHELLE (INTO PHONE)
Yes An ordinary brown bird

VET (0S)
Like a sparrow

MICHELLE (INTO PHONE)
Sparrows are pretty aren’t they

VET (0S)
Well that’s subjective

MICHELLE (INTO PHONE)
Is it

VET (0S)
Honestly ma’am I wouldn’t even
know how to intubate a sparrow- or
whatever it is

Michelle mms She looks at the bird very still in her arms
but breathing rhythmically

MICHELLE (INTO PHONE)
Do sleeping pills work on birds

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN -- EVENING 41

Michelle grinds up sleeping pills and mixes them in a cup
with some Chia seeds

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - DEN -- NIGHT 42

Michelle watches TV The bird in its towel-swaddling rests
in her lap She absently strokes its head with her thumb As
she scrolls through channels something on her cable guide
catches her off-guard Bloodline the Legave Street Murders
Michelle’s remote hand stays tensely suspended in mid-air a
moment before she presses “OK”

A TV documentary faded footage of an improbably long line of
body bags on a suburban sidewalk what looks like a swastika
scrawled in blood on a door

NARRATOR (0S)
little knowing the horror that
unfolded or the questions that
they would be left to answer

Michelle braces for the next image a SLOW ZOOM-IN on an old
photo of a nondescript balding man with his arm around a
woman- who is clearly a younger version of Michelle’s mother

NARRATOR (CONTD)
What would drive George Leblanc
successful entrepreneur alderman
at his local church loving husband
and father to commit such horrific
and senseless acts

The zoom PANS DOWN to the CHILD in Irene’s lap 10-YEAR-OLD
MICHELLE

NARRATOR (CONTD)
A single night of madness that
would forever haunt those closest
to him

They cut to a much more recent Michelle - recognizable as
herself but less fashionable - being attacked by
PHOTOGRAPHERS in a parking lot

REPORTER (ON TV)
Have you talked to your father

She strikes the cameraman

NARRATOR (0S)
Decades of court proceedings and
psychiatric interviews have shed
but dim light on the events

Michelle dials down the volume but keeps the picture on as
the image DISSOLVES to another photo of herself as a child
In it she’s standing in front of a suburban house lit by
the flash of a news camera looking lost covered in ash like
a Dickensian chimney-sweep

As the documentary cuts to footage of some kind of memorial -
children tying red ribbons to the mail boxes of houses -
Michelle finally turns it off When she looks down she sees
that the bird in her lap is dead

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - PANTRY -- MOMENTS LATER 43

Michelle carefully places the dead bird in a shoe box

EXT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- NIGHT 44

Michelle takes the shoe box out to the trash cans There are
more Xmas lights now filling the street with gaudy color As
she closes the lid of the can from across the street-—

PATRICK
We have to stop meeting like this

Patrick is dragging his own trash can out to the curb
Michelle not wanting to get dragged into a corny running
joke with the neighbor gives a polite chuckle Waves

Heading back into the house Michelle notices a CAR gliding
down this quiet street It’s unfamiliar to her from the way
she watches it pass Just before Michelle reaches her front
door she sees the strange car very suspiciously turn off its
lights and make a U-turn Before parking in the dark across
the street

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 45
Michelle locks and bolts the door behind her She hurries to

the living room window Whoever is in the car is just sitting
there in the dark

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER 46

Michelle sits with her hatchet and her pepper spray as if
waiting for a showdown Nothing happens and nothing continues
to happen She can’t take it anymore She goes to the window

That suspicious car is still there A cigarette’s glow wax
and wanes behind the steering wheel

EXT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER 47

Michelle comes out the side door with a flashlight (not
turned on) and the pepper spray She hugs the side of the
house moving like a spy She darts to the cover of a tree
and from there across the street Keeping to the shadows
bent low she sneaks up on the stranger’s vehicle

She hesitates one second then rises up and charges She
breaks the driver’s side window with the flashlight and
sprays directly into the face of the Mystery Man

The car door opens and the occupant tumbles out coughing and
gagging Michelle now turns on the flashlight and
illuminates Richard moaning on the asphalt of the street

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- NIGHT 48

Michelle has Richard bent over the sink as she runs water to
rinse his eyes of the pepper spray

MICHELLE
What were you thinking

RICHARD
I was worried about you What do
you think Jesus

MICHELLE
Don’t rub them

She turns off the water daubs his eyes with a rag

RICHARD
You tell me you were raped and you
didn’t go to the police Of course
I’m going to My God Jesus you
really did a number on me

MICHELLE
I’m sorry Here let me put some
of this on

She puts Vaseline on the rag starts applying it to his eyes

RICHARD
Is that gonna help Do you know
what you’re doing

MICHELLE
It’s on the pepper spray label It
says to do this in case of contact
with eyes

RICHARD
You know I’ve always had a morbid
fear of going blind

MICHELLE
Youre fine I didn’t recognize the
car Whose car is that anyway

RICHARD
(hesitant)
It’s a friend’s

MICHELLE
(stops nursing wary)
A friend’s

Even blinded Richard sees there’s no avoiding it-

RICHARD
Her name’s Héléne

MICHELLE
Héléne

RICHARD

I had to borrow her car Mine’s in
the shop Somebody dented the
bumper

MICHELLE
That dent was barely visible

That comes out somehow resounding with despair

RICHARD
She’s a friend Michelle

MICHELLE
You don’t have to spare my feelings

RICHARD
I’m not Why would I Why would I
even have to justify anything

MICHELLE
You don’t

RICHARD
Ok So I’m not

Michelle wrings out the rag

MICHELLE
Is she a student

RICHARD
A grad student

MICHELLE
I guess it was inevitable

RICHARD
She’s not my student She’s a
teaching assistant in a Virginia
Woolf seminar The Critical Studies
department a different department

MICHELLE
But she read your book didn’t she

RICHARD
Yes she has And she did tell me
how deeply it affected her and I
did melt inside OK It all went
down just like you’re picturing it

MICHELLE
It is a little amusing actually-
the way I picture it

RICHARD
This jealously is insane

MICHELLE
I’m just concerned Richard this is
what I’ve dreaded I never worried
about the ones with big tits The
ones who read Virginia Woolf will
chew you up and spit you out

RICHARD
Michelle you’re the dangerous one

He gestures to his eyes Michelle smiles despite herself

EXT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- NIGHT 49

Michelle sends a still-partially blinded Richard home in a
TAXI As soon as he’s gone she makes a bee-line for Héléne’s
car opening it via the broken window Searching it like it
was a crime scene filled with potential clues Michelle is
increasingly disheartened to find a young woman’s things
including a graded Final Exam But what really twists the
knife is when Michelle finds the girl’s bejewelled Iphone
under the seat The screen-shot is a “selfie” taken by a
pretty young woman In it Richard is nuzzling with her They
look like a real couple Unself-consciously in love

Michelle methodically puts everything back the way she found
it keeping her emotions in check as best she can

INT MICHELLE’S OFFICE -- DAY 50

Phone to her ear Michelle watches Kevin and another techie
wrestle a 7-foot-tall DEMON through the studio door

MICHELLE (INTO PHONE)
Did you know about her

INTERCUT - INT VINCENT APARTMENTMICHELLE’S OFFICE -- DAY 51

Vincent lays on the couch eating Fritos and watching TV -
with Josie in the bg moving boxes around

VINCENT (INTO PHONE)
I told you I met her

MICHELLE (INTO PHONE)
You didn’t think to mention it

VINCENT (INTO PHONE)
I dont know I
(as Josie lifts heavy box)
Dont lift that Ill move those

JOSIE

MICHELLE
Can you focus for me a second
What’s she like

VINCENT
She’s okay She teaches Yoga

Michelle turns to her computer and googles “Bikram Yoga”

Josie approches Vincent puts her hands on the ottoman

JOSIE

Take your feet off please
VINCENT

Why
JOSIE

I told Eric he could have it

MICHELE
Eric Who is this ‘Eric’

VINCENT
(to Michéle)
At the centre du Marais
(to Josie)
He doesn’t need it right this
second does he

Michelle types ‘centre du Marais’ as she does a new EMAIL
appears on her screen Mildly annoyed she clicks on it
Instantly an attachment opens like a virus an animated gif
showing a photo-shopped likeness of herself being anally
taken by the tentacled Lovecraftian creature from the video
game we glimpsed before

MICHELE
(a Vincent)
I’1l1 talk to you later

VINCENT (OFF)
(to Josie)

Where are you going now
(to Michéle)

Ok bye

But Michéle has already hung up Michelle becomes even more
disturbed as she sees the “cc” list Dozens of names

She hasn’t even finished scrolling through them when Anna
bursts in closing the door behind her

ANNA
You’ve seen it

MICHELLE
Everybody in the office got this

ANNA
I don’t know

Michelle gets up and peeks out through the blinds at the
front of her office She sees all the employees huddled
around their computers in groups of two three or more Some
cover their mouths in shock Many are laughing When they
look over at Michelle’s office and see her peering out they
react like kids who’ve been busted She closes her blinds

MICHELLE
This isn’t the first thing he’s
sent me

ANNA

Who You think this was sent by
the man who attacked you

MICHELLE
Yes

ANNA
Michelle do you think it’s
possible the person who attacked
you I mean it looks like that
email came from an internal source

MICHELLE
Maybe it did

ANNA
You have to go to the police Now
Yesterday

MICHELLE

No police I’ve had a lifetime’s
worth of police They don’t help
They do anything but help

ANNA
This is different Michelle You’re
the victim

MICHELLE
I was the victim then

ANNA
I know I’m sorry I didn’t mean

MICHELLE
I’ve worked too hard to put that
all behind me I’ve built this
life I’m not going to bring
police into it

(MORE)

MICHELLE (CONTD)
police reporters Bloggers I will
not allow this cretin to bring that
tidal wave of shit back into my
life

ANNA
But there’s a psychotic out there

MICHELLE
I have experience dealing with
psychotics I’m a pro

She smiles Anna sees Michelle’s point there

INT AV OFFICES - TECH ROOM -- DAY 52

Kevin uncomfortably watches the pornographic animation with
Michelle herself standing over him Meanwhile she
distractedly looks at her Iphone

KEVIN
It’s not necessarily an “inside
job” When our server was hacked in
June somebody ripped the Cthulu
template off our main frame So
these images are floating around
out there

MICHELLE
But that still requires my secret
admirer to be someone highly tech
savvy a former employee maybe

Kevin shrugs Michelle hmms We see what she’s distractedly
looking at on her Iphone the Bikram Yoga web site Head-
shots of the instructors The cheery face of her nemesis
Héléne Zacharian

MICHELLE (CONTD)
One more question
(shows him phone)
Do you think she’s pretty

INT A YOGA STUDIO -- DAY 53

Michelle’s immediately uncomfortable in the coat she’s
wearing It’s a “hot” yoga session Elderly bodies masses of
wrinkles covered with sweat Against that Héléne a youthful
contortionist looks like an erotic earth goddess

Michelle waits sweltering until the class has broken up abd
the old people are rolling up their mats

Then she puts on the biggest smile she can muster and crosses
the room to Héléne extending her arm for a handshake in an
aggressive way that almost seems like an attack

MICHELLE
Héléne

HELENE
Yes

Smiling uncertainly she takes Michelle’s hand

MICHELLE
I’m Richard’s ex Michelle

HELENE
Oh oh oh nice to meet you

MICHELLE
Hope it’s ok barging in on you like
this I just wanted to apologize to
you Face to face

HELENE
For what

MICHELLE
Your car window I feel terrible

HELENE
No no- please Richard explained
it to me

MICHELLE
Really What was his explanation

HELENE
(a beat confused)
It was an accident

MICHELLE
It was It was an accident
Anyway it was a great excuse to
finally meet you

Michelle gins up her bubbly friendliness again Héléne seems
to pick up on the effort making her a little uncomfortable

HELENE
No no it’s fine This is great
It’s great to finally meet you I
was thinking I was hoping
MICHELLE
At least Richard won’t have to
introduce us now We got the
awkwardness out of the way

HELENE
Was there awkwardness

MICHELLE
Well
HELENE
I mean of course I’m sure there
would be I guess there is was
MICHELLE

But we’ve survived it
Héléne smiles Another awkward beat

HELENE
We should get together some time

MICHELLE
We should In fact I’m having a
Christmas party next week You
should come You have to come

HELENE
(smiling)
If I have to

MICHELLE
I’1l call Richard and give him all
the details Anyway I should let
you get back

HELENE
Well very nice to meet you
(seeing Michelle
sweating almost faint)
Would you like some water

MICHELLE
I’m fine thanks Very nice to meet
you

Michelle gets out of there as fast as she can

INT A-V OFFICES -- DAY 54

As soon as Michelle steps off the elevator she notes the
changed atmosphere in the office Her co-workers seem to look
away quickly whenever she looks at them

INT MICHELLE’S OFFICE -- DAY 55
Michelle’s secretary sticks her head in

SECRETARY
Vincent called He was calling from
Port Royal

MICHELLE
The hospital

INT HOSPITAL -- DAY 56

Michelle anxiously moves down the corridor looking in rooms
she passes getting little glimpses of mortality

Vincent meets his mother out in the hall A nervous wreck
he’s still wearing his McDonald’s uniform A very tall dark-
skinned young man wearing a McDonald’s uniform stands by
Inside the room Josie starts screaming at a NURSE

JOSIE (OFF)
Don’t tell me what the doctor told
me bitch I know what the doctor
told me

VINCENT
She had blood in her underwear so
we came to the emergency room They
just did an ultra-sound They say
she had a a placenta

The other kid in the McDonald’s uniform speaks up-

MCDONALDS KID
Placental abruption

VINCENT
They say everything’s ok but
they’re going to induce labor
This is Omar

MICHELLE
Hello

McDonald’s kid nods back Richard arrives

VINCENT
Dad

RICHARD
No news

Vincent anxiously shakes his head Father and son embrace

INT HOSPITAL - VENDING MACHINES -- MOMENTS LATER

Michelle inserts a dollar in a coffee machine
noisily rejected

RICHARD
Suddenly we’re having a Christmas
party

MICHELLE

I thought we should meet She’s
lovely by the way

The bill is

Richard doesn’t believe this for a second Michelle finishes
smoothing out her bill inserts it again Again rejection

RICHARD
The whole thing sounds like one of
your little traps

MICHELLE
I’ve got bigger things to worry
than plotting diabolical Christmas
dinners By the way is there
anything she won’t eat Any
allergies Marty’s shedding like
crazy

Richards skeptical The machine makes its irritating SOUND
as it keeps rejecting the bill He takes out his wallet

RICHARD
I never said a word when you went
with that violinist

MICHELLE
You know the difference He was
married With three kids He had
all the requisite qualities But
her She’s a young single woman
of child-bearing age You broke the
rules

Richard puts his own bill in machine It’s accepted

RICHARD
If we had an agreement like that
you should’ve told me It’s not my
fault

MICHELLE
It is your fault We should still
be together It is your fault

RICHARD
You left me Michelle

MICHELLE
You hit me

The words chill the air between them She takes her coffee
RICHARD
If there’s one thing in my life I
could take back

Vincent finds them excited

VINCENT
It’s here

INT HOSPITAL - MATERNITY WARD -- DAY 58
Michelle Richard and Omar look at the brand new lightly
dark-skinned BABY being held up by the Nurse on the other
side of the glass Reverent silence till-
MICHELLE
There’s going to have to be a DNA
test

The others look askance at Michelle She doesn’t notice or
at least acts like she doesn’t

INT HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY 59

Vincent slips an ice cube between the pale lips of Josie who
offers a wan smile and chews

JOSIE
Are they bringing him in

VINCENT
Right now

She gets suddenly emotional Tears in her eyes

JOSIE
Everything’s going to be good for
him I’m going to be good for him

VINCENT
What are you talking about You’re
perfect

That makes her start to out and out cry The mid-wife rolls
in the baby in an incubator Josie brightens immediately

Vincent spontaneously gives his father a big hug He then
turns to Michelle and starts to hug her too but then holds
back as if remembering not to just giving her a smile
instead

Michelle watches as the baby is handed to Josie who seems a
little disconcerted as it starts crying

VINCENT (CONTD)
Guess he’s hungry

Josie looks around at everyone in the room seeming
uncharacteristically shy

VINCENT (CONTD)
Well give you a minute

Josie looks at Michelle Her expression turns resolute
defiant

JOSIE
No It’s alright

Josie bears a breast and we now see what she was abashed
about a crude and truly ugly tattoo a banner over a faded
heart with the name ‘ERIC’ Josie doesn’t avert her eyes from
Michelle silently communicating she knows it’s a legacy of
past stupidity and daring Michelle to say anything about it

EXT HOSPITAL -- NIGHT 60

Michelle smokes a cigarette by the breezeway The Nurse is
out here too Michelle trades smiles with her

MICHELLE
I had him here in this same
hospital- my son

NURSE
That’s amazing

MICHELLE
Not really But what is a little
amazing I guess is that my friend
Anna you met her

NURSE
I did

MICHELLE
She had her baby here the same
night This is where we met Her
child was still-born She asked if
she could breast-feed my baby

NURSE
Oh my

MICHELLE
I said “go ahead” I wonder about
that - they’ve always been
exceptionally close Anna and my
son I wonder if some kind of
imprinting took place Like with
ducks On the other hand myself-
sometimes I look at Vincent this
inconsequential lout I squeezed out
of my own body and realize I don’t
know him at all

Michelle notices the tall turbaned McDonald’s kid exiting
the hospital He throws Michelle a cheerful wave in passing
Michelle directs the Nurse’s attention to him with a nod

MICHELLE (CONTD)
He’s got a bounce in his step
You’re something of an expert- does
he have the air of a new father

The nurse isn’t sure what Michelle is implying so she just
smiles

MICHELLE (CONTD)
See I don’t know anything I should
know Like telling Anna “go ahead”
all those years ago - was that what a
normal woman would have done There
are just some things I never learned

INT MICHELLE’S CAR -- NIGHT 61
Almost every house on her street has its colorful Xmas lights

up now Approaching her driveway Michelle stops seeing a
PRIVATE SECURITY CAR in the middle of the street

THE SECURITY GUARD talks to Patrick and Rebecca from behind
the wheel of his car

Michelle leans out her window to see what’s going on Rebecca
comes over to her

REBECCA
Patrick should walk you inside your
house Michelle There’s a prowler
out here Patrick tussled with him

MICHELLE
A “prowler”

Patrick waves goodybe to the security guard joins the women

PATRICK
They’re going to dispatch three
patrol cars to search for this
asshole

MICHELLE
You fought with him

PATRICK
No I did not I caught him in my
bushes He was crouched down
watching your house I approached
him and he just took off

Michelle looks down the street with a weird anticipation

MICHELLE
Did you see his face

PATRICK
No I think he was wearing a mask
Like a ski mask Like a stalker on
a TV show He just took off

REBECCA
Pat you should go in with her

Patrick nods in agreement Michelle shaking her head parks
her car Patrick rejoins her as she gets out

MICHELLE
I’m sure it’s not necessary

Patrick waves dismissively No bother They head in

MICHELLE (CONTD)
I have pepper spray

PATRICK
(smiles)
Good to know

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 62
Michelle comes in cautiously turns on the light Everything

seems in order Michelle takes off her coat and waits while
he has a look around

PATRICK

Everything seems to be ok
MICHELLE

Well thank you I appreciate it
PATRICK

Please I didn’t do shit- pardon my

French

(shakes his head in
frustration looks out at
street wistful)

I almost had him He just took off
so fast In school I could doa
mile in six-fifty

Michelle smiles sympathetically at her would-be knight errant

MICHELLE
The other way to think of it is his
speed was a testament to how scared
he was of you

PATRICK
Thank you for salvaging my pride

MICHELLE
Anytime

For just a moment something passes between them as they
smile at each other A warmth maybe something more Then
Patrick goes right back to helpful neighbor mode
PATRICK
Well if you see anything hear
anything just give a holler

Michelle nods appreciatively He nods back ready to leave

MICHELLE
I’m a grandmother

She has no idea why she said that He’s slightly taken aback

PATRICK
Oh Congratulations

She shrugs as if to say “it was nothing” He smiles a little
awkwardly and withdraws Left alone Michelle mutters at
herself as she closes the door

INT A-V OFFICES -- DAY 63

Michelle’s spreading jam on toast in the office’s little
kitchen Kurt comes in wearing a black ski sweater He nods
politely to her pours himself some coffee She watches him
suspicion creeping up on her He looks up catching the way
she’s looking at him Smiles as if it pleased him

KURT
Yes

MICHELLE
I like your sweater Do you ski

KURT
I do I’1l take you some time if
you like

Michelle is taken aback no idea where he’s coming from She
betrays a bit of discomfort as he leaves her smiling

INT AV OFFICES - OUTER OFFICES - LATER 64
Michelle watches Kurt through the glass window in the studio

door Watching the way he handles a MODEL in demonic make-up
under the studio lights Watching his rough hands on her

INT AV OFFICES - TECH OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 65

MICHELLE

KEVIN
Yes

MICHELLE
The point is you own guns

KEVIN

MICHELLE
Can you teach me

INT FIRING RANGE -- DAY 66

Michelle holds a 38 in her hands like dirty harry taking
aim at a silhouette target

MICHELLE
Now I don’t pull I squeeze right
I saw that in a few different
movies

KEVIN
You just pull the trigger

Michelle pulls the trigger Hits the silhouette in the leg

MICHELLE
In a real situation that would do

KEVIN
In a real situation he’d probably
be moving faster

MICHELLE
True

KEVIN
Try the 44

Kevin hands her another gun

MICHELLE
Kevin I also wanted to talk to you
because I’ve got an off-the-books
assignment for you

KEVIN
A black op

MICHELLE
I want to find out who created the
animation in that email You know
the one I’m talking about

Kevin looking a little embarrassed nods

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
To do that I need you to hack into
the home computers of everyone in
this office All the men anyway
Well all the males

KEVIN
Michelle I want to help but
that’s a for-real major violation

MICHELLE

Trust me it’s only a metaphorical
violation

(hits target in the head)
But I do appreciate how you might
feel about it That’s why I’m
offering you ten thousand dollars
off the books This would be just
between us Our thing

Kevin likes the sound of that As she knew he would

KEVIN
You know you go through people’s
things people are going to have
some embarrassing stuff

MICHELLE
Understood My gaze is completely
non-judgemental

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- TWILIGHT 67

Michelle stands at her window Looking at Patrick wearing a
“wife beater” stringing Xmas lights around Joseph Mary and
Infant Jesus in his lawn creche She moves to another window
This angle too is obscured by a tree

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - ATTIC -- TWILIGHT 68

Michelle has binoculars to her eyes She’s curled up ina
narrow space watching Patrick at work With her free hand
she touches herself more and more vigorously As with a
barely audible whimper she finishes the Xmas lights start
to blink on below

She breathes a moment then rips open a “Handi-Wipe” and
cleans her fingers
EXT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- TWILIGHT 69

Rebecca places a ceramic sheep to the creche Patrick sees
they’ve run out of lights

PATRICK
Think we got enough illumination
here

REBECCA
(disappointed insistent)
The Infant’s head has to light up

Patrick smiles Of course As he disappears into the
backyard Rebecca looks up and sees Michelle coming toward
her Michelle musters her best friendly-neighbor smile

MICHELLE
Hey Rebecca

Rebecca shows her how a friendly neighbor smile’s done

REBECCA
Hey

MICHELLE
This is beautiful

REBECCA
I love this scene This is where it
all started

MICHELLE
It is I know this is kind of
rudely last minute but I’m having a
little Christmas get-together
tomorrow night

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- NIGHT 70

CLOSE ON Michelle’s fingers insert wooden toothpicks into
bacon-wrapped shrimp to the tune of baroque 70s glam rock

MICHELLE
It would be theoretically possible
to serve Richard’s lady love one of
these with a toothpick embedded deep
inside

Anna helping out in the kitchen smiles

ANNA
You could just poison her

MICHELLE
She’d see it coming I’m sure she’s
already got me pegged as some kind
of Medea figure

ANNA
She’s not a classics major

In the adjacent living room Richard and Robert heatedly
debate Michelle’s vinyl collection Richard shouts to the
women in the kitchen waving an LP like a battle flag

RICHARD
For Your Pleasure red vinyl Hey

There’s a loud GLEEEECH of a needle lifting as Robert
commandeers the turntable over Richard’s protest

MICHELLE
They should just take their cocks
out and measure

ANNA
The way Robert loves to relive his
youth it should worry me - we know
where that leads don’t we

Michelle smiles again but this one’s a bit tense Anna sees
Vincent coming up the walk as Josie the new baby (screaming)
in her arms goes back to close the car door Vincent enters
the kitchen carrying a homemade pie

VINCENT
I’m gonna pop this in the fridge
Josie made it It’s apple She used
a recipe but she added blueberries
to it The recipe didn’t have
blueberries she just added that

Josie carrying the screaming baby snaps at Vincent from the
living room

JOSIE
What are you thinking You left
the car door wide open

VINCENT
Well is it closed now

Josie stalks out of sight shaking her head wearily The
things she puts up with

ANNA
I swear I’m this close to calling
social services on that bitch

Follow Vincent as he tracks Josie down in the living room
Before he can apologize she shoves the baby in his arms

JOSIE
He smells horrible

Josie leaves Vincent to start rummaging through a large
diaper bag for the necessary materials The baby’s screaming
is as loud as the Iggy Pop Robert’s put on

RICHARD
Youre trying to make my grandson
deaf with that shit

IRENE (0S)
Hello all

Michelle’s mother is making her entrance like a grand dame
squired by her paramour Rafe who wears a sports jacket over
a shirt open to show off gold chains The 75-year-old wears a
short black skirt and inches of almost Baby Jane make-up

This is what greets Michelle as she enters the living room
holding a plate Anna at her side

MICHELLE
Promise you’ll kill me If I ever

Anna smiles Irene sees her daughter comes her way

MICHELLE (CONTD)
At the very first sign kill me

Michelle exchanges kisses with her mother

RAFE
Sorry were late But I wanted to
find something special This is a
decent cabernet

The DOORBELL rings As Rafe expounds on his wine selection
Michelle crosses down the entry hall to open the front door
Bob finally turns down music to watch Michelle greet Patrick
and his wife Rebecca Shes holding a trivia board game

REBECCA

Michelle embraces her warmly Patrick gives Michelle a
brotherly kiss on the cheek

PATRICK
No more excitement the last couple
of days

MICHELLE

No It seems the block’s been
fairly bogeyman free
(re a curious Robert
wandering over)
(MORE)

MICHELLE (CONTD)
Anyway were all safe tonight
Robert here has a black belt

She places a hand on Robert’s arm as she moves on leaving
Robert with Patrick and his wife

PATRICK
I just got my red belt in March I
was doing Tai Kwan Do for years but
I switched to Shokatan

ROBERT
Ive never done karate She was
making a joke

PATRICK
Oh Very funny

Robert gives a fake smile then he moves off continuing to
follow Michelle He catches up with her

ROBERT
You can’t avoid me all night

MICHELLE
I disagree

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM -- LATER 71

Michelle places a shrimp appetizer in front of empty chair
Anna and she are still putting the last plates on the table
Pleasant conversation as everybody takes their seats

JOSIE
We finally put in the new carpeting
but there’s just no end to it

Rebecca mms sympathetically Patrick comes over to Michelle

PATRICK
Thanks for having us We don’t get
out much I have to admit

The doorbell RINGS Richard is up like a shot Michelle
watches Richard pass out of sight almost apprehensively

PATRICK (CONT’D)
It’s kind of unfortunate for
Rebecca She’s a very social
person And I guess I’m not

MICHELLE
Well I’m glad she dragged you over
here tonight

PATRICK
It’s no hardship

Patrick surprises Michelle slightly by giving her wrist a
little squeeze Michelle smiles - but only briefly as she now
sees Richard returning with his arm around Héléne

HELENE
So sorry I couldn’t get here
earlier I couldn’t get off work

MICHELLE
We’re just sitting down

Michelle gives her a kiss Anna watches Michelle’s reaction
as Héléne sits down beside Richard Amid the rumble of good
cheer people dig in Rebecca smiling speaks up-

REBECCA
I’ll say grace if everybody likes

People look a little taken aback by her cheery offer Michelle
shoots a furtive sidelong glance over at Patrick and sees his
smile tighten ever-so-slightly with embarrassment

MICHELLE
Please

Rebecca Patrick and Michelle’s mother close their eyes and
folds her hands Rafe seeing Irene doing it follows suit
Everybody else slightly uncomfortably just tries to sit
there respectfully

REBECCA
Jesus Christ bless this food to
our use and us to thy service
Fill our hearts with grateful
praise Amen

IRENE
Amen
ROBERT
(too loud)
Amen

Anna gives Robert a chastising look People start eating Wine
is being passed around Michelle keeps looking over at Richard
and Héléne leaning together whispering conspiratorially

ANNA
So Patrick what do you do
PATRICK
Well I work in banking but I plead
the fifth
ANNA

Oh why’s that

PATRICK
Oh I was just joking but you
know not a very popular profession
at the moment

ROBERT
(eyes on Michelle)
Or ever really

PATRICK
Or ever

Rebecca looks mildly scandalized as Josie casually begins to
breast-feed her baby at the table Michelle raises her glass

MICHELLE
A toast to all of us and especially
the newcomers to our table Héléne
Patrick Rebecca

She looks at Rafe as if blanking on his name (playfully)

RAFE
Rafe

She nods smiling then focuses on Héléne

MICHELLE
God bless us one and all

Everyone toasts They go back to eating Héléne takes a bite
of appetizer She winces Spits something into her palm It
takes her a moment to process what she’s looking at a little
piece of wood She looks over at Michelle Wondering
Michelle does not look her way

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM -- LATER 72

Vincent paces with the baby and Anna and Michelle take dirty
plates away as Richard on a roll holds court

RICHARD
Originality singularity - they use
to be valued now they’re a
liability

Michelle leans over- confidentially - to Héléne

MICHELLE
Richard is first and foremost a
theorist

Héléne’s not sure what that means It sounds like a dig

RICHARD
And I’m not talking about novelty-
weve got novelty coming out of our
ass

ANNA
That’s a delightful image for the
dinner table

Michelle settles back down in her chair Slightly buzzed she
looks over at Patrick who sits there swirling his wine glass
looking bored A mischievous smile appears on her face

HELENE
I tell Richard- he’s so negative
He’s too young to be a curmudgeon

Under the table Michelle lets her knee graze Patrick’s He
reacts with surprise then looks away Pretending nothing
happened Vincent hands the baby back to Josie goes into the
kitchen Michelle escalates the game of “footsie” slipping
off her shoe running a foot up the length of his leg
Patrick smiles uncertainly Robert observes this looks at
Michelle sees her smiling to herself Michelle’s foot is
just at Patrick’s groin as Irene stands

IRENE
I guess this is as good a time as
any I have an announcement Cue
the drum-roll Rafe and I are
engaged to be married

Rebecca cheers Everyone else reacts with more polite
clapping Except Michelle who bursts out laughing

MICHELLE
I’m sorry excuse me but how do
you manage to be so ludicrous

Her mother’s face wrinkles up but she doesn’t answer A pall
falls over the table - broken only by Vincent returning from
the kitchen with pie

VINCENT
Hope everybody’s ok with blueberries
Josie put a ton in this They’re not
even in the official recipe

Everybody murmurs compliments making a big deal over the pie
to cover up the awkwardness Josie basks in it

JOSIE
It was an experiment

EXT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - LATER 73

Michelle smokes a cigarette out on the patio In the bg
the guests migrate from the dining table to the living room
Rebecca approaches from inside to speak to Michelle-

REBECCA
It’s almost midnight Do you mind
if I put on the mass

MICHELLE
By all means

Michelle sees Richard and Héléne coats in hand getting
ready to go She quickly puts out her cigarette

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 74
and comes back inside to see Richard and Héléne off

MICHELLE
Taking off already

HELENE
It’s my fault I have family
obligations

RICHARD
This was wonderful though
Michelle Really Next time’s our
turn You’1l come to us

MICHELLE
That’1ll be wonderful but there’s no
reason to rush it

HELENE
Let us handle it Richard We’1l1
have lunch together first Michelle
and I Just the two of us Take
things one step at a time

MICHELLE
(sincerely impressed)
I agree
RICHARD

Well great
Michelle takes Héléne’s hand To Richard-

MICHELLE
Drive safe

It sounds like “I love you” Filled with pining and regret
Richard kisses her and he and Héléne head out the door So as
not to watch them go Michelle heads to the kitchen

Robert sulking has switched to Scotch He follows her

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS 75
Robert corners Michelle out of sight of the doorway

ROBERT
Your idiotic flirting with the
banker - was that for my benefit

MICHELLE
Are you going to make a scene in my
home Robert Is this the kind of
thing I can expect now

ROBERT
(seething)
We can talk later
He turns to return to the party She stops him

MICHELLE
Hold on Your prop

She hands him a cup of coffee to take with him

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT 76

Michelle returns with more coffee Rebecca and her mother are
watching a broadcast of the Midnight Mass live from the
Vatican Chanting voices fill the room (continuously in the
background during the rest of the scene) The others are
playing the Trivia Madness Patrick sips cognac alone
Michelle sits down next to him Looks at the mass on the TV

MICHELLE
Close the book ring the bell blow
out the candle

PATRICK
What’s that

MICHELLE
What kind of Catholic are you You
never heard the rite of
excommunication

PATRICK
Have you

MICHELLE
From time to time

She smiles like a mischievous child plotting something

MICHELLE (CONTD)
My father always made the sign of
the cross on my forehead before I
went out the door to go to school
Actually he did it to all the kids
on our block Some parents finally
asked him to stop

PATRICK
I guess I can see why

MICHELLE
My father apparently took it as a
grave sleight That night he made
the rounds Door to door every
house on our block with a shotgun
a tenderizing mallet and a pair
kitchen knives

PATRICK
(uncomfortable)
I heard about that

MICHELLE
Youve heard about the twenty-seven
people You may not know about the
pets They get short shrift Six
dogs a couple of cats He spared a
hamster for some obscure reason
You can’t make this shit up

Michelle chuckles Patrick doesn’t know how to react

MICHELLE (CONTD)
I was doing my homework when he
walked back in with blood all over
him My mom was at work - she was a
nurse in those days Can you

imagine

PATRICK
We don’t have to talk about this
Michelle

MICHELLE

I don’t mind It’s cathartic
(smiles wryly at that)
When my father decided he wanted to
burn everything in the house I
helped him put things in the fire
We were pulling down drapes
tearing up carpeting Throwing it
all in It was exciting You get
caught up in a project like that
We were just starting to burn our
clothes when the police finally
moved in Somebody snapped a photo
of me I was half-naked slimed
with ash from the fire That photo
more than anything really cemented
in people’s minds that I was my
psycho father’s psycho little
helper

Patrick seems equally appalled and fascinated by Michelle’s
tale She amused by his reaction

PATRICK
Wow

MICHELLE
Yeah huh

Michelle smiling gets up and walks away leaving him to
stew in it to the sounds of the televised mass and runs
into Irene coming the other way a little wobbly

IRENE
Are you aware how brutal you were
to me at dinner

MICHELLE
Yes I am And that was just the
beginning

IRENE
You become so cruel when confronted
with something you find unpleasant
I’ve apparently become one of those
unpleasant things

MICHELLE
Neither one of us is drunk enough
yet for this conversation

Irene gives Michelle a dismissive snort and walks on Two
seconds later Michelle hears a CRASH and turns A coffee
table’s upended bottles on the floor Everyone getting up
concerned

And her mother on the floor

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
Jesus

She’s about to start yelling outrage at her mother’s latest
stunt but she sees the faces around her sees it’s for real

INT AMBULANCE -- NIGHT 77

Michelle rides in the back with her mother and a PARAMEDIC
She can’t look at her mother like this so she looks
everywhere else But then she hears her mother trying to say
something from under her oxygen mask

MICHELLE
You shouldnt try to talk Just
concentrate on breathing

Her mother insists on speaking Michelle leans in close Her
mother’s voice is hoarse very faint but clear-

IRENE
Go see him

Michelle looks chilled by the words As if this were some
kind of curse cast upon her

78 INT HOSPITAL -- DAY 78

Michelle stands anxiously in the waiting area with Vincent
Robert and Anna The DOCTOR comes out to talk to her

DOCTOR
She’s had a major stroke We
alleviated the pressure on her
brain but remains unresponsive

ANNA
Unresponsive meaning

DOCTOR
She is comatose

MICHELLE
How long

DOCTOR
There’s no telling She’s stable
right now Her blood serum is

MICHELLE
This is real

DOCTOR
(as if he didnt hear)
Excuse me

MICHELLE
There’s no way she’s faking or
playing it up or anything You’re
medically certain this is for real

The doctor looks at her a moment surprised by the question

DOCTOR
I’m sorry no I have to tell you
there’s a high likelihood your
mother will not wake up again

Michelle reels

DOCTOR (CONT’D)
But as I say she’s stable I
suggest you get some rest There’s
nothing you can do here right now

Michelle nods distantly Anna puts her arm around her The
Doctor takes his leave Robert stands there looking useless

ANNA
You should come home with us At
least for a shower

Michelle looks at her not quite able to respond

INT ANNA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM -- NIGHT 79

Robert and Anna help Michelle in Michelle is moving like a
zombie Anna looks back over her shoulder at Robert

ANNA
Would you mind sleeping in the
guest room

He decides at the last second not to protest He leaves them
alone Anna helps Michelle off with her coat

MICHELLE
Did you see Richard with Héléne

ANNA
I did Lie down

MICHELLE
(nods sits on the bed)
He was running through his little
routines And she seemed amused by

them all

ANNA
You know you’1ll wind up being good
friends

MICHELLE

Oh no doubt I’1l start going over
there for supper just the three of
us I see myself ringing a doorbell
holding a box of macaroons and I
shudder

Anna smiles She gets Michelle to lie back Michelle winds up
pulling her onto the bed with her Michelle smiles as Anna
holds her Brushes hair her out of her face They fall into
incredibly intimate silence Anna nuzzles her nose like an
eskimo

ANNA
Do you remember the time in Cassis
We tried

MICHELLE
(remembers smiling)
We couldn’t get through it without
laughing

Anna smiles They leave it at that

INT ANNA’S BEDROOM -- MORNING 80

Michelle wakes up feeling something strange It takes her a
moment to recognize that Robert’s hand is up her nightshirt
She kicks away from him

MICHELLE
What are you doing

ROBERT
Anna’s gone to the office

He says that as if it explained everything Michelle gets up

ROBERT (CONTD)
I was just trying to make you feel
better

MICHELLE
(earnestly sizing him up)
I wonder if your stupidity was what
attracted me to you in the first
place

ROBERT
I’m sorry if I misjudged

MICHELLE
Look I can’t do this anymore We
have to stop

ROBERT
Right

MICHELLE
You were a great partner and we’1l
still be friends

ROBERT
You’re serious

MICHELLE
This whole ridiculous situation was
getting too much to bear you don’t
feel that all The humiliating
absurdity of it all

ROBERT
Uh no

She strips off the nightshirt He takes this as a provocation
and tries to again put his hand down her panties She removes
his hand starts collecting her clothes He stands there
dumbstruck seeing she really means it

ROBERT (CONTD)
Your breasts have gotten bigger

MICHELLE
No I don’t think so Not that I’m
aware of

ROBERT
No doubt about it

She slips on a sweater Looks for her shoes He finds her
left one withholds it from her

ROBERT (CONTD)
Tell me you don’t want me anymore
and thatll be the end of it

MICHELLE
It’s not as simple as that but all
right I’m telling you I don’t want
this anymore this situation the
lies

ROBERT
You dodged my question

MICHELLE
Sorry I no longer want to fuck
you Was that the question

She takes her shoe He looks like a child denied a treat

INT HOSPITAL -- DAY 81

Michelle sits at her mother’s bedside eating a salad out of
a clear plastic container with a plastic fork Her mother has

tubes coming out of her everywhere

MICHELLE
I won’t see him you know I don’t
believe in the superstition of death-
bed requests If you imagine you can
manipulate me with this hideous
stunt

(MORE)

MICHELLE (CONTD)

Ever since you decided the laws of
God and Man no longer applied to you
and started acting out like a spoiled
teenager you never gave a shit what
I thought What your behavior did to
me This aneurysm thing stands out
only for its disgusting treachery
This salad is awful They just dumped
in a can of olives

(stares out window)
You can’t stay mad at me you know

Michelle notices that the TV suspended from the wall is on
the fritz She drags her chair over to stand on it while she
tries to adjust it

MICHELLE (CONTD)
Of course BFM-TV is the one
station that comes in

She keeps switching back and forth through channels She
registers only vaguely at first the whole TEAM of doctors
and nurses rushing into the room and gathering around her
mother’s bed When she sees them she fills with fear

MICHELLE (CONTD)
What’s going on

They don’t answer Too busy swarming around Irene taking
urgent measurements Michelle is terrified now

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
I thought I heard a different beep
Was that the sound

Her voice comes out weak a little girl’s squeak They don’t
hear her Finally one of the nurses sees her

NURSE
Miss you have to go outside

The Nurse gently but firmly pushes her toward the door
Helpless lost Michelle finds herself standing out in the
hall looking in

EXT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- TWILIGHT 82

Michelle gets out of car sluggish like a sleepwalker She
stops as she sees the LIGHT is on in her upstairs bedroom

The curtains there billow spookily

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 83

Michelle comes in warily Marty the cat leaps into her arms
She takes him with her as she heads upstairs

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS 84

Michelle enters cautiously She discovers the covers have
been ripped off her bed and a NOTE - written in red lipstick -
left atop the crumpled sheets

She reads sorry I couldn’t wait

She then notices the cum sprayed all over the violet colored
sheet Michelle sets Marty down and starts stripping the
bedding like it was just another chore

EXT COUNTRYSIDE -- DAY 85

Dressed as if for a cocktail party Michelle leads a somewhat
clumsy parade up a steep grassy hill Richard Anna Robert
Vincent Josie and Rafe are all respectfully attired too
though Rafe looks like he was hanging out poolside Vincent
carries a cardboard box that looks like it might contain
Chinese takeout The babys screaming in Josies arms

MICHELLE
Im looking for a spot that might
have some significance But its
not like theres going to be a sign
that says dispose of mother
here

RICHARD
We had a picnic over there once-
that hollow over there

MICHELLE
I remember Her chicken salad gave
me horrific gas I dont want to
immortalize that

Behind them an eruption The new mother is suddenly crying
loudly carrying on- and obviously not for Michelle’s mother

JOSIE
Just leave me alone You can’t
fucking fix everything

VINCENT
Josie

JOSIE
Leave me alone

She storms off with the baby down the hill Everyone looks
mortified Vincent plays it off like a big joke

VINCENT

She wanted to say something About
grandma But then she realized she
didn’t really have anything to say
and she got upset over that and
then Its post-partum you
know I just hope my boy doesnt
take after her in the temperament
department

MICHELLE
Vincent hes a lovely child but
hes not your boy Dont lose sight
of that

Vincent doesn’t really hear her He holds up a pacifier

VINCENT
Here it is After all that

MICHELLE
Did you hear me Vincent

VINCENT
Yeah sure but what

MICHELLE
The boy is not really yours
Vincent That’s what I’m telling
you Look at him His skin is two
tones darker than you or Josie’s
You must see that

VINCENT
(getting angry now)
Whose is he if he’s not mine

MICHELLE
He’s his father’s I guess And
youre not his father Vincent I’m
sorry but you’re being made a fool
of

Vincent raises his hand as if he were going to hit Michelle
She waits for it Almost daring him to hit her He wavers as
Anna comes into the room to see what’s up

ANNA
Vincent

He looks at his mother stammering unable to find words

VINCENT
I just You’re a cunt

Fighting tears Vincent hands Michelle the box and stalks
off Anna shoots Michelle a more confused than accusing look
and goes off after him down the hill Michelle looks around

MICHELLE
This is as good as anywhere I
guess The winds blowing out

Richard shrugs Michelle opens the box and dumps the ashes
Which land largely in a clump at her feet Looks like thats
it She reluctantly accepts a clasp of hands from Rafe

EXT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- NIGHT 86

A wind gathers strength Tree branches sway Xmas lights slip
loose of their moorings Michelles house is dark only one
light on the second floor A loose shutter up there creaks
loudly back and forth

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- NIGHT 87
The CREAKING can be heard in Michelle’s bedroom as she
wearing a night-shirt examining storyboards A zombie
soldier extends a tentacle-like arm toward the viewer The

caption “It’s just you and me now”

Michelle jumps as the steady creaking becomes a BANG - the
wind slamming the shutter against the side of the house

At the same time The doorbell RINGS downstairs Michelle
finds this curious
INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - ENTRYWAY -- NIGHT 88

Michelle opens the door in her knee-length night shirt and
finds Patrick on her stoop

PATRICK
I didn’t want to disturb you but I
just got home and saw all your
shutters are open The weather’s
turning fast Half your windows are
gonna get blown out

MICHELLE
That wouldn’t be good

PATRICK
I know it probably sounds like I’m
being chicken little or something
but itll amaze you what the winds
can do up here

MICHELLE
No I’ve seen it You should’ve
been here in ‘99 It was like the
end of the world

PATRICK
I believe it You’re probably going
to need a hand

MICHELLE
Yes probably Thank you

Michelle lets him in Shuts the door behind him

PATRICK
Your mother’s funeral was today

MICHELLE
There was no service We just

She trails off He nods

PATRICK
I’m very sorry Michelle

She nods thanks He’s already at the first window brimming
with authority pulling it open and grabbing the shudder
pinned against the outside wall He now engages in a battle
with the elements to pull the window closed Dead leaves
start to blow in Michelle gives a hand An icy wind whipping
them Patrick handles the window while she reaches out and
pull in the shutter Finally it slams shut

Michelle smiles shivers a residual shiver from the cold He
reaches out and rubs her arms through the thin flannel of her
pajamas The innocent gesture takes her aback slightly

MICHELLE
I never counted but I think there’s
something like twenty windows in
this house

PATRICK
The wind’s from the west We’1l do
that side

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLBEDROOM 89

Michelle follows Patrick down the hall He stops in the
doorway of her bedroom He gives her a questioning look She
nods- go ahead The bed is a unmade Her underwear is slung
over a chair

MICHELLE
I wasn’t expecting anyone

He smiles He pauses seeing one of Michelle’s storyboards on
the bed It’s a stylized vintage airplane in flames

PATRICK
That looks like a ‘43 Grumman
Wildcat

MICHELLE

I wouldn’t know

PATRICK

I’ve always thought about
rebuilding a vintage aircraft like
that Taking it to Paris

MICHELLE
You fly

PATRICK
No But you got to have a dream
right

They share a little laugh They’re very close only inches
between them the window starts MOANING and CRACKLING in the
wind breaking the spell of the moment

They go into their routine again These shutters are more
difficult When the shutter finally comes free of the wall
it closes so forcefully they both stumble backward onto the
bed beside each other They lie there like that a moment An
electric current passes between them but Patrick
remaining in helpful neighbor mode gets up and goes to
secure the shutter

PATRICK (CONT’D)
Almost done

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - ATTIC -- NIGHT 90

Michelle leads Patrick up the narrow staircase in forced
proximity She flips the light switch The bulb BLOWS OUT

MICHELLE
Shit

They go in anyway They have to maneuver in near total
darkness through the low-ceilinged space The wood beams
creak like the end of the world Patrick pull the window open
- the one she watched him through - and starts wrestling with
a shutter It gets away from him Michelle ducks under
Patrick’s outstretched arms to lend a hand Now his arms are
around her Leaning way out the window in freezing wind she
rubs her butt against him Patrick stays focused on his
mission She practically rolls her eyes in frustration What
is it going to take

When they get the shutter closed finally they stay there a
moment still His arms stay around her She waits His hand
lowers her panties slowly exposing her bottom She feels
what his moving hand is doing She moans in pleasure
spreading her legs and bracing herself against a beam

She twists her head around for a kiss but Patrick leaps
backward pulling away from her

PATRICK
I’m sorry

Patrick hurries away leaving her there She hears his
FOOTSTEPS pounding down the stairs She stands there a
moment feeling shame and more than that frustration

MICHELLE
Idiot

She hits a wooden beam with the flat of her hand

INT AV OFFICES -- DAY 91

Michelle moves through the office like a locomotive of
restless energy She sees Kurt makes a detour to him

MICHELLE
The “Summoning” cut-scene needs to
come later
(cutting him off)
(MORE )

MICHELLE (CONTD)
We don’t have time to argue The
player needs to encounter Kira in her
repressed schoolteacher persona
before her Dark Rebirth otherwise
there’s nothing titillating about her
transformation

Kurt clearly wants to debate but Michelle moves on She’s
waved over by Kevin in the doorway of the “Tech” room which

is watched over by an imposing rubber ROBOT SENTRY

KEVIN
Got a minute

INT AV OFFICES - TECH ROOM -- DAY
Michelle sits beside Kevin at his computer

KEVIN
I found this on Kurt’s private
server It looks like he’s into
crushing

MICHELLE
What’s “crushing”

KEVIN
What it sounds like As you see

MICHELLE
(reading off screen)
“Sammantha gardens”

A video plays an overly made-up woman wielding a watering
can in an evening gown keeps “accidentally” stepping on bugs

wrangled at her feet

MICHELLE (CONTD)
It’s disturbing Not exactly a
smoking gun though

KEVIN
I guess not

Michelle looks at Kevin She’s struck by something Something

in the way he looks at her

MICHELLE
Good work Keep on it

INT ANNA’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 93
Anna looks up Michelle enters moving swiftly

MICHELLE
Id like a consultation

Michelle goes straight to Anna’s Mac calls up that
pornographic animation Anna looks confused by this

MICHELLE (CONTD)
The creature sodomizing me
doesn’t he look like Kevin a
little

She brings up an employee portrait of Kevin for comparison

ANNA
A little around the eyes Yes

Michelle nods feeling a surge of vindication

INT MICHELLE’S OFFICE -- NIGHT 94

Most of the lights in the suite are off Michelle sits at her
desk antsy fiddling with an e-cigarette as she watches a
MAINTENANCE GUY empty a trash can When he moves off the
last lights go out

INT AV OFFICES - TECH ROOM -- CONTINUOUS 95

Michelle leaves the lights off as she crosses directly to
Kevin’s work station She moves collectible action figurines
out of the way so she can access his keyboard She pushes a
master power button and immediately a LOUD HUM comes out of
his speakers

She quickly turns the volume down Looks around to make sure
no one’s been drawn by the sound She hears nothing

The laptop takes forever to boot up When it finally does
Michelle enters a password Another screen comes up She
clicks on a list of files Scanning them one name
immediately jumps out at her Ashgirlmvk

Michelle hesitates almost fearfully before she clicks on it

The news photo of her as a child is the first that comes up
but there others some we saw in that TV broadcast There are
several photos of her father too One where he’s posed with a
gun Another click and she sees the original sketch version
of that animation of her being raped by the creature

The LIGHTS COME ON Michelle starts like a cat burglar caught
in the act It’s Kevin in the door

KEVIN
Oh I didn’t know it was you

She holds her breath as he comes toward her He sees what
she’s looking at

KEVIN (CONTD)
You’re probably mad

MICHELLE
At this moment I’m mostly curious

KEVIN
I guess I have to tell you

MICHELLE
Yes you do

KEVIN
I was never going to show it to
anyone Phillip Kwan ripped the
animation off my computer
converted it to an MVK and sent it
to everyone in the office

MICHELLE
But you created it

KEVIN
Yes

MICHELLE
Why

KEVIN

(devastated)
Personal amusement It started
out as an idea for a game that
incorporated true crime footage
then it got weird But nobody would
have seen it if it wasn’t for
fucking Phillip Kwan- who deserves
to be fired if I’m getting fired

Michelle looks at Kevin Sizing him up

MICHELLE
Take out your penis

He thinks she’s joking

MICHELLE (CONTD)
Show me your penis and I might nor
fire you

He’s abashed but he sees no choice He unzips Displays

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
I thought you were Jewish

KEVIN
Well no

MICHELLE
Put it away The man I’m looking
for doesn’t have a foreskin

Kevin is confused but happily puts his penis away

KEVIN
Am I fired

MICHELLE
I want every bit of this destroyed
and youre going to sign a non-
disclosure agreement that I’11
draft for you Then we’ll see

EXT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- TWILIGHT 96

Michelle gets out of her car She’s surprised to see a
PACKAGE on her porch She approaches it as if it were
something ominous but shows relief as she looks at the label

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- NIGHT 97

Michelle uses scissors to open the package She pulls out an
INFANT CAR SEAT Rests it on the table Looks at it with a
certain melancholy thinking of Vincent and his baby

She suddenly becomes aware she’s not alone

She’s just turning around when a GLOVED HAND closes over her
mouth The Intruder wearing the same ski mask throws her to
the ground On her way down she tips the table sending all
kinds of things clattering The scissors fall open on the
floor The lamp winds up on its side casting a weird
noirish light over the struggle now taking place

Michelle tries to twist around to see her attacker He hits
her right in the jaw climbs on top of her He tears her
blouse her bra She screams to raise the dead

He’s working on getting his pants down as Michelle’s
desperately reaching hand brings a bookcase down on both of
them

The Intruder gets the worst of it Michelle scrambles free
but she doesn’t get far He grabs her ankle reels her in He
lifts her skirt Tears her panties Michelle kicks at him
blindly He starts slapping her hard about the face as if
punishing her for making this hard for him

Michelle’s hand closes around the open scissors She brings
them up just as the Intruder’s hand is coming down The hand
abruptly stops in mid-air - pierced clean through by one of
the scissors’ blades Now it’s his turn to scream

Michelle seizes the moment to grip her attacker’s mask by the
eyeholes and yank it off his face

Patrick’s eyes are filled with tears of pain Michelle raises
up on her haunches levelling the bloodied scissors at him

MICHELLE
Get out of my house

Patrick backs away in panic holding his injured hand

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
Out Get out

Patrick looks for just a second as if he wanted to say
something Instead he just bolts for the door Quaking
Michelle takes a moment to compose herself

She moves to the window just in time to witness Patrick
running back across the icy street toward his house slipping
and taking a nasty fall Michelle feels an absurd momentary
reflex to go see if he’s okay

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - LATER 98

Michelle walks through the room cleaning up the debris of
the struggle Her legs suddenly seem to go wobbly and she
sinks to the floor She sits there

EXT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- MORNING 99

Michelle comes out to retrieve her newspaper from the
driveway She stops seeing Patrick like any suburban
neighbor comes out of his house with a thermos of coffee
She notes his bandaged hand He sees her

They briefly exchange looks but there is otherwise no
acknowledgement of what’s passed between them as he gets in
his car and drives away

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- NIGHT 100

The light of a TV flickers in the den Michelle blankly
watches the news still in her party dress

Michelle blankly watches the news still in her party dress
Michelle sits up a little straighter as a still photo of her
father appears behind the TV Anchor’s shoulder

TV ANCHOR
Parole was again denied for mass
murderer George Leblanc

MICHELLE
Fuck you

Michelle mutes the sound The image cuts to a close-up of her
father sitting sullenly alone at his parole hearing

MICHELLE (CONTD)
(trying different
intonations)
Fuck you Fuck you Fuck you

She turns off the TV Gets up moves to window Looks across
at Patrick’s house The light of a TV flickers there too

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - STUDY - MOMENTS LATER 101

Michelle is on the phone Her laptop open to the website of
the GRATERFORD STATE PENITENTIARY

MICHELLE (INTO PHONE)
Your website mentions visitors
allowing two hours for admittance
is it better late in the day

PRISON OFFICIAL
No ma’am All visitors for the day
have to check in by 830 AM

MICHELLE
So it’s a mob scene

PRISON OFFICIAL
It gets pretty crowded

MICHELLE
Are there any days of the week that
are better than others

EXT PRISON -- DAY 102

It’s snowing as Michelle drives up to the GRATERFORD STATE
PENITENTIARY Leftover Xmas decoration on the gate look odd
against this grim institutional backdrop

INT PRISON -- DAY 103

More odd bits of Xmas kitsch “liven up” the visitor-
processing area too Michelle signs in Before she even finds
an empty orange plastic chair to sit in a very solicitous
Asst Warden comes out to meet her

ASST WARDEN
Miss Leblanc I’m Brent Jaffries
the assistant Warden Can I get you
anything A cup of coffee

MICHELLE
No Thank you

ASST WARDEN
We can talk in my office if you
don’t mind It’s just here

He gestures the way Michelle nods follows

MICHELLE
You should know I’m here just to
spit in my father’s face And I
can’t promise I’m only speaking
metaphorically

ASST WARDEN
People have all kinds of reasons

MICHELLE
I’m here because I’ve given that
bastard too much power over me
Shunning him fearing him All that
wasted energy

ASST WARDEN
Miss Leblanc your father is dead

Michelle stops walking She can’t believe it

ASST WARDEN (CONT’D)
Shortly before eight AM this
morning your father was found
deceased in his cell

MICHELLE
How

ASST WARDEN
The incident is in the earliest
stages of being investigated but it
seems he was able to fashion a
noose from his bedding and hanged
himself

MICHELLE
When When did this happen

ASST WARDEN
We only know it must have been
between 10 PM and the early morning
hours

MICHELLE
Do you happen to know what time my
father was notified that I was
coming to see him

ASST WARDEN
(hesitant)
That would have been just before ten

Michelle nods again slowly

104 INT PRISON - MORGUE -- DAY 104

Michelle is led through a chilly storage room by the Asst
Warden and an ATTENDENT in blue surgical cover-alls

ASST WARDEN
Your mother made arrangements for
your father to be cremated and
installed in a vault next to one
she’d selected for herself

MICHELLE
She’s not there She’s on my
kitchen counter

The Asst Warden has no response They arrive at a gurney
with a human-shaped lump under a sheet

MICHELLE (CONTD)
I had a list of things I was going
to say Nine bullet points

The Attendant looks to her She nods she’s ready He pulls
back the sheet Her father looks like a peaceful old man
except for the lurid laceration around his throat She
studies him

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
He’d rather die than face me I
killed him by coming here

INT PRISON - MORGUE -- MOMENTS LATER 105

Michelle stands in the same place as the Attendant ferries
the coffin away on a forklift She signs a form the Asst
Warden hands her on a clipboard The forklift has trouble
making a turn The cavernous space is filled with the BEEP-
BEEP-BEEP of the lift backing up

EXT ROAD -- DAY 106

Driving back home in a blizzard Michelle fiddles with the
radio Michelle’s phone RINGS She doesn’t recognize the
number displayed on the dash She answers hands-free

MICHELLE
Yes

Michelle immediately regrets answering

MICHELLE
Who is this

REPORTER (0S)
My name’s Emilie Fontaine I’m with
the Parisien I just wanted to ask
if you had anything you wanted to
say about your father’s passing

MICHELLE
How did you get this number

REPORTER (0S)
I realize this is an awkward time
but I just wanted to give you the
opportunity to go on record with
your thoughts feelings

MICHELLE
My thoughts and feelings

Michelle is distracted as obscured by falling snow a DEER
darts across the highway She cranks the wheel The car goes
into a SKID

EXT ROAD -- DAY 107

Michelle’s car CRASHES into a ditch Winds up on its side

INT CAR -- DAY 108

Michelle sits stock-still in shock held into her seat
against gravity by her seat belt She only distantly
registers that the reporter on the phone is still talking

REPORTER (0S)
Anger grief relief perhaps

Michelle presses a button on the steering wheel to hang up
She reaches over with a trembling hand and turns off the
radio She’s distantly alarmed to see blood She investigates
and sees her leg is banged up pretty nicely by the buckled
dashboard She shakily presses a number on her phone

ANNA (0S)
This is Anna Please leave a

Voice-mail Michelle hangs up She scrolls down to the next
name on her phone’s contacts list Richard It rings Rings
some more She hangs up Looking around something catches
her eye A yellow scrap of paper in the well of the passenger
seat The flyer regarding the new trash can policy on her
block She painfully stretches to pick it up

There’s a black shoe-print on the flyer but Patrick’s phone
number is still legible

EXT ROAD -- LATER 109

Rebecca’s car a Honda Station wagon with a “St Jude Pray and
Protect Us” bumper sticker pulls up next to the wreck
Dutiful neighbor Patrick gets out bundled up and goes to
the frosted driver’s side window Michelle rolls it down

PATRICK
How are you feeling

MICHELLE
How am I feeling

PATRICK
Any symptoms Dizziness
MICHELLE
(realizing what he meant)
Oh no I’m fine I think Except
my leg

Patrick leans in evaluates the situation He reaches in She
tenses a little as he puts his arm around her shoulder

PATRICK
You can take off the seat belt now

She does He holds her Starts to laboriously lift her out
the window ginger with his bandaged hand

110 INT PATRICK’S CAR -- TWILIGHT 110
Michelle’s in the passenger seat Awkward silence until-

PATRICK
You should probably go to the ER

MICHELLE

I’1l see my own doctor

PATRICK
It’s your call

111 EXT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- NIGHT 111

112 INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- NIGHT 112

Patrick helps her onto the sofa

PATRICK
You should let me look at it

She just looks at him

PATRICK (CONT’D)
I played soccer in high school

MICHELLE
That’s the least surprising thing
I’ve ever heard

PATRICK
I mean I know a bit about leg
injuries Senior year I tore up my
ACL Spent a year with Orthopedic
surgeons

Michelle assents with a little nod Patrick bends down to
look at her leg He lifts her skirt It sticks in places
where blood has dried but he’s gentle

PATRICK (CONT’D)
We better clean this pronto

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - DEN -- MOMENTS LATER 113

Patrick tend to her bare injured leg Gently swabbing her
lacerations with disinfectant

PATRICK
Looks to me like maybe a hairline
fracture You need real treatment

He starts wrapping her leg with an ace bandage Michelle
studies him She leans forward He looks up

MICHELLE
Why did you do it

PATRICK
It was necessary

He says this matter-of-factly and finishes with the bandage
all business He then takes his leave without another word

EXT MICHELLE’S MOTHER’S APARTMENT -- DAY 114

Fresh snow everywhere Limping on a temporary cane wearing a
bulky knee brace and carrying an empty cardboard box
Michelle tackles the steep front steps

INT MICHELLE’S MOTHER’S APARTMENT -- DAY 115

Michelle limps in Not wanting to spend a second longer here
than she has to Michelle goes straight to a particular
cabinet She puts the box on the floor and starts putting
things in it mostly old pictures

Rafe comes out of the back hair mussed wearing boxer shorts
and an inside-out white T-shirt Shaking his head upset

RAFE
Oh no Michelle You can’t do this

MICHELLE
What can’t I do

RAFE
This Just showing up letting
yourself in without ringing the bell

MICHELLE
You know I have a key Rafe Why
would I need to ring the bell You
don’t have to trouble yourself I’m
only here a minute

RAFE
It’s not about how long you stay
Michelle

MICHELLE

Don’t be unpleasant

RAFE
No - I’m sorry no You have to go
right now

MICHELLE
You realize I own this place right

RAFE
That may be but your mother invited
me to stay here and while I’m here

A completely naked BRUNETTE in her thirties emerges from
behind Rafe Rafe looks like a busted teenager Michelle
smiles He gestures to the woman to go back where she was

MICHELLE
Anyway I’m selling it That’s what
I’m doing here

Michelle reaches into her purse and produces a “FOR SALE”
sticker Rafe seethes impotently as Michelle hobbles over to
the window looking out onto the street

RAFE
I saw on the news your father died
One less evil fucker in the world

Michelle carefully affixes the sticker to the window

MICHELLE
You should start packing your bags

Rafe snorts Michelle collects her box from the floor- a
difficult procedure juggling the cane at the same time

RAFE
I’ve seen all the shows on TV
About you and your dad when you
killed all those people

When she drops one of the photos Rafe laughs so she can hear
it Michelle ignores him retrieves the photo with as much
dignity as she can

RAFE (CONTD)
I’ve seen all the old news photos
All the bodies

OR PERHAPS
I saw all these dead bodies also
children

Michelle has trouble with the door knob juggling the cane
and the box tucked under her arm

RAFE
Anyway the sick bastards dead
now At least I fucked his wife

Michelle makes it out the door without looking back

EXT MICHELLE’S MOTHER’S APARTMENT -- DAY 116

The steps are even more difficult coming down Michelle’s
phone RINGS She stops juggles the box in order to answer

ROBERT (0S)
Anna’s just got called away by the
London thing and I have a free
afternoon

MICHELLE (INTO PHONE)
We said Wednesday

ROBERT (0S)

But this is better I can get a
room at the Lanai They’ve got the

MICHELLE (INTO PHONE)
Robert I was going to call - I
fractured my knee My legs ina

ROBERT (0S)
What difference does it make you

His implacable logic leaves her speechless

INT HOTEL ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 117

They’re pounding away on the bed Or rather he is Michelle
lies beneath him in her braced leg as silent and still as a
corpse Deliberately ostentatiously frozen Robert flips her
over with some clumsiness - her body responding to his
ministrations exactly like a lifeless dummy

INT HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM -- LATER 118

Michelle scrubs with scented body wash as Robert also nude
combs his hair and admires himself in the mirror

ROBERT
You were incredible

Michelle looks at him Is he joking

ROBERT (CONTD)
I experienced some sensations I
never felt before Where’d you get
the idea of playing dead

Michelle starts getting dressed

MICHELLE
Anyway you see I’m good as my
word You got what you wanted

ROBERT
I sure did thank you

MICHELLE
So we can remain friends

He nods smiling Michelle heads out buttoning her blouse
At the door she feels it’s prudent to stop and turn back

MICHELLE (CONTD)
And “friends” means we’re not
fucking anymore

He nods That’s clear Now she can continue out

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- DAY 119

Michelle enters with the cardboard box of her mother’s
things She immediately senses something’s askew

MICHELLE
Marty

She puts down the box and hobbles around looking for him

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
Marty

She sees the pantry door ajar

EXT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- DAY 120

Looking for Marty outside Michelle soon finds him Frozen to
death Looking like a Snow-Cat molded by a child’s mittens

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- DAY 121

Michelle brushes ice crystals out of the dead cat’s fur in
front of her fireplace until the futility of her actions
can’t be denied anymore

EXT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- TWILIGHT 122

Bundled up Michelle sits on her porch holding the dead cat
wrapped in a cloth She stares at the Xmas tree standing
among the garbage cans across the street AN ANIMAL CONTROL
OFFICER pulls up in a van She reluctantly hands him over

ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICER
Sorry for your loss

He starts to leave
MICHELLE

Arent there aren’t there any
forms to fill out

ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICER
No ma’am

Michelle looks quietly devastated by that answer as the man
departs with Marty’s body

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- TWILIGHT 123

Michelle wearily heads upstairs As she passes the guest
bedroom she does a double-take There’s a MALE FORM fully
clothed lying on top of the covers It takes her a moment to
realize who it is

MICHELLE
Vincent

The young man wakes groggily

VINCENT
Mom hey

MICHELLE
What are you doing How long have
you been here

VINCENT
Huh Um a while I guess Josie
kicked me out

MICHELLE
(with mixed feelings)
What happened

VINCENT
I don’t know

MICHELLE
You must know She must have had a
reason however demented

VINCENT
She had a reason I lost my job

MICHELLE
Lost

VINCENT
I resigned

MICHELLE
You resigned

VINCENT
I had to My car broke down

MICHELLE
You resigned from McDonald’s
because your car broke down

A sound startles and chills Michelle A BABY’S CRYING

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
You brought the baby here

Michelle now discovers the baby hidden behind pillows placed
to keep him from rolling off the bed

VINCENT
I had to

MICHELLE
Why did you have to

Vincent picks up the baby

VINCENT
She was talking about going back to
America and taking Lucien with her
I could tell she meant it

Michelle shakes her head taking it all in as Vincent
clumsily shoves a bottle in the baby’s mouth

MICHELLE
I can’t believe I’m saying this but
can’t you see Josie had a right to
be angry You have responsibilities-
including a new apartment - and you
quit your job

VINCENT
You say it just like her Like it
was just despicable It was maybe
stupid but it wasn’t despicable

Michelle looks struck by that She softens

MICHELLE
Vincent you have to take him back
right now You’re not married This
could be considered kidnapping

VINCENT
Kidnapping He’s my son
(off her look)
HE’S MY SON

MICHELLE
Alright

VINCENT
Not “alright”

There’s a FURIOUS KNOCKING downstairs

MICHELLE
(sarcastically)
Who could that be

She turns and heads down the stairs She opens the front door
and Josie bursts in moving right past Michelle

JOSIE
Where is he

Vincent appears on the stairs Michelle watches anxiously as
Josie goes up the stairs toward him tearing into him

JOSIE (CONTD)
Where’s my baby
(not giving him a chance
to answer)
Where’s my baby Is he alright
What did you do to him

VINCENT
(confused)
What did I do to her

JOSIE
I wouldn’t trust you to take care
of a hamster Fucking idiot
Where’s my baby Give him to me
right fucking now Now

The baby’s cry alerts her to his location She passes Vincent
on the stairs He grabs her wrist Josie wheels on him

JOSIE (CONT’D)
Get your hand off me Get your hand
off me Get your hand off me

MICHELLE
Vincent Let her go

He doesnt immediately A moment of unbearable suspense
Vincent looks ready to hit her before he finally does let
her go She charges upstairs He starts to go after her

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
Let her go

Vincent looks at his mother like a helpless child The baby’s
CRYING stops A moment later Josie reappears coming down
the stairs bouncing the baby in her arms

VINCENT
Josie

MICHELLE
Vincent be quiet

Josie walks right past him to the front door She stops

JOSIE
I had to take the RER here

Vincent starts plumbing his pockets He’s not finding any
change Michelle crosses to her purse takes out a twenty
She brings it to Josie who glares at Vincent one last time
and exits Vincent’s eyes fill with tears He tries to hide
it Michelle goes to him Looking at him something occurs to
her

MICHELLE
It was always about the baby
wasn’t it He’s what you were in it
for

Vincent looks up like his guilty secret had been found out

VINCENT
I could be a good father I know it

Michelle touches his arm tentative but tender

MICHELLE
I’1l make mostaccioli for dinner

INT NATURALIA -- EVENING 124
Michelle browses Vincent approaches with a bag of chips

MICHELLE
Those are so full of salt

Vincent looks disappointed goes to put them back Michelle
pushes the cart around a corner Just as she’s selecting a
tomato sauce she hears Vincent talking to someone in the
aisle just vacated She backs up to look It’s Patrick
Vincent’s talking with him like they were old friends
Seeing Michelle Patrick’s smile tenses up a little

PATRICK
Michelle hey How’s your knee

MICHELLE
How’s your hand

He glances self-consciously at the bandage on his hand More
uncomfortable now He shrugs not knowing what to say

VINCENT
We were just talking about whether
it matters if a chocolate chip
cookie comes from Lithuania I say
it does

PATRICK
I’m skeptical I guess

MICHELLE
I’m withholding judgement

Michelle moves down the aisle stopping right in front of
Patrick He wonders what she’s going to say She reaches past
him to take down a can of sauce This makes him smile
Feeling more confident now-

PATRICK

Vincent says you guys havent
eaten Rebecca took off on a road
trip with her parents and left me
with like a metric ton of Lasagna
Ill never eat by myself

(gestures with wine)
I was getting this to go with it

VINCENT
Sounds good to me

Michelle looks at Vincent back at Patrick She smiles Sure

INT PATRICK’S HOUSE -- NIGHT 125

Michelle Patrick and Vincent sit around a table eating
pasta The wine is flowing

MICHELLE
Where did Rebecca and her parents
go

PATRICK

They went to see the Pope in
Santiago de Compostella They’re
driving Insane if you ask me

MICHELLE
The Le Quesnoy Family

VINCENT
The Pope’s going to give mass at
the cathedral I have a hard time
imagining him barefoot It’s so
weird to think he’s like a real
person with feet

Patrick and Michelle both chuckle Vincent grins big the
wine already having an effect He reaches for the bottle

MICHELLE
Careful there sport

Vincent gives an “aw mom” look fills his glass

INT PATRICKS HOUSE - DEN -- LATER 126

Patrick smiles sits down Michelle takes off her shoes He
watches her flex her bare feet

MICHELLE (CONTD)
The floor’s warm

PATRICK
It’s a wood boiler I installed it
myself

MICHELLE

Sounds like a job

PATRICK
It was It holds fifty liters
Works by inverted flame combustion

MICHELLE
Inverted flame combustion That
sounds like a made-up thing

PATRICK
Finally something you don’t know

She grins He watches her She sees the way he’s watching
Finally as if it were some wild gambit he adds-

PATRICK (CONTD)
It’s in the basement

MICHELLE
Of course it is

PATRICK
Would you like to see it

A challenge A dare

MICHELLE
Yes

INT PATRICK’S HOUSE - HALL -- MOMENTS LATER 127

Michelle follows Patrick to the basement doorway He opens
it stands aside for her to down first She hesitates The
wood boiler ROARS down there The steps leading down are lit
only by the flicker of its hellish firelight Michelle looks
at him and takes the first step down

INT PATRICK’S HOUSE - BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS 128
Michelle separates from and Patrick as they reach the bottom

PATRICK
It’s loud but you can’t hear
anything with the door closed

She nods understanding all the implications of that She
stares inti the flames beyond the furnace’s grate

MICHELLE
(to herself)
It’s just you and me now

PATRICK
What

She shakes her head Turns to him He grabs her wrist

MICHELLE
No

He doesn’t listen He shoves her against the wall hard
sticking his knee between her legs She backs him off with a
pelvic thrust

MICHELLE (CONTD)
Vincent’s upstairs

PATRICK
Yes Vincent’s upstairs

Patrick grabs her again by the hair She yowls He shoves
her to the floor toppling a laundry basket She slaps at him
frantically as he climbs on top of her She squirms and
punches but he holds her down rubbing himself against her
Suddenly Michelle stops fighting Plays dead Patrick now
inexplicably stops too He climbs off her looking by turns
frustrated embarrassed pouty Michelle look at him

PATRICK (CONTD)
It doesn’t work like that For me
It has to be like before

She just looks at him Patrick gets up to leave But before
he makes it to the stairs Michelle suddenly attacks him
Pummeling him as if spending all her frustration and rage on
him He turns around She whacks him across the face Now
it’s on again He shoves her down banging the back of her
head on the floor As she continues to viciously futilely
fight back he tears her bra and panties in the manner he’s
done before and slips inside her

It’s over pretty quickly He rolls off panting Satisfied

Michelle’s whole body convulses Impossible to tell if its
pleasure or sickness A scream builds inside her then
explodes She screams and screams Harrowing howls of pain
and primal release The screams freak out Patrick a little
When the screams subsides they turn into simple purging
tears Patrick looks around uncomfortably He reaches out to
comfort her but his hand stops halfway there and retreats

INT PATRICK’S HOUSE - DEN - A SHORT TIME LATER 129
Michelle lays a gentle hand on Vincent’s shoulder waking
him Michelle helps the groggy young man up Patrick pitches
in too

EXT PATRICK’S HOUSE -- NIGHT 130

the street Patrick watches them the whole way

INT A-V OFFICES -- DAY 131

On screen a winged vampiric female creature emerges from a
black chrysalis screaming The clip ends Lights come on

A small group gathered in front of the monitor applauds Some
high fives Michelle finds Kurt and holds out her hand

MICHELLE
Well done

Kurt looks a little reluctant to accept her praise but he
smiles and shakes her hand As the group breaks up Michelle
approaches Anna - who seems preoccupied

MICHELLE (CONTD)
I had an idea about Vincent
We could give him the job
organizing the wrap party

ANNA
That is a good idea

MICHELLE
I know in the past I always shot
down the idea of throwing Vincent
make-work but now

Anna closes the conference room door This worries Michelle

MICHELLE (CONTD)
What is it

ANNA
Robert’s fucking someone

MICHELLE
(completely cool)
You know that

ANNA
I imagine I always knew abstractly

MICHELLE
And now

ANNA
I smelled it That sort of fruity
body wash they use in hotels that
are trying to be classy When
Robert travels he usually stays in
Motel sixes

MICHELLE
That’s all

ANNA
Then I smelled his underwear I
waited anxiously all day for him to
take off his jockey shorts and when
he finally did I pounced on them
Sniffing I was ashamed even before
I did it

Michelle looks at her friend with great understanding

MICHELLE
Shame is too weak an emotion to
prevent anything Anything at all

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- EVENING 132

Michelle is in her new cheap underwear getting dressed for
the party She sees that the length of a blue dress fails to
hide the bruises on her thighs so she goes with a red one

INT A-V OFFICES -- NIGHT 133

PARTY MUSIC drifts from further in An arriving Patrick
looking like he stepped out of a Sears catalogue hands his
coat to a girl at the improvised garderobe He bumps into
Richard who’s doing the same thing

RICHARD
Hello You’re becoming a fixture at
these things

PATRICK
Looks like it

RICHARD
Your wife

PATRICK
She couldn’t make it

RICHARD

(knowingly)

Ah

PATRICK
Ah

Richard shakes his head Never mind

RICHARD
We should have come together We
could’ve carpooled

Heading in they are met by Vincent a little stiff in a too-
tight suit but overflowing with bonhomie

VINCENT
Pretty classy spread huh Did you
see the candy dishes by the entrance
(noting Patrick) )
Hey how are you doing

Vincent shakes Patrick’s hand motions for them to follow

VINCENT (CONTD)
Right this way monsieurs

PATRICK
Are you the maitre d’ tonight

VINCENT
My mother gave me the job of pretty
much organizing the whole party

RICHARD
I did notice the candy dishes
That’s a nice touch

VINCENT
That was my idea

Michelle making the rounds trades smiles with Anna who sits
at a table with Kurt and Robert She then sees Vincent
leading in Richard and Patrick past tables where people are
eating buffet-style and CONSOLES set up everywhere on which
guests can play the demo level of “Nocturnus”

As Michelle goes to meet them Robert follows her with his
eyes ignoring whatever Anna’s saying to him He glares and
pounds Scotch watching Michelle greet Patrick with a kiss

Michelle hugs Richard then nods to one of the game consoles

MICHELLE
Want to give it a try

PATRICK
I’m not really a game person

MICHELLE
No

Patrick looks a tad uncomfortable Richard jumps at the
chance to play

VINCENT
There’s no wine on the table

Vincent hastens to correct this Patrick takes a seat at the
table across from Robert not picking up on the vibes of
jealousy coming off the other man

At the bar Vincent accosts the RED-VEST BARTENDER

VINCENT (CONTD)
A bottle of red

BARTENDER
I was told to pour everything in
glasses

VINCENT

I want a bottle

BARTENDER
I don’t know if I can do that
VINCENT
What
BARTENDER
I was given very specific
instructions
VINCENT

I need a bottle

BARTENDER
I’m sorry

VINCENT
I’m supposed to be in charge of
this thing

At the table Michelle walks Richard through the game

MICHELLE
Press X and up at the same the same
time very fast faster

He’s not fast enough He dies He curses as he re-spawns

MICHELLE (CONTD)
Where’s Héléne I think we’re past
that aren’t we

RICHARD
I’m not sparing your feelings
She’s not with me because that’s

over

MICHELLE
(sincerely concerned)
What happened

He dies again in the game This time he stops playing

RICHARD
We were laying in bed and I asked
her which of my books was her
favorite

MICHELLE
Richard why

RICHARD
She said “Scent of Poplar”

Michelle draws a blank Richard smiles grimly

RICHARD (CONTD)
“Scent of Poplar” is a novel
written by a Robert Casamayou

MICHELLE
I didn’t even know there was
another Jansen

RICHARD
Apparently he’s pretty good

MICHELLE
(with sympathy)
Richard

RICHARD
Poor Richard

They share smiles and walk away from the console Michelle
places a hand on Kevin’s shoulder in passing He stiffens as
if he were under arrest

MICHELLE
You should circulate

KEVIN
I will

He breathes again as Michelle smiles and moves on bringing
Richard to their table

As she takes the seat next to him Patrick is looking toward
the bar where Vincent seems to be having heated words with
the bartender

MICHELLE
He’s a project in the early stages
of development

It looks like somehow despite all
our determined efforts we have a
success on our hands There’s no
explanation for it except for the
talent brilliance and extreme
dedication of everyone in this
room So all I can say is thank
you and I guess cheers

Everybody drinks Then people look at Michelle excepting her
to say something Someone from the techies’ table shouts
“speech” Michelle rises with her glass

MICHELLE
Ditto

Laughter drinking Sitting back down Michelle observes the
body language of Anna with Robert He’s holding court across
the table she’s trying not to be amused but he whispers in
her ear and gets a smile out of her The sight disturbs
Michelle

Vincent circles the table juggling a tray of glasses of red
wine placing them in front of people like a clumsy waiter

INT AV OFFICES -- LATER 135

People are dancing now The music is LOUD Patrick looks
mortified by the idea of but he lets Michelle drag him out of
his chair He takes her in his arms and attempting to move to
the music but he dances as if he were constipated

MICHELLE
It’s ok It’s alright

Patrick tries to loosen up his posture Resting against her
dance partner Michelle sees Robert watching them Seething
Like a pouting baby Robert stalks over to one of the
consoles and picks up a game controller

Michelle looks the other way and sees Anna dutifully
joylessly playing hostess To Patrick-

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
Excuse me

Michelle goes over to Anna Anna looks up cheerfully
Michelle doesn’t give her a chance to say anything

MICHELLE (CONTD)
It’s me I’m the one Robert’s been
fucking I ended it but it happened

Anna remains hard to read There are no fireworks

ANNA
How long
MICHELLE
Half a year Eight months

Anna has tears in her eyes She nods

ANNA
Oh That’s great I really didn’t
have a clue

MICHELLE
I know

Anna finds she has nothing to say Before she can cry or do
anything embarrassing she walks away Michelle feels a
tremor She looks toward Patrick He motions “let’s get out
of here” She raises a finger “one moment” then walks in
the opposite direction

She passes Robert sitting there with the game controller in
his hands He witnessed Anna walking away upset

ROBERT
What did you do

MICHELLE
I stopped lying

Michelle keeps going She tracks down Vincent who is smoking
by a window with his tie loosened looking down She hands
Vincent her car keys He doesn’t understand

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
You can have the car Patrick’s
giving me a ride home

VINCENT
People are leaving already

MICHELLE
Vincent everything’s gone
beautifully You can relax now Go
talk to Kevin he’ll show you a
demo of the new Western game he’s
working on

VINCENT
Is that cool

Michelle nods Of course

INT PATRICK’S CAR -- NIGHT 136

Michelle and Patrick drive in ominous silence Michelle looks
over at him looks away He seems to sense her glance and
looks at her More silence Finally ahead Michelle sees her
house come into view

MICHELLE
It’s sick

Patrick looks at her not sure he heard her right

PATRICK
What

MICHELLE
It’s sick and wrong - what’s gone
on between us It’s diseased

Patrick looks very uncomfortable with this conversation

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
I was in some kind of weird denial
or I don’t know what But I’m
seeing clearly now

PATRICK
What are you seeing

MICHELLE
You can’t possibly expect to get
away with what you’ve done Can you

Patrick looks at her Sizing her up
MICHELLE (CONTD)

I’m going to do what I should have
done the first day

PATRICK
What do you mean

MICHELLE
It’s not just me I have to think
about It’s your wife Other

women possibly God knows

PATRICK
What do you mean exactly

MICHELLE
How many others are there That
youve done the same thing too

The working of his jaw is the only sign of whatever’s going
on inside Patrick

MICHELLE (CONTD)

I’m going to the police I won’t

spare myself I’m going to tell

them everything
He stops the car right in the middle of the street He looks
at her working his jaw She looks him in the eyes then she
hits her door and gets out
EXT STREET -- NIGHT 137
Michelle walks toward her house in the middle of the street
lit by the headlights of his loudly idling car As if daring
him to run her over Only when she reaches her front walk
does Michelle turn back toward those sinister headlights

She gives him a look A silent “well”

Patrick kills his motor Now Michelle proceeds inside

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 138
Michelle leaves the door unlocked behind her She walks to
the middle of the room lets her jacket drop to the floor and
stands there waiting for him

She watches the front door excitement edging into impatience

Patrick however appears out of the back hallway Wearing
his black ski-mask

For a moment they just stand there like that Looking

Then Michelle breaks for the door and Patrick rushes to
intercept her She shoves an ottoman at him It hits his legs
but only slows him down by a couple of seconds Patrick grabs
her before she gets to the door Grabs her by the arm twists
her around and thumps her good right in the face sending
her sprawling to the floor

Michelle starts screaming- loudly- as Patrick falls on her
tearing at her clothes He fumbles with his zipper For a
second he has trouble She sees this and for just that
moment stops fighting back Like a time-out But a moment
later they’re back at it

She fights back tooth and nail She sinks her teeth into the
flesh above his wrist He howls and hits her again He rips
away her cheap panties with one good yank

She screams louder and louder as Patrick slides in between
her legs only stopping abruptly as she sees Vincent
standing behind Patrick

Patrick’s skull makes a loud CRACK as Vincent bludgeons him
with a fireplace log Before she can say boo

Michelle kicks free of Patrick’s body as it collapses on top
of her BLOOD oozes through the ski mask like cream through a
sieve Vincent gawks in horror as Patrick in dying spasms
Pulling the tatters of her dress around her Michelle’s first
and only thought is to hurry Vincent out of the room to
shield him from the horror

VINCENT
He’s Is he

MICHELLE
It’s alright You’re ok I’m
alright everything’s alright

Mother and son are both horrified as the masked figure now
rises slowly pulling himself to his feet Michelle positions
herself defensively in front of Vincent

But Patrick doesn’t come toward them He reaches up and pulls
off his mask Vincent is astonished to see who it is

Patrick looks as if he we trying to frame a question as blood
streams down one side of his face He turns looking for the
door He takes a half-step then collapses Almost a pratfall

VINCENT
Is he dead

Patrick lies there eyes open blood spreading like a halo
around his head across the parquet floor He is dead

MICHELLE
It’s alright It’s alright

She puts her arms around her son He holds onto her sobbing

INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM -- LATER 139

The home is a crime scene AUTHORITIES surround the body
taking pictures making notes Michelle watches the activity
from where she’s being questioned by a DETECTIVE

DETECTIVE
What was your relationship with the
deceased

MICHELLE
He was my neighbor

DETECTIVE
A neighbor

MICHELLE
A neighbor

DETECTIVE
Like have a cup of coffee borrow a
lawnmower kind of neighbor

MICHELLE
There was never any exchange of
lawnmowers - but I get what you
mean and yes generally we were
neighbors like that Until maybe
recently

DETECTIVE
He had attended this party with you
as a date

MICHELLE
Yes

DETECTIVE
Youre relationship had turned
romantic

Distracted Michelle’s eyes are drawn to the crime scene

MICHELLE
It was heading in that direction

DETECTIVE
You returned together

MICHELLE
I told him I wasn’t feeling well
That’s why we left the party He
dropped me off out front I’m
sorry

She needs a moment She watches all the police activity

MICHELLE (CONTD)
I’ve been here before There’s deja
vu and then there’s this

A destroyed Vincent slumps on the couch surrounded by
officers One hands him a glass of water He guzzles it
Vincent notices the way the cop is looking at him He doesn’t
recognize the look at first

COP
Don’t beat yourself up son The
truth is you deserve a goddamn
medal for what you did

Vincent now recognizes the look approval admiration even
That sinks in Slowly he smiles Michelle watches Vincent
from across the room

MICHELLE
I went in started to get undressed
and he was there This figure
Standing there Wearing a mask

DETECTIVE
And did you have any clue that it
was your neighbor Mr Forrester
Looking at Vincent she knows what she has to do
MICHELLE
Who could imagine such a thing
140 INT MICHELLE’S HOUSE -- DAY 140
Michelle walks through the house Everything’s been
repainted Where Patrick died new carpeting She opens a

window to light a cigarette

She sees MOVING VANS across the street

EXT MICHELLE HOUSE -- DAY

Michelle comes out of the house Rebecca wearing black is
there directing the movers Her expression changes a little

when she sees Michelle approaching Uncertainty

REBECCA
Michelle

MICHELLE
You found a buyer

REBECCA
I took a little bit of a hit but
not bad My realtor did a wonderful
job - I can give you his name if
you like If you ever

MICHELLE
I’m not going anywhere

Rebecca smiles nods A mover passes with a chair

REBECCA
So much crap piles up

Michelle smiles politely briefly

MICHELLE
I wanted you to know I’m very sorry
for what you’ve been through

REBECCA
I claim to have faith What’s it
for if not to get through times
like this Patrick was a good man
but he had a tortured soul

Michelle nods again She’s about to politely exit but Rebecca

stops her adding one more thing-

REBECCA (CONTD)
I’m sincerely glad you were able to
give him what he needed For a
while anyway

Michelle looks at Rebecca The realization that this woman
knows the truth of Patrick’s death chills her Michelle nods

to the vans

MICHELLE
Good luck

Rebecca nods back Michelle leaves her

EXT CEMETERY

Michelle puts
built into an
vault next to

-- DAY 142

flowers in front of her mother’s little vault
onyx wall She pointedly ignores the unmarked
it that contains her father Vandals have

already scrawled “monster” and “burn in hell” on that one

Michelle turns and finds she’s not alone Anna’s there

ANNA

I heard you were here

MICHELLE

Physically anyway

They stand silently side by side

ANNA

We’re going ahead with Richards
project

MICHELLE

I’m going to let him fool around for
a while I expected him to throw
my charity back in my face but he
didn’t Something’s gone out of him

ANNA
Robert showed up drunk at the
office this morning Security
escorted him out What did you
see in him anyway

MICHELLE
It was more about happenstance
opportunity I just wanted to get
laid

ANNA
That’s no excuse It was very
shabby

MICHELLE

It was that and worse

ANNA
Vincent’s grown up It’s just the
two of us now And I’m stuck with
that mausoleum of a house I’m
going to sell it I was thinking
I could move in with you for a
while

Michelle looks at Anna unsure of the implication

MICHELLE
Oh

END
