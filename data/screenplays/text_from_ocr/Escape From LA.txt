Human body parts are on display like filets of fish on

Gucci now offers body pieces fashioned from spare car
Armani displays more eclectic high priced pieces sewn
like sculptures in their windowfronts A giant rift
streets center Acrid smoke rises

The throng stops at an intersection and Plisskens
anchored in the middle of the street Surrounding the
are patients of every size age sex

Plissken looks over sees another cross being carried
planted right next to his A beautiful girl is tied to
This is TASLIMA 20s Iranian the face of a Persian
Shes dressed in black leather and basically has an IQ

TASLIMA

Hi Snake Its so great to meet you My

names Taslima Im a fan of yours

PLISSKEN
Are you crazy

TASLIMA

A little bit But pretty soon Im gonna be

dead So are you Snake

Plissken looks across the street Our of the ruins of
famous red door of Elizabeth Arden come an arm of women
with acid-burned faces from one-too-many skin peelings

knives saws horrible-looking carving instruments

TASLIMA
I cant believe I got caught
(sighs)

I run with Midnight Jihad Iranian gang
Only they kicked me out cause I screw up
sometimes I forget stuff

Plissken struggles with his bonds

TASLIMA
I left my boyfriends place tonight took
a wrong turn

The throng of facialists patients interns and nurses

Plissken and Taslima on the crosses They move back to

sidewalks as the auction for body parts cut freshly

and Taslima is about to begin The gurneys are wheeled

and set up as large cutting tables The facialists take

positions behind the tables waiting to carve fresh

PLISSKEN
What are they

TASLIMA

They live here used to be like us But
after too many silicon implants their
muscles turned to jelly The only way they
survive is to have body parts transplanted
over and over again

(whispers)

Snake nobody who comes into Beverly Hills
gets out alive

PLISSKEN
No screamin shit

TASLIMA
Oh no its the Doctor

PLISSKEN
Who

TASLIMA
The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills

THE DOCTOR THE SURGEON GENERAL OF BEVERLY HILLS

Steps out into the street He appears incredibly
gorgeous a hunk

of a man put together by the finest body parts
available in

Beverly Hills - a millennium Fabio - but upon closer
examination

hes got no lower jaw Instead there is a rusting
metal grid-work

attached beneath each ear It never moves He can
actually speak

through a metal box attached to his windpipe

THE DOCTOR

Stands in front of them He raises his hands to quiet
the crowd

He walks around the cross admiring the beautiful
bodies before

him He tickles the fine flesh with his right hand
which is made

up of 10 gleaming scalpels which form a 360 degree
cutting edge

THE DOCTOR

ve never seen more beautiful specimens
There will be no auction tonight These
body parts will go to those who need them
the most

The crowd gumbles

PLISSKEN

Turns his head sideways to a small hidden pocket near
his neck

With his teeth he pulls out the silver mouth dart
slips it onto

his tongue closes his mouth

The doctor raises his gleaming scalpel hand and steps
toward
Plissken

THE DOCTOR
What a beautiful blue eye Its a shame
positions it

he is face

A nurse brings over a small step-ladder The doctor
in front of Plissken slowly climbs up the rungs until

to face with him The doctor looks ready to pluck

freezes his scalpel hand raised his eyes clouding He
forward

The scalpel hand swings misses its mark and instead

rope tied around Plisskens wrist WHATCK The ropes

Plissken grabs the scalpel hand with his free hand
hand and legs loose in a flash and pushes the doctor
the step-ladder

WHUMP Plissken falls to the intersection almost at
as the doctor hits the pavement

The patients are stunned Motionless They stare at
lying in the street moaning moving slightly

Snake starts to run

TASLIMA

Slowly the light takes form It is a single gigantic
floating in pitch-black darkness It continues coming -
larger and larger Suddenly the sewer begins to echo
blasting ringing sound Music

Its incredibly LOUD SALSA MUSIC

From out of the tunnel drives an ancient golf cart

On a metal pole in front is a huge lighted eye such as

light comes from the eye on the front of the vehicle

PENDEJO BOB

Plissken and Utopia fly through the air and land with
a thud on

top of a Mescalito car as the Cadillac begins to swerve
wildly

Cuervo Jones grabs the wheel desperately tries to
control the

Caddy but fails The Cadillac careens off the
street slams

into the palm tree spins around and crashes into the
remains of a

hot dog stand

slides along the sidewalk burning rubber
PLISSKEN AND UTOPIA

Are thrown forward They tumble off the roof across
the hood

and land on the sidewalk in front of the car They roll
to a stop

as the car screeches to a stop inches from their
heads as the

caravan suddenly puts on its brakes

Screaming tires Cars jackknifing spinning in a
massive traffic
collision

Cuervo Jones emerges from the remains of the Cadillac

Plissken drags Utopia into the street grabs the lid of
a manhole
in the street pries it up

Mescalitos pour out of their vehicles as Cuervo Jones
charges
into the street pointing at Plissken

CUERVO JONES
Kill him kill him

Plissken lifts Utopia to her feel hauls her over to

THE SHEER PITCH-BLACK DROP OFF

One side of the passage the same one we saw earlier on
our
journey with Pendejo Bob

Plissken spins Utopia around pushes her backward
toward the drop-
off his eye burning into her

Her feet reach the very edge

Plissken holds her there Utopias face is a mask of
sheer terror

She gulps air in staccato bursts

Beat Beat

Plissken cant do it He cant push her off

He releases her backs up looks at the prototype then
pulls one

of his revolvers from its holster cocks the hammer

aims

Slowly Utopia moves from the edge of the drop off
down the tunnel then stops looks back at Plissken

Plissken glances at the prototype then at her

Map To The Stars Eddie takes aim - a head shot
Plissken spins and dives off the edge

and drops the prototype with a CLANK
CLOSE - PROTOTYPE
A red light comes on blinks urgently

PROTOTYPE VOICE

(tiny filtered)

I am now armed and ready for use Use
extreme caution The location of the
effected blast area can only be determined
by the orbital position of the SatStar

Everyone in the tunnel is frozen unable to move
Slowly Cuervo

Jones picks up the prototype stares at it then breaks
into a

smile

CUERVO JONES
This is turning out to be my lucky day
(stares coldly at Map To The
Stars Eddie)
Get this asshole outta here

Several Mescalitos grab Map To The Stars Eddie pull

him back

along the tunnel

MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE

Cuervo Jones turns to Utopia who stands numbly staring
off at the

drop-off He walks over to her then slaps her hard
viciously

across the face
Utopia reacts to the stinging slap

UTOPIA

CUERVO JONES

Plissken grabs it with his good hand

Now hang on

Plissken wraps his good hand and arm in the noose as
jerks the line hard Plissken is in mid-swing and the
jerking pulls him abruptly in the opposite direction

Disneyland gone to hell A huge sign reads THE HAPPY

The gates no longer exist The overhead tram lies
ground Slowly vehicles drive straight inside

A battered old limousine carries Cuervo Jones anda
Utopia past the ruins of the train and around the
square of Main Street Ahead is the fairy castle
crumbling like some relic from a nightmare Around it
thrill rides tossed in to a jumbled mass by the force
original earthquake

Crowds are waiting Gangs of every conceivable

jumps cowering

CUERVO JONES

A terrified smile spreads across Utopias face

EXT MAIN STREET - NIGHT

engines begin bouncing up and down wildly on hydraulic
Gangs begin cheering firing their weapons into the air

At the end of Main Street is a huge open area - almost
beyond which are parked a literal army of helicopters
As the limousine stops and Cuervo Jones emerges

arm the cheering begins a wall of sound through the
Black Muslims step out to greet Cuervo dressed in

headgear and sunglasses wearing black capes and

Thompson machine guns They stop give the right-handed
salute One of them BIVOUAC speaks to Cuervo

Map To The Stars Eddie suddenly grabs Cuervo as if to
protect him

and manages to wrap himself around the prototype in
Cuervos hand

At the same moment Bivouac and the Black Muslim open
fire on an

old storefront behind Cuervo Jones The place is
shredded

Cuervo Jones pulls Map To The Stars Eddie up off the
ground and
grabs what looks like the prototype out of his

clutches
