FADE IN
A MAN RUNNING

In ragged torn oversized clothes Running for all he’s
worth while struggling to hold onto his pants --

Early morning Empty streets

He stumbles finally gives up on the pants and lets them
drop --

The man is naked now still making a mad dash for safety --
DOWN AN ALLEY --

He tries the doors on a tenament slum building Finds one
open

INSIDE
A long-abandoned building Down halls Up stairs Up
A ROOM

A torn-up mattress some junk food wrappers empty bottles
broken furniture old soiled clothing --

The man huddles in the corner against the wall Weak
Feverish Tormented All the symptoms of addiction He
runs a hand through his hair and it comes out in clumps

Silence A boarded-up window lets in daggers of dawn’s
light Now only the man’s labored breathing A good look
at him now huddled against the wall --

DR BRUCE BANNER night be handsome in other circumstances
Now he’s just desperate

WHMP WHMP WHMP Chopper blades beat the air outside
SIRENS closing

SOUNDS Cars trucks Running feet Guns loading
cocking More equipment

AMPLIFIED VOICE (0S)
This is the United States Army
The area has been cordoned off
You are surrounded

Banner looks around helplessly What does the human mind
think of at a time like this

He finds some oil-stained pants two sizes too big Pimp
pants purple He pulls them on te cover his nakedness A
length of dirty rope cinches them around his waist
«

VOICE (0S)
I’m going to count down fron
ten If you don’t come out
were coming in

Banner holds the filthy clothing tightly to his body a
last link to a vanishing humanity --

VOICE (0S)
Whoever you are you can’t
escape Ten
A HEARTBEAT is faintly audible and we wonder when it began

VOICE (0S)
Nine eightseven

BEAT Banner covers his ears A tear runs down his face -

VOICE six fivefour

BEAT BEAT The heartbeat drowns out all other sounds
HIS HANDS seem momentarily distorted Oversized cables
knot and ripple bunching beneath the skin --

I’11 hurt you
BEATING TOO FAST NOW THE MAN’S EYES SHUT TIGHT --
cur

A TICKING SOUND replaces his heartbeat steady and
mechanical --

ON A GREEN LIGHT - SUPER TWO MONTHS AGO

Flickering flaring glowing like a small sun dark
filaments arcing --

Brilliant and beautiful but as the CAMERA PULLS BACK it’s
only a reflection we’re seeing The ticking comes faster

An image in the eyes of a monster A bug-eyed heavy-
skinned monster

SUPER LOS OSOS TEST SITE NEVADA DESERT
The ticking is the urgent staccato of a geiger counter
THE MONSTER IS A MAN -

Under layers of technology a radiation suit helmet and
protective goggles at a lead-glassed work station He’s
operating an insulated radiation sleeve

INSIDE THE RADIATION CHAMBER --

Two tiny pieces of exotic liquid metal on a calibrated
ratchet Gamadium-282 The greenish light flares as they
are brought closer together In the air between them a
plasma shape ebbs and flows like a living thing --

The ticking races faster and faster running together into
almost a constant drone now --

The light brightens filling the chamber washing out
detail in the man’s face except for the barest hint of a
smile His lips move and an electronically-transmitted
play-by play echoes --

VOICE (VO)
»material required for critical
mass almost negligible Purity
seems to be the sole determinant of
stability and fusionability

Underneath the gear the man’s attention is unwavering
emotionless Satisfied he moves the calibration units
apart and the colors fade from the air as the clicks drop
down to a steady safe rhythmic beat

The man slips out of the sleeve flips the protective
goggles up and removes his helmet It’s our man --

DR BRUCE BANNER 30s is a man of singular intensity
part Oppenheimer part Einstein He runs his fingers
through a thick mop of hair clearly unused to a comb --

BANNER (CONT’D)
The gadget is feasible
gentlemen

A muffled smattering of APPLAUSE shakes him from his
obsession Behind a thick pane of glass above him --

OBSERVATION ROOM
SCIENTISTS and TECHNICIANS watch monitoring equipment
printing out a steady flow of graphs and charts While
Banner replaces the gamadium-282 into tiny lead-glassed
canisters and sets them in padded containment cases

BANNER (CONT’D)
Edward the delivery system needs
recalibration as I suspected

EDWARD LEDER unremarkable-looking looks up --

BANNER (CONT’D)
Leder are you

Leder fumbles for a mike and responds --

LEDER
Right here Dr Banner

BANNER
This time my specifications
alright

LEDER’S NOTEBOOK is a mass of inky frustration Variations
on a formula are crossed out and attempted again Confused
question marks underlined

Leder looks around self-consciously at the reproach and
nods No one likes being publicly corrected but this looks
like a guy who’s used to it by now

The room thins out printouts go to analysis overdue
coffee breaks are taken A technician removes the
containment cases to storage

IN THE LAB - Banner cleans up drops his insulated inner
gioves in a radiation disposal

GEN THUNDERBOLT ROSS enters an imposing presence He’s
earned those three stars and damait a long overdue fourth
too He looks unhappy The General motions SENATOR
STANLEY in behind him Stanley is a conservative ‘aw
shucks politician’ uncomfortable in this hi-tech setting

GEN ROSS
Youve met Senator Stanley

Sen Stanley looks around nervously --
SEN STANLEY
It’s safe in here Dr Banner
The radiation I mean

Banner points to his radiation shield on his ID badge --
)

«

BANNER
You’re perfectly safe Senator
This would turn green if there
were the slightest radiation leak

Stanley examines the radiation shield It’s quite pink

Banner looks

GEN ROSS
The Senator has some news

SEN STANLEY
I wanted to tell you in person if
it’s any consolation I couldn’t
get the support we needed The
Senate appropriations comnittee
killed us Im sorry

to the General --

GEN ROSS
The Gamma project is dead

Banner is a man tight under control you’d never know how

he feels about this The General is another story He

smacks a table Banner winces --

GEN ROSS (CONT’D)
Those bean-counting pencil
pushing idiots What do they
think keeps this nation safe
and secure In their dreans
what do they imagine preserves
the American Way of life

SEN STANLEY
You’re preaching to the already
converted General

GEN ROSS
It’s our technological edge
damnit And they’re pissing it
away

SEN STANLEY
It’s their argument that were
dismantling more bombs now than
we know what to do with

BANNER
This is different We’re
harnessing an entirely new energy
source Gamma technology will make
nuclear power look like a candle in
acave The potential

A glimmer of Banner’s passion for the project The Senator
puts a hand on his shoulder then looks at the radiation
precautions and withdraws it wiping it on his suit

SEN STANLEY
It’s too late The cold war’s
over son The Gamma Project
has been re-classified and
slated for dismantling

BANNER
But the prototypes I can show
them something in maybe six
months if we push it

SEN STANLEY
No tests Scrap ’em Banner
you’ll supervise Then well
good luck son You’ll do fine

Sen Stanley exits Gen Ross turns angrily to Banner --

GEN ROSS
Your delays cost us Banner
Your precautions

BANNER

But you know we‘re working with
gamadium-282 -- it’s an untested
unstable transuranium nuclei a
superheavy element that has the
misfortune to tend toward
spontaneous fission presenting us
a sweet little problem In order
to control the highly penetrative

gamma-rays weve had to

Pure passion without a trace of sarcasm Of course it’s
techno-babble to us and Gen Ross -

GEN ROSS
Blah blah blah Expensive words
It doesn’t matter now does it A
half a billion dollars Banner
You went way over budget and have
got nothing to show for it You’re
a weak sister You let your
country down The good news is
that next week you’re unemployed
and I don’t have to look at you any
more you milksop

The General gives Banner a disgusted look and heads for the

exit

At the last moment Banner stops hin with --

Were ready to hit Gen Ross but not Banner If he’s
angry it’s bottled up in self-blame --

BANNER
»-nothing I should’ve

GEN ROSS
You should’ve

fhe General slams the door behind him Banner is alone
Expressionless He starts stacking papers and notebooks

THE OBSERVATION ROOM is empty now except for LEDER who
watches Banner start to clean out the lab --

LEDER
(to himself)
You blew it genius

EXT SCENIC OVERLOOK - HOOVER DAM - DAY

A wonder of human engineering MARY the woman behind the
camera looks like a typical tourist but there is a hint
of Eastern European hardness to her to go with the vague
accent Beside her is GUS a crew-cut who looks like he
should be in a bowling league somewhere (or training rebels
in Central America)

MARY
Incredible There is nothing
like American engineering

cus
Ingenuity

Gus checks his gold Rolex as Leder walks up --
MARY
You’re late We took a risk
coming here
Leder’s nervous trying to look cool --
LEDER
You took a risk I’m only

sneaking off a top secret military
installation

GUS
What’ve you got
f LEDER

The fashion accessory for the
terrorist group who needs to
put an exclamation point on
their political statements
The Gamma bomb

Mary turns to Gus impressed --

MARY
Weve heard of it It could be
worth a fortune North Korea
Pakistan we can take our pick
in the niddle east

Gus
You’re bowling in the big
leagues Banner’s new bomb

LEDER
Banner‘s I put ten years of
my life on this I helped
engineer the delivery system

Gus
Of course But intelligence
reports say only Banner knows
x the big picture

LEDER
I can get his notebooks And I
can get my hands on a cannister of
pure gamadium-282 US weapons
grade A golf-ball will be able
to level a city and no other
country will be in a position to
manufacture it for at least
another twenty years

MARY
How do we know it works

LEDER
Because Banner’s a goddamn genius

MARY
What warranties does a buyer have

LEDER
Aw hell this isn’t Radio
Shack guys

6 Leder self-consciously looks around and lowers his voice
q)

Gus
Were talking about a lot of
money You want to make this
happen We need documentation

Leder’s being squeezed uncomfortably and he’s a little man

LEDER
Like test data

GUs
That11 do it Government
letterhead of course

MARY
But how are you going to get
test data without a boom

In her greed the accent comes out On Leder Little men
are dangerous He resigns himself to a risky idea --

LEDER
There‘ll be a boon

INT GAMMA LAB - NIGHT

Banner’s stack of notebooks on a desk His lab coat on the
chair ID badge pinned to it

A HAND opens the top notebook Every page is scribbled and
ink-stained with what looks like an alien language
science CLICK The pages flip Symbols and
calculations Dense with brilliance CLICK Fast-food
wrappers with notations scribbled on them stapled and
glued in place Arrows direct work from one thought to
another Exclamation points and question marks
Passionate work CLICK CLICK

A TINY SPY CAMERA CLICKS AND WINDS A flashlight clenched
between teeth A pic of Banner’s ID badge on the lab coat

The notebooks Notes surround a sketch of a unique bomb
casing labelled the Gadget The G-Bomb Written on the
casing in script Bad Betty

THE MAN writes the name on his hand with a pen Suddenly
lab lights come up A DOCTOR is at the door to the lab --

VOICE
Who’s there The lab’s closed

Oh it’s you

LEDER
I was just cleaning up
The doctor notices and approaches the desk --

DOCTOR
What are you doing

As the doctor crossesto him clutched behind Leder’s back
is a metal Enola Gay paperweight --

DOCTOR (CONTD)
These are Banner’s

Leder brings the paperweight down on the man’s head
Instead of dropping like dead weight the Doctor pitches

forward grabbing at the back of his head and
pain -

Not like the movies Leder panics curses under his breath
and chases the thrashing man through the lab swinging
wildly missing as often as he connects --

LEDER
(hissing whisper)
‘Shut up Dammit shut up

The Doctor yells Things break loudly Furniture
overturned Noise Mess Leder is a bumbler

The Doctor finally trips and falls hitting his head hard
on a desk corner as he goes down This quiets him Leder
freezes breathing hard Outside draw
closer --

Leder bends over the fallen doctor and smashes his shin
into a chair He yipes in pain then grits through it and
checks the Doctor’s pulse Leder looks around frantically
as footsteps get closer --

Leder grabs a metal chair raises it and swings down hard
out of frame There’s a nasty sound and Leder is frozen
for a moment as he nearly retches at his own handiwork
He‘’s in over his head and not cut out for this He smashes
a window with the chair setting off alarms He climbs
through into the night just before the MP’s burst in --

soldiers --

ROSS
Excuse me soldier I’m looking
for Old Iron Butt

SOLDIER
The General’s at the test range

The soldier points down a dirt road angling out of the
town As she drives off he does a double-take because
Betty is too young and too beautiful to be this confident

EXT THE NEVADA DESERT - DAY

Vast unending Mountains rise up from the high desert
floor One road cuts across the bleak landscape A cloud
of dust off in the distance

A CAR - A late model sedan approaching --

A CYCLONE FENCE FROSTED WITH RAZOR WIRE extends to the
horizon There’s nothing to differentiate the empty land
inside the fence from the land outside except a sign

MILITARY INSTALLATION NO TRESPASSING

THE GUARD HOUSE beside it In the middle of nowhere A
HAYSERD GUARD stops reading and hides a worn copy of
Strange Tales 89 into his pocket He approaches the car

HAYSEED GUARD
This is a restricted government
installation

He does a jaw-drop when the driver lowers her sunglasses --

BETTY ROSS would get that reaction a lot of places but out
here where they don’t get many pretty women -

BANNER plays it with one hand while he eats a sandwich with
another Sitting in the hot desert sun until a shadow
passes He squints up at BETTY ROSS sunglasses on

ROSS
Hello stranger

Banner couldbe the nerd you never talked to in high
school He doesn’t know what to say to women The men
around him have noticed Ross and watch as they slack off
Banner reacts to the men he knows what to say to them --

remora including Maj Talbot

GEN ROSS

The General and Ross his daughter share an awkward
greeting

ROSS
They still call you Iron Butt

GEN ROSS
Not to my face they don’t
What brings you here

ROSS

to as the diaper from Langley

Maj Talbot smiles She’s tough and she knows the score
The General frowns --

GEN ROSS
Why would they send you Honey

ROSS
I’m qualified and I requested
it General

GEN ROSS
Of course I just expected
Dammnit it’s good to see you

Maj Talbot extends a hand He’s a comer sees the
politics of an attractive woman with a three star father

Some enlisted men have put together a decent rhythm and
blues band and they play in a corner

falbot’s getting personal He tends to do pretty well with
the ladies and he’s in mid-pitch

MAJ TALBOT
with a career army officer
for a father nothing you ever
did quite measured up because
you weren’t a boy It was
tough but I bet you can
probably hit a curve ball

Talbot’s good We’re not sure how Ross feels about the
capsule review --

ROSS
Throw one I played pitcher

ROSS’ POV - As BANNER enters and sits alone at the end
of the bar

Ross notices gathers her files and exits on a deadpan -
ROSS (CONT’D)
You’re incredibly perceptive
Major Excuse ne please

THE BAR She sits down beside Banner as the bartender
slides him a glass mug of warmed milk

ROSS (CONT’D)
Well Banner it’s nice to know
some things haven’t changed

Banner turns pleasantly surprised --

BANNER
What do you mean I grew up
No Bosco

Over in the corner Talbot watches --

BANNER (CONT’D)
I see you made a new friend

Ross looks surprised that Banner noticed --

ROSS
Talbot He’s just a sheep in
wolf’s clothing

Banner likes that --

BANNER
If we asked your father he’d
say the Major’s just your type

ROSS
That’s why we don‘t ask my
father But I’m flattered
After all this time you’re
jealous

Banner really doesn’t know how to flirt --

BANNER
No I was just

ROSS

He points to his head -

And they can’t close this down

Ross smiles admiringly then -

ROSS
You always had a brilliant
mind Bruce Why use it to

fundamental questions about the
universe

ROSS
And the bombs finance the answers

BANNER
They used to

Brighter than a thousand suns We’ve never seen one like

It’s a three-stage bomb An A-bomb trigger compresses the
gamadium core to critical mass conversion to high-energy
neutrons is 100 efficient in Banner’s unique design and
these impact on an outer shell of gamadiun causing fusion
of the gamadium nuclei and maximizing the explosive yield
and the radioactivity --

vaporized by his shadow burned into the ground beneath hin

through him

illuminating every cell and every organ as if he were
suddenly transparent Invisible yet we are able to see hin

His face is stretched frozen in a scream Pure agony But
no sound comes out Not a cell in his body can hide fron
the radiation pouring through him Unendurable hell just
to watch him twist in slow motion -

earthquake Rick collapses to the concrete floor and holds
his ears

driving across the desert and past Banner like a

powerful for that What’s clear is that it doesn’t have a
normal human pallor The hand finds purchase on the side
of the building and pushes --

Terrifyingly there must be a body attached to this hand
but we can’t see it --

We can’t make it out

LEDER (0S)
It’s an electromagnetic disruption
caused by gamma rays

LEDER is standing at the door

LEDER (CONT’D)
Another application of Banner’s
research

GEN ROSS
Leder

LEDER
Feeling a thousand percent
better General thank you

And he looks it His eyes bright skin clear and clean
But something is different it’s subtle the cadence of
his speech the rhythm - like a much more intelligent man
But that’s impossible isn’t it

LEDER (CONT’D)
We all thought of the Gamma-bomb
as merely an outdated weapon of
mass destruction But Banner saw
the seeds of a technology with
applications in everything fron
advanced communications to medical
research The bomb was just the
key to unlock the door It’s so
clear the possibilities

Leder is lost in an intellectual fugue He snaps out of
his reverie with a decision --

LEDER (CONT’D)
His work must be allowed to
continue

GEN ROSS
Glad you’re well but we have
more pressing problems

LEDER
I understand A shame about
Banner

Awash in sincerity Leder exits The General turns angrily
to the remaining brain trust

Banner is stunned --

BANNER
A hundred miles

RICK JONES
Look I owe you and Rick Jones
always gives proper change
But I’m not going back there so
they can send me back to reform
school or worse

Rick gets on the bike and rummages in the side-bag for a
spare jacket and shirt which he tosses to Banner --

RICK JONES (CONT’D)
Put these on

Banner catches them and now notices his own torn clothing
He looks down at his shoes split along the seams toes
visible Something’s wrong with this picture --

Rick kick-starts the bike then pats the seat behind him
encouragingly

You’11 like this She’s great

Banner and Rick sit at a table as MARLO CHANDLER makes her
appearance singing a Nina Simone-type arrangement of
Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood -

RICK JONES (CONT’D)
Ain’t she something

Yes If it’s possible to do something classy in this
setting Marlo does it Slow and sexy Hair and clothing
like a 50s pin-up Moves are all 90’s

Banner is embarrassed agitated stimulated awkward

BEHIND THEM a couple of loud VEGAS COWBOYS wolf-whistle
Rick turns around in disgust and eyes them She’s too
classy for that But what do you expect from this setting

Rick stands up fiercely and turns around --

But the cowboys continue answering to the song --

COWBOY

Rick stands again --

RICK JONES
Hey shut up pencil-dick

The cowboys don’t like this --

COWBOY 2
Don‘t hurt yourself kid It’s
past your bedtime

COWBOY
Yeah she ain’t worth it

A laugh filled with bad teeth

BANNER watches Marlo weave her spell She’s good she’s
sexy These cowboy idiots are ruining it for all of us

RICK JONES
Can’t we get these morons to
shut up

Banner gathers himself and turns around --

BANNER
Why don’t you gentlemen keep it
down so the rest of us can
enjoy the show

The cowboys look at each other

Without getting up one of the cowboys raises a leg and
kicks Banner square in the stomach sending him sprawling
over a chair Rick races to him --

RICK JONES
Doc you okay

Banner’s never been hit like that He struggles to catch
his breath The BOUNCER comes over and addresses the
cowboys --

Rick Jones follows and helps Banner up -

Rick’s hand is around Banners arm which suddenly feels

RICK JONES (CONT’D)
Uh oh Doc

BANNER
No that was wrong

Bouncer takes Banner down to the ground --

BOUNCER (CONT‘D)
Now don’t get all excited
buddy

BANNER on the ground in pain Blood pounding in his ears
His HEARTBEAT begins to quicken We can hear it Above
their heads the neon --

Street lights blink and crackle

Under Banner’s clothes something begins to change Like
hydraulics bunching and expanding but organic --

All 300 pounds of the Bouncer’s weight can’t hold the arn-
leck in place anymore Banner’s arm tears through his

BOUNCER
Jeez what are you

Banner’s skin isn’t pink anymore It’s that sallow
greyish-green we saw back at the base With a GUTTURAL
ROAR that doesn’t sound much like Banner anymore he throws
the Bouncer off easily skipping him like a stone across
the street --

Even in the darkness it’s obvious that what rolls over
isnt Dr Bruce Banner anymore The face is coarser
cruder than what we associate with human a throwback
perhaps a mutation a monster --

THE HULK -
INT DIAMOND LOUNGE - SAME

THE DOOR FRAME SPLINTERS as the Hulk comes through Close
to seven feet tall and massive the overwhelming feeling is
of being in the presence of power This is no pretty-boy
body-builder this is ugly green and mean

MARIO gamely tries to continue as PATRONS SCATTER The
Hulk explodes through tables toward the startled cowboys
one hand is enough to jerk the first hapless cowboy out of
his chair --

Almost casually the Hulk shakes the cowboy like a chicken-
farmer preparing dinner then tosses him across the bar
taking out drinks and drinkers like a cannon shot When he
hits he hits hard

With a speed that belies his appearance Hulk treats the
tables and patrons like stairs as he pursues the second
retreating cowboy across the stage Glasses shatter and
pop like candy Hulk tears curtains down in pursuit --
THE COWBOY grabs the mike stand away from Marlo and swings
for the bleachers It clanga and bends double against the
back of Hulk’s massive head Hulk grabs the cowboy and
throws him helicopter-style across the bar --

THE BARTENDER ducks and comes up with a shotgun --

THE HULK stops in front of Marlo She backs away and he
stops her grabs her by the shoulders each huge hand
wrapping half-way around her back The strength held in
reserve is terrifying but he’s gentle --

He lifts her pulls her close his fetid breath pumping
into her face examining her Marlo is terrified but you
wouldn’t know it unless I told you She’s a tough girl

THE BARTENDER advances with the shotgun levelled at Hulk
but there’s no clear shot past Marlo The Hulk looks at
her searching some dim human memory for recognition --

A frozen moment The whole tableau Then Hulk seems to
vaguely shake his thick head and release her A toy he’s
no longer interested in one hint She’s not Betty
Marlo slumps into Rick Jones’ waiting arms --

BARTENDER
Alright freak --

Hulk turns toward him almost casually And the Bartender
lets go with both barrels --

What’s left of Rick’s old shirt perforates as the Hulk’s
chest darkens with the powder and shot The Hulk takes a
half-step backward with the force but that’s about it He
ROARS with disapproval

Everyone covers their ears from the force of the sound as
they scramble to escape --

The Hulk grabs the piano and lazily tosses it across the
lounge It splinters against the wall and the Bartender
collapses in terror --

The Hulk exits through the fire door his shoulder takes
out a chunk of door frame The FIRE ALARM whoops loudly
RICK JONES turns to Marlo --

RICK JONES
Marlo

MARLO
Rick Jones What are you doing
here Did you see that

RICK JONES
I came to see you baby You
were great

Marlo smiles She’s a couple of years older than Rick but
what he lacks in age he makes up for in attitude 08s
the SCREECH of brakes followed by the unmistakable CRASH of
cars

RICK JONES
Come on Ive got to help a
friend

SIRENS in the distance Rick grabs Marlo’s hand and heads
out the back in the same direction as the Hulk --

Discarded science texts on every surface Chalkboards fill
the room covered with figures Like what we expect from
Banner by a factor of ten Indecipherable Where there’s
no more room the writing continues on the walls

A hand moves as fast as thought stringing out
alphanumerics signs symbols and numbers

breaks SCREETCH The fingers take a moment to register
and finally stop still moving twitching

CAMERA MOVES IN ON LEDER --

He looks tired like a speedfreak at the end of a binge
His skin is sallow Strangely His clothing seems baggy
and his forehead looks imperceptibly longer

He turns from the blackboard and grasps his cramping
writing hand with the other He holds it in pain The
fingers are raw and torn But there’s more so much more
He can’t stop the flow the torrent of ideas pouring from
his unharnessed brain He holds his head the pressure
another headache His temples throb

LEDER
Banner was an idiot He didn’t see
the possibilities of his work

In his moment of revelation a sudden piercing headache
doubles him over He stumbles from his chair and crashes
to floor hands clutching his throbbing temples --

When he looks up his skin seems a shade more translucent
his green-flecked eyes a little more sunken and hollow --
was that green-flecked His headache jabs a lightning
thrust He SCREAMS and lunges for the bathroom door --

IN THE BATHROOM Leder grabs a large aspirin bottle and
crams a fistful inte his mouth like M and M’s It doesn’t do
much maybe the razor edge is off the pain

something he built in the lab

ROSS
He’s a physicist not Dr
Frankenstein

MAJ TALBOT
And you think he’s innocent

ROSS
How can you be so sure he’s
guilty

MAJ TALBOT
Because all the evidence points
to him For starters

ROSS
You don’t like hin

MAJ TALBOT
Honestly Agent Ross No

ROSS
Why because he’s smart What
is it with you jocks Why are
you always threatened by
intelligent men

MAJ TALBOT
I had a well-adjusted childhood I
had a good time at my prom Yes I
was captain of the football team
I graduated number one in my class
at West Point I’m supposed to
feel guilty because of this

ROSS
You’re right I’m sorry

MAJ TALBOT
What do you have against me

Youre a winker Major You
know the kind of guy who lets
you know you’re his friend with
awink (winks) Hey

Talbot looks

MAJ TALBOT
(laughs)
I’m a winker

ROSS
That’s my take

MAJ TALBOT
I think you don’t like ne
because your father does

self-satisfied

MAJ TALBOT (CONT’D)
Just like he doesn’t like
Banner But that wouldn’t have
anything to do with your fond
regard for him would it

ROSS
Do you know anything about
Banner’s childhood Major Did
you know his father was an
alcoholic who couldn’t held a job

A classic abuser Banner’s mother

died in a domestic dispute which
he witnessed at age 9

MAJ TALBOT
I’m aware of all this So what we
just excuse him It’s alright spy
on your country sell secrets
break the law you had a tough
childhoed I don’t buy that

ROSS
Neither do I I’m just trying
to understand hin

MAJ TALBOT

So am I You read Doc Samsons
file Banner’s a control freak
He turned off his emotions in the
name of science and threw himself
into his work Any Bruce Banner
who resembled a human being with
human emotions died a long time
ago

ROSS
Perfect for military use Just
add funding

MAJ TALBOT
Maybe But Los Osos gave him a
life

If it’s supposed to make us hate Banner it has the
opposite effect We feel sorry

ROSS
Exactly and just like that he
throws it all away

These are two intelligent people

daughter likes hin

Talbot has a sense of humour He flashes a charming grin

takes a bite returns to work

It doesn’t make sense My
blood seems normal in every

band-aid Greases a slide with a drop of blood and slides
a coverlet over it He centers it in the electron
microscope guide He motions Rick over --

That’s it You’re better at
this school stuff than you
thought

RICK JONES
Yeah What’d I say

What triggers the change

RICK JONES
When you got pissed off

Banner is moying quickly now on a creative jag

BANNER
Anger Fear Fight or flight
Emotion Metabolic effects
Elevated blood pressure
Restricted flow

Banner goes to the drug cabinet and finds what he’s
searching for A SMALL VIAL Taps it

BANNER (CONT’D)
Here we go Human adrenaline
from cadavers

Banner flips a tiny vise into place over the slide He
tightens the calibration to hold the slide in place
clamping it over the coverlet --

He takes a titration from the vial and drips it onto the
edge of the coverlet watching through the microscope as he
does --

UNDER THE MICROSCOPE

Regular blood platelets swimming through the plasma From
the edge where the adrenaline was introduced -- coalescing

seeming to appear out of nowhere Large green masses
Gamma-radiated celis

THE CORPUSCLES squeeze as the now-green white cells expand
and swell violently --
BANNER 6 My God

The blood cells swell and strain against the glass
Suddenly the slide CRACKS AND SHATTERS -

BANNER jumps back breathing heavily --

RICK JONES
Doc relax What is it

BANNER
Adrenaline triggers the
change

RICK JONES
Deep breaths come on

Banner tries to fight it --

BANNER
When I get excited it he comes
out I was completely irradiated
The potential energy of that bomb
blast was stored up in the nucleus
of every cell every atom of ny
body Any excitement any emotion
triggers a jump in the subatomic
level releasing the stored
energy I’ve become a kind of
battery Every second my cells
are building up gamma energy and -
as I almost just demonstrated
again - it’s taking less and less
to trip the change

RICK JONES
Like an H-bomb with a hair
trigger

and gets real nervous --

RICK JONES
You don’t understand

RICK JONES
Stay cool mister please he’s
sick

The cop swings the gun toward Rick Rick looks at Banner

BANNER is experiencing stress He grabs his head The cop
swings the gun back --

The first cop returns picks up on his partner’s mood and
pulls his gun too -

Justthen Banner lurches forward collapsing actually
But the cops don’t know that and the second cop’s nerves
get the better of him He FIRES --

Banner is hit high in the arm --

It spins him around and into a tray of equipment crashing
to the floor out of sight trailing blood --

PROF KRIEG
I11 call an ambulance

Krieg exits The cops approach round the equipment
Banner’s foot comes into view Then the LIGHTS start to
FLICKER THE HEARTBEAT rises Banner’s foot splits fine
Italian leather with skin more leathery and green

RICK JONES
You better get out of here

their sound For something so big the Hulk moves
surprisingly fast leaping to the window sill frozen for a
moment like William Blake doing Dante Then the glass
SHATTERS

EXTINT CAR - SAME

Ross Maj Talbot and Capt Siegel in one car In front of
them a string of POLICE CARS SIRENS wailing The
HEADLIGHTS of the lead car suddenly illuminate -

THE HULK Frozen like a deer More like a Sasquatch too
big and bizarre to believe His black-green pupils
contract in an instant in the glare of the lights --

The car plows into the Hulk with a metal-rending CRASH
Totalled Men’s heads spider the windshield like crash-
test dummies as the car goes from 60 to 0 in an instant
In the middle of this there is an animal ROAR ANOTHER
CAR plows into the mess Then a third The rest SCREECH
to stops

THE HULK is unharmed just steps back from the accident A
jumble of broken headlights and light bars play over hin

ROSS is out of car Talbot and Capt Siegel beside her

CAPT SIEGEL
What is that What in God’s name
is that It’s seven feet tall

A lot of law enforcement officials draw a lot of guns The
riot gear comes out as they spread find cover flanking
the Hulk Capt Siegel grabs a megaphone from the car --

CAPT SIEGEL
Hold it You are under arrest
Put your hands in the air

Siegel turns to Ross --
Y

CAPT SIEGEL (CONT’D)
Does it understand english
What am I doing

COPS close in on the Hulk guns pointed The HULK ROARS
and swats at the closest man He knocks the gun out of his
hand which incidently breaks the man’s arm with a loud
SNAP The man collapses screaming with pain
CAPT SIEGEL
Oh shit

MAJ TALBOT
Get those lights over here

Ross takes the megaphone

ROSS
This is agent Ross with the
FBI

THE HULK turns to the sound of Ross’ voice and lets out a
quiet puzzled sound as SPOTLIGHTS light up the street --

A coP
Holy cow the guy’s green

THE HULK His expression is soft almost pleading as he
advances on Ross This throws her

ROSS
Hold it right there
The Hulk doesn’t Ross grabs a gun

ROSS (CONT’D)
Well be forced to fire if you
don’t hold your position

But the Hulk gives no sign he understands Ross raises the
gun She steps back As do the other officers The Hulk
reaches toward her

ROSS AND THE HULK He’s right in her sights But maybe
she recognizes something in the monster a dim humanity -

MAJ TALBOT (0S)
Open fire

A HAIL OF BULLETS before the words are out of his mouth
Everyone fires except Ross

But the damage is done The Hulk ROARS in surprise The
bullets hurt Of more concern they make him angry He’s
still standing the Bullet’s hitting his skin like tire
rubber some bouncing off some impacting with a tiny
THUNK

«

CAPT SIEGEL
Sweet mother of Mary

THE HULK endures He turns to Ross with a puzzled hurt
expression

ROSS
Nol Stop firing

But who can hear her The fusillade continues Guns are
re-loaded The Hulk has had enough He sweeps the nearest
cops aside sends some flying onto the hoods of cars
spidering windshields He BELLOWS and stamps the ground
with a massive foot SPLITTING THE ASPHALT unbalancing a
handful of cops and tilting a cop car into a fissure

THE HULK gathers himself as if about to make a charge --

CAPT SIEGEL
He’s gonna charge

No He hunkers down in a powerful crouch and LEAPS --

The GROUND SHAKES and in an instant he’s gone Talbot
Siegel and the officers look around SILENCE

SUDDENLY A CRASH sixty yards away behind them in the
darkness Everyone turns SPOTLIGHTS follow the sound --

coP
Over there

But only for an instant Another spring and the SOUND of
his landing is another DISTANT THUMP farther away --

CoP
Where did he That way

Another rumble and the Hulk is gone -

ON ROSS AND TALBOT Capt Siegel approaches Ross
holstering his gun

INT GAMMA LAB (LOS OSOS) - NIGHT

The place is buzzing again With some exotic new equipment
and Leder’s re-designs it’s more diverse yet strangely
scattered incomplete a sinister air to the whole
enterprise LAB ANIMALS are being unloaded

Leder works on a remote armature plugged directly into a
computer through a hundred exposed electrode wires The
exo-skeleton of a hand articulates just like a normal hand
Leder puts a brick in it programs it and it closes
popping the brick into dust Beside the hand a leg and a

You like it

Leder moves through the lab stopping to correct everyone
he passes A bee-hive of activity The mercenaries from
the truck are scattered strategically keeping an eye on
things looking out of place in lab coats

Leder stops at a pair of SCIENTISTS we recognize from
Banner’s earlier gamadium experiments reads from a
clipboard --

LEDER
Has the distillation of the
nuclear isomers yielded the
atomic numbers I specified

SCIENTIST
Yes but how did you know it
would work It’s never been
done before

LEDER
Because I ran the experiment up
here

Before I let you idiots try it
down here

Leder jots notes on the clipboard --

As insulting

LEDER (CONT’D)
Not heavy enough Now run it
again using these specs It’s
still of insufficient purity

SCIENTIST
For what

LEDER
Run it again And get me more
animals

as Leder’s tone the scientists obey almost

automatically As if Leder’s will when exercised is too

strong to be

defied Leder rubs his slightly bulging head

in a momentary pain Physically he looks weaker and
weaker Mentally his words turn into the deeds of others

Leder motions to Gus Mary and a couple of the mercs

LEDER
Project New Dawn must go
forward now I need room the
underground access

MARY
Look Leder we’re not scientists
we don‘t know anything about

LEDER
Just do what I tell you

Nearby two SCIENTISTS talk quietly

Leder passes

I’ve never seen anything like
it The man’s brilliant
obsessed Every one of these
is an industry-creating patent

SCIENTIST 2

Yes but who are these outside
consultants I don’t like it

geiger counter to the unbelievable metabolic changes taking
place --

BANNERHULK

HAIR coarsens thinning and re-knitting itself ‘according to
a new set of DNA blueprints Under the skin his SKULL
thickens Stored energy is converted by his Gamma-radiated
cells into raw power --

HIS HANDS broaden and darken as the skin color deepens --

He lunges to his feet thrashing breaking the window
board-ups --

It is these movements that ot
but the overcoat and duster hang together better than
previous wardrobes --

Dr Bruce Banner is gone In his place the unreasoning
brutish HULK He SNARLS defiance --

EXT TENEMENT SAME

The Hulk’s tortured shout echoes like a caged beast Cops
shift in anticipation and --

LEDER smiles A DEEP RUMBLE Something takes out a
structural support and three floors of the building
collapse onto themself in partial demolition Like an
inside job by a wrecking ball

The second floor explodes outward with the force of a
cannon Bricks and cement tumble The Hulk jumps from the
gutted second floor as if twenty feet were two --

The ground shakes when the Hulk lands A ROAR that sounds
like Alone A primal snarl as he sizes up the odds
facing off with about a hundred armed officers --

RICK JONES locks up from the police perimeter and sees the
face-off --

RICK JONES
Uh oh Ladies and gentleman

The Captain relays the command The General turns to Leder

This better work

Leder flips a slim-communications stalk into place in front
of his mouth The back of the transport helicopter opens
revealing --

CYBER-SOLDIERS

You saw the armatures at the lab This is the finished
product Dark malevolent post-punk Four prototypes of
the Leder’s design Computer-assisted strength and

Leder looks confident Whatever he mumbles into his
headset is inaudible but the Cyber-Soldiers respond
instantly -

Seven feet tall taller and more V-shaped than the thick-
bodied Hulk They flank him The Hulk SNORTS unimpressed

CYBER 1 steps up his movements jerky but fast as a though
advancing The Hulk doesn’t wait He throws a double-hand
hammer punch at CYBER 1 --

The futuristic mix of man and machine takes it swaying
backward with the force of the blow but not falling --

The Hulk looks surprised But only for a second Servos
kick in and CYBER 1 raises a leg and thrusts out a kick --

THE HULK takes it in the gut and is lifted off his feet
propelled like a wrecking ball into a building --

HULK sits up can’t believe it He looks at --

LEDER clearly in command Their eyes lock The rest of
the CYBERs advance on Hulk --

The Hulk crouches and runs toward Leder He hits CYBER 1
half-way there catches him low Hulk and CYBER 1 plow
into a police car as cops scatter

The Hulk is up advancing toward Leder again CYBER 1
rises a beat more slowly behind him --

LEDER
Incredible The angrier he
gets the stronger he gets

Leder whispers into his comnunications stalk --

Ross
Don’t You can’t kill him
LEDER
of course not Ms Ross I
want to study hin

RICK JONES tries to fight his way through the police line

RICK JONES
Come on Doc you can whip
these guys

BACK TO SCENE

As Hulk lumbers toward the police line and Leder CYBER 2
makes a grab from behind The Hulk thrashes and tries to
throw him off but the armored pest locks down tight --

CYBER 3 rains a series of blows down on the struggling
Hulk Like a hydraulic drill-press against flesh no
matter how tough Pounding him senseless -

THE HULK ROARS and throws himself backwards into a
building CYBER 2 cushions the blow nicely The Hulk tries
to scrape CYBER 2 off as CYBER 1 rushes toward him --

CYBER 2 loses his grip the Hulk turns and CYBER 1 connects
with CYBER 2 discharging a powerful burst of electricity
frying the man inside CYBER 2 --

LEDER shrugs impressed maybe CYBER 2 is out

RICK JONES quietly celebrates the victory in the midst of a
crowd rooting for the other tean

RICK JONES
Yes

THE HULK advances on Leder Ross and The General

GEN ROSS
This isn’t working

LEDER
Its not intended to It’s a
test

GEN ROSS
For crying out loud he’s got
to be stopped

LEDER
I’ve seen enough

He mumbles into his stalk and CYBER 4 lifts a futuristic-
leoking BAZOOKA to his shoulder --

THE HULK still moving forward Ross reads something in the
Hulk’s face and she steps forward --

GEN ROSS
Betty no

BETTY
Who are you

There is something familiar Does she know The Hulk
stops Cyber 4 aims Leder’s lips move —-

CYBER 4 fires The Hulk is hit dead center in the back
with a souped-up GOO-GUN blast Like a flame-thrower a
thick stream of sticky foam envelops the Hulk expanding on
contact enveloping his arms and legs like tar making
every movement an impossible effort --

Still the Hulk keeps walking struggling inch by inch as
the stuff hardens --

GEN ROSS
What is that stuff

LEDER
Goo Though it’s a bit more
technical than that But now
he’s fighting himself

And winning -

LEDER (CONT’D)
Incredible

The three remaining CYBER-soldiers fire wire-strung darts

into the gooey mass plunging deep until they contact skin
Then they discharge glowing Gammapowered energy sources
like massive tasers into the Hulk

THE HULK looks directly at Betty as he takes the full
awful power of the Leder’s devices He struggles but
cannot move to pull the tasers out His muscles are
locked rigid The effort is almost beyond him but he
utters a strangled plea a word His volce is deep it
sounds like a noise issuing from deep within the earth

HULK
BETY LEAV LONE

His eyes roll back in his head and he collapses --

Radiationsuited TECHNICIANS run forward and douse the Hulk
with buckets of a pink solvent The goo runs off him like
jello that hasn‘t had time to set --

More TECHNICIANS wrap the Hulk’s prone form in ‘cables and
the CYBER-Soldiers lift his massive weight into what looks
like a lead-lined sarcophagus A fast HYDRAULIC HISS as
the lecks seal

NEWSMEN break through police lines hungry for an
exclusive Microphones are stuck in Leder’s face as he
negotiates past the crush of reporters to the helicopter

As he turns from the reporters a single bead of green
sweat trickles down his brow He takes a handkerchief fron
his pocket and mops it Unnoticed by all His skin has a
pasty color to it where the sweat wiped off the make-up

The General and Talbot follow Ross stops then

Impressed stares all around From the men Until --

ROSS
I’m an FBI agent for chrissakes

Rick notices the computer terninals --

RICK JONES
Uh weve still got a problen

THE DETONATION SEQUENCE ticking down

RICK JONES (CONT’D)
Weve got to get to the bunker

DOC SAMSON
It won’t matter if that thing
goes off

Everybody turns to Samson’s voice He’s about six inches
taller square-jawed handsome and his hair has turned green
C

GEN ROSS
Samson

Doc SAMSON
It seems I survived a modest dose

GEN ROSS
There’s eight thousand people
on this base

ROSS
Millions more in the path of
the fallout

boc SAMSON
Our only chance is to stop the bomb

ROSS
But only Leder can disarm it

And he’s not telling

Doc SAMSON
Or Banner

THE HULK stahds there staring uncomprehendingly --
LEDER
Well Banner what’s the genius
think about that

HULK GROWLS at the sound of the name Ross turns to the
Rulk The toughness is gone

Ross
Do you understand

RICK JONES
The Doc’s gone

She refuses to give up There’s a tenderness and a
femininity we haven’t seen She cares for hin

ROSS
No Bruce

The Hulk ROARS again --

RICK JONES
He doesn’t like that nane

ROSS
Bruce listen to me

The memory tortures the brute summons the effort to --

HULK
NO

Looks like he might kill her He turns away To leave

ROSS
Yes A decent man Who
means a great deal to me

He stops and when he turns there’s a single tear running
down the Hulk’s cheek --

HULK
NOT BANNER

The Hulk sits down heavily the room quakes -

ROSS
Yes you are remember

Seeming to shrink as he does so The
patches and waves The massive Gamma-thickened skin
smooths and relaxes Pinkens with a human glow --

And Ross does what no gun or bomb could She brings Banner
back He’s weak as a kitten --

ROSS
Bruce there’s no time

BANNER realizes the situation With a heroic effort of
will he stands goes to a computer terminal to do what he
failed to do the first time All the monitors in the place
show the detonation sequence He plays the keyboard

BANNER
What’s the password Leder

LEDER
You figure it out smart guy

RICK JONES
You idiot Give him the password

LEDER
Or you’ll kill me

Leder laughs weakly He’s on his last legs

LEDER (CONT’D)
This is my last chance Yours
too Banner The chamber can
accomodate two

BANNER looks at him in pity and disgust continues trying
key sequences --

BANNER
I can’t crack this Im going
to try a backdoor to the
operating systen
Leder looks worried But only for a second He was
playing possum AN ALARM SOUNDS Leder smiles --

LEDER
Oops I rewrote the operating
systen

COMPUTER (V0)
Warning Unauthorized security
breach

LEDER
That would be the built-in
protection a virus The systen
will now consume itself resulting
in detonation You see Banner I
hate to lose

Sure enough the screen goes green CIRCUITRY FUSED
DETONATION LOCKED The software eats itself and the
countdown is irreversible

RICK JONES
Tell me you got an answer for
this Doc

Banner tries the keyboard without effect

BANNER
There’s no way to prevent the
core from going critical

ROSS
Are you sure

LEDER
Positive

He’s just too damn smart But Banner realizes something

BANNER
No There’s one way

Banner races to the access tunnel and starts to climb the
ladder to the catwalk and the giant bomb casing beyond
Leder looks puzzled then angry --

LEDER
You fool Self-sacrifice is
beneath you

O

ROSS
What do you mean

LEDER
He’s going to try to manually
dismantle the core The slow
radiation exposure will destroy
him Stop hin

The last ploy of a madman or --

BANNER
He knows it’1l work It’s the
only chance we’ve got and he
aidn’t count on it

Didn‘t count on Banner’s good heart --

DOC SAMSON
Get a suit

BANNER (CONT’D)
No time Hey if anyone can
survive this it’s me

Banner grabs a shielded container and heads across the
catwalk into the access tunnel The rest of them can only
watch Rick puts a hand on Ross’s arm --

RICK JONES
The Doc knows what he’s doing

(quietly)
The Hulk’1l protect hin

LOOKING DOWN INTO THE BOMB CASING

Banner moving down the access tunnel He manually unlocks
the mechanism and drops down into the housing --

INSIDE THE GAMMA BOMB

Big enough to climb inside Like his but different The
grown-up version of a child’s toy Banner is surrounded by
the verdant glow of the outer jacket of radioactive
isotope He’s sweating almost instantly But it’s the
core he wants --

He carefully slides the glowing gamadium-282 cannisters out
of their seatings One by one Triggering periodic
FLASHES of light --

ROSS
What’s going on

Doc SAMSON
Spontaneous fission The
nuclei are unstable
¢)

q)

Banner slides the first cannister into the shielded
container Then the next Slowly Carefully The
FLASHES are coming more often now and he’s getting weaker
with every step --

IN THE LAB - EVERYONE HOLDS THEIR BREATH

RICK JONES
That stuff could kill hin

GEN ROSS
If anyone knows the answer to
that question it’s Banner
That boy’s got a lot of guts

The General puts a comforting hand on his daughters
shoulder

INSIDE THE BOMB Is that the timer ticking down or
Banner’s HEART TH-THUMP TH-THUMP TH-THUMP

ABOVE THE CATWALK A few lights blow --

IN THE LAB THE VIDEO GLITCH runs through the monitors
meaning Banner is discharging Gamma Rays himself now like
a living battery presaging a change Banner pauses --

GLITCH His hands shake as he chambers the last cannister
He grabs the shielded container --

GLITCH He works slowly back up the tunnel towards the
radiation doors He stumbles --

GLITCH GLITCH Every step is a struggle --
Across the catwalk just short of the hatch he collapses
Ross races up there opens the door Banner tumbles out
Samson takes the shielded container Banner is dying but
manages a weak laugh -

BANNER

Finally got rid of that ulcer

She smiles through the emotion --

ROSS

Don’t you leave me

BANNER
All my life I was afraid to
care about anything or
anyone If didn’t care it
couldn’t be taken taken away
from me

ROSS
I’m not going anywhere

Banner smiles filled with the warmth of emotion --

BANNER
I know I’m sorry

He smiles and grabs her hand tightly His eyes close

ROSS
No Don’t leave me Banner
Not again

Ross cries And then a peaceful change washes over Banner
as the Hulk takes his place in Ross’ arms

ROSS
Banner

THE HULK GRUNTS uncomprehendingly and sits up He draws
himself to his feet and pauses for only a second to look at
Betty before he turns away The air is filled with the
possibility of menace --

GEN ROSS

Well do something Stop hin
MAJ TALBOT

With what

Talbot and the General wisely step back Ross follows the
Hulk The Hulk stops and gently pushes her back

ROSS
You have to remember

Almost imperceptibly he shakes his head and keeps walking
past Leder past Doc Samson and the freed prisoners --

ROSS
Bruce please come back

But he doesn’t If the Hulk hears or understands there is
no evidence of it No emotion shows on his face Except
maybe just a hint of regret as he walks out of the lab and
into the night Rick Jones following --

RICK JONES
Hey wait up

FADE OUT
THE END
