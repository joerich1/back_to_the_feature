FADE IN

CLOSE on a Polaroid of a dimly lit COUPLE locked in a sexual
embrace We cannot see their faces

MR BROOKS (VO)
(tortured)
God grant me the Serenity to accept
the things I cannot change

Our view travels sensuously down the Womans naked torso to
find the Mans head buried between her legs

MARSHALL (VO)
Why do you fight it so hard Earl

MR BROOKS (V0O)
Courage to change the things I
can

MARSHALL (VO)
Come on youve been a good boy for
a long time you deserve a little
fun

Our view moves back up to the Womans breasts

DISSOLVE THROUGH
THIS TO

EARL BROOKS reflection in a mirror Earl in his 40s has
on a tuxedo Hes in front of a sink in a Public Bathroom and
hes whispering to his image

MR BROOKS
and Wisdom to know the
difference
Picking up speed against the hunger in his head

MR BROOKS (CONTD)
Living one day at a time Enjoying
one moment at a time Accepting
hardship as a pathway to peace

From far away comes the sound of applause
INT BALLROOM - NIGHT
MEN in tuxedos and WOMEN in gowns

Mr Brooks is seated at one of the front tables with his
wife EMMA also 40s

The audiences hands are coming together for what a MAN at
the microphone has just said

Mr Brooks is smiling but not clapping and although his lips
dont move we can hear

MR BROOKS (VO)

(even faster now)

Taking as He did this sinful
world as it is not as I would have
it Trusting that He will make all
things right if I surrender to His
will That I may be reasonably
happy in this life And supremely
happy with Him forever in the next
Amen

The Man at the microphone raises his arms to quiet the
Audience

MAN
I could go on and on about what a
great guy Earl is how he cuts his
toe nails

Everyone laughs
how he gives freely of his time
and money but lets get Earl up
here to speak for himself Ladies
and Gentlemen I give you a
businessman a philanthropist a
great friend and the Evanston
Chamber of Commerce Man of the
Year Mr Earl Brooks

Mr Brooks kisses Emma stands and after accepting
congratulations along the way arrives at the podium

MR BROOKS
Thank you all very much The first
thing I would like to say is I
dont even know how I cut my toe
nails

Applause and laughter from the Audience

MR BROOKS
Twenty years ago when I started the
Brooks Box Factory I never dreamed
I would one day be standing here

EXT STREET - NIGHT
A silver Lexus LS 430 glides past us

EMMA (VO)
Did you see Sis Wallaces dress

INT LEXUS N NIGHT

Mr Brooks is driving Emma is in the passenger seat Theyre
holding hands

EMMA
You could see her nipples At her
age she should keep those things
hidden

Mr Brooks is only listening to his Wife with one ear and
underneath what she is saying we can barely hear

MR BROOKS (VO)
God grant me the Serenity to
accept
EMMA
The only thing that would have made
this evening more perfect is if
Jane had been here

MR BROOKS
She called She has mid terms
coming up

EMMA
Shes dropping out you know

MR BROOKS
Well see
EMMA
Nothing she does is wrong to you
is it

Mr Brooks doesnt rise to the bait

EMMA
Well she missed a good party

As she continues we look at Mr Brooks and Emmas voice
fades to a murmur

In the back seat a Man leans out from behind Mr Brookss
head This is MARSHALL Hes 50 plus

Emma can neither see nor hear him Marshall exists only in
Mr Brookss mind

MARSHALL
Come on Earl give yourself a
break you know you want to do
this

MR BROOKS
No

MARSHALL
Youre the fucking man of the
year you deserve it Its not
like its not set up You already
know how to by-pass the alarm you
know how to pick the locks
Tonights the perfect night

MR BROOKS
(over his shoulder)
No Marshall I said no

MARSHALL
I heard you Earl but you dont
mean no

Emma feels Mr Brookss distance

EMMA
Whats the matter

Mr Brooks pulls himself back into the moment

MR BROOKS
Nothing

EMMA
You were frowning

MR BROOKS
I was thinking of what I didnt say
in the speech

EMMA
They laughed they were touched I
dont think anyone felt left out

MARSHALL
(from the back seat)
They have their dance class
tonight What if we go by and just
look at them Theres no harm in
just having a look
MR BROOKS

no Marshall

No means

MARSHALL
Please pretty please
MR BROOKS
(to Emma)

The food tonight was very good but
I wasnt crazy about the dessert
Would you like to stop somewhere
and get something sweet

INT ICE CREAM PARLOR N NIGHT

In a booth Mr Brooks and Emma are sharing a Sundae Mr
Brooks steals a look at the Arthur Murray dance class that is
taking place behind the full-length windows fronting the
second floor of the Building across the street

EMMA

Labradors are supposed to be
nice or maybe a rescue mutt

MR BROOKS
The Pounds a pretty sad place if
you want me to Ill go with you

EMMA
Theres an Irish Lab I read about
and I think the breeder is

Mr Brooks turns his attention back to the Dancers and again
Emmas voice fades to a murmur

Both Mr Brooks and Marshall who is seated on the other side
of Emma are focused on one particular COUPLE

The Man and Woman are not great dancers nor are they
especially attractive but Mr Brooks and Marshall are

fascinated with them

Marshall leans forward and looking slyly around Emma at Mr
Brooks

MARSHALL
I bet your dicks getting hard
isnt it just imagining what they
would look like dead

Savoring the ice-cream Mr Brooks nods
EXT BROOKS HOUSE N NIGHT

Two story modern Not ostentatious but the elegance of the
line and the grounds say theres big money here

INT MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Through the door of the DRESSING AREA Emma can be seen
taking off her evening clothes

Hidden by the darkness on the other side of the bed Mr
Brooks is hunched forward on a chair his head in his hands
His bow tie is undone but hes still wearing his Tuxedo In
obvious torment he is whispering to himself

MR BROOKS
I cant do this I cant do
this I cant do this please dont
let me do this God grant me the
Serenity to accept the things I
cannot change

In the DRESSING AREA

Emma is putting on her sleep-wear Mr Brooks steps into the
doorway

MR BROOKS
Im going to stay up a while maybe
go to the studio and play with some
glazes

EMMA
Okay Im going to read If Im not
awake wake me when you come back

Mr Brooks comes forward puts his arms around Emma and hugs
her then easing back kisses her

MR BROOKS
I thought you were wonderful
tonight
EXT THE BROOKS HOUSE N NIGHT

Mr Brooks exits the back door and starts down a path that
leads away from the house

MR BROOKS
(to himself)
Dont do this dont do this
please dont do this dont do
this dont do please dont do
this

He passes through a screen of trees and arrives at a small
beautiful industrial-looking Building

No windows except for a narrow strip on three sides just
under the edge of the roof

Mr Brooks lets himself in with a key
INT BUILDING N NIGHT

Exquisitely unique handmade handglazed bowls vases cups
plates are scattered haphazardly on shelves and tables around
the room

This is Mr Brookss CERAMICS STUDIO

Mr Brooks turns on the big industrial kiln and sets the
temperature then in a series of quick cuts changes out of
his tuxedo into his work clothes which he selects from a
dozen identical pairs of khaki shirts and pants hanging ina
closet

Below the pants and shirts are a dozen pairs of identical
leather work shoes The windbreaker he puts on is also from a
dozen identical windbreakers

He takes a set of car keys off a hook next to a door which
opens into a garage Under the light is an older model non-
descript Toyota

EXT CERAMICS STUDIO N NIGHT

The Toyota backs into an alley and with the garage door
closing behind it pulls away

INT TOYOTA N NIGHT
Marshall is up front with Mr Brooks

MARSHALL
Oh Lordy Earl my boy Ive missed
this We are going to have so much
fun

MR BROOKS
This is the last time Marshall
Understand me The very last time

EXT RESIDENTIAL STREET N NIGHT

A mixture of modest houses and apartment buildings Mr
Brookss Toyota is parked in the semi-dark cast by a tree

We rise over the car over the trees over the houses to the
other side of the block and come down to find Mr Brooks
working the lock on the side door of a small BUNGALOW

He has on surgical gloves

The pick is extracted the handle turned The door opens
Theres a chain

Mr Brooks removes a pair of bent rubber tipped forceps from
a pocket inserts it in the chain pulls the door to gives
the tool a twist and gently pushes the door inward

The chain has been released
INT BUNGALOW N NIGHT

Mr Brooks quietly closes the door and holding his breath
stands very still and listens

Theres a faint indistinct sound coming from the recesses of
the house

Mr Brookss feet glide out of the PANTRY Now coming
slightly behind him is another pair of legs encased in dark
slacks
Move up

In the middle of the KITCHEN
Its the moans of a Couple fuc
he hesitates

the person in the black slacks is Marshall

the sound is now recognizable
king This disturbs Mr Brooks

Marshall leans in and hisses fiercely in his ear

it on me you

want to see what

MARSHALL
Dont you dare qu
piece of shit I
theyre doing
Mr Brookss spine stiffens an

Entering a HALLWAY he reaches
reappears its inside a Ziploc
butt of a silenced pistol

He brings the hand and bag to
Ziplock against his wrist

The two Men arrive at a door t
the sounds of the love-making

Mr Brooks nudges the door wit
he and Marshall to see the Cou

The Man and Woman from the Art
naked on the bed

d hes going forward again
into his jacket When his hand
bag his fingers around the

his mouth and tightens the
hats slightly ajar Behind it
are becoming more intense

h his foot
ple inside

It opens enough for

hur Murray dance class are

As much as Mr Brooks hates himself for it he loves watching

He can now hear his heart beat

He begins to breathe in unison
expression is distant almost c

When the Couple climaxes when

goes blank

On the bed the Woman rolls off

ing in his ears

with the Couple but his
linical
Mr

they come Brookss face

her Partner and the two of

them lie there basking in the afterglow
Behind them Mr Brooks pushes the door fully open and slips
into the ROOM They dont know hes there until he speaks

MR BROOKS
Hello

Both the Man and Woman jump with surprise and look The Woman
screams and scrabbles at the sheet to cover herself

MAN
What the fuck

Then he sees the gun

MAN
Hey man dont

MR BROOKS
(to the Woman)
Be quiet and sit up

In an attempt to get away the Woman pushes herself back
against the wall She cant take her eyes off Mr Brooks and
she cant stop screaming

POP A hole appears above her left eye The impact of Mr
Brookss High Velocity 22 slug bounces her head off the
wall The screaming stops

The Man opens his mouth and begins to shake POP The bullet
through his brain makes him instantly dead and he crumples
onto the Girl

Mr Brooks looks at what hes done His nostrils flare at the
scent of death Then he moves hes got work to do On his
way to the bed the pistol goes into his pocket

MARSHALL (0S)
(barks)
Whoa Earl what the fuck is
this

Mr Brooks snaps a look
The curtains of the bedroom window are open and over half of
the Apartments in a four story Building on the other side of
an alley can see into this room

Most of their windows are dark And theres no one looking
out of the windows that are lit

MARSHALL
These pigs liked to fuck with the
blinds open you should have known
that Earl This is a big mistake
for you Earl

MR BROOKS
(going to the window)
Almost like I want to get caught
huh Marshall

MARSHALL
Well dont fucking do that I
dont think either of us would
enjoy spending the rest of our
lives in jail or a lethal
injection

MR BROOKS
Yes sir

He grabs a side of cloth in either hand and yanks the
curtains closed

cut To

CLOSE on a Polaroid of the dance Couple in a sexual pose The
attitude of the bodies is awkward and very reminiscent of the
ones in the Polaroid we opened the movie with

INT CERAMICS STUDIO N NIGHT

Mr Brooks is kneeling naked in front of the kiln where his
murder clothes are being reduced to ash

Arranged on the floor are Polaroids of the dance Couple in
sexual positions
MR BROOKS
Please forgive me Please forgive
me

As we look closer at the Photographs we realize by a smear of
blood here and there and the distortion of the limbs that
these tableaus were arranged after the Couple was killed

One by one Mr Brooks picks up his souvenirs He lingers
over the last image and from where hes sitting on the edge
of a table

MARSHALL
Dont even think about it You know
the rules

Reluctantly Mr Brooks throws the Polaroids into the fire of
the kiln

MARSHALL
Now go up and make love to your
beautiful wife

He leaves In the kiln the Polaroids burst into flame
EXT MURDER HOUSE N AFTERNOON

The sunlight exposes its charm

If it werent for the Police tape the UNIFORMED OFFICERS

and the PLAINCLOTHES DETECTIVES it looks like it would be a
cool place to live

An OLDER DETECTIVE an African-American comes out on the
porch and calls to two other DETECTIVES who are drinking
coffee on the lawn

OLDER DETECTIVE
Where the fuck is Atwood

YOUNG DETECTIVE
I called ten minutes ago they said
she was on her way
OLDER DETECTIVE
She doesnt get here soon these
bodies wont even be dead anymore

A Uniformed Cop standing guard at the tape

COP
You looking for the lady Cop

OLDER DETECTIVE
Yeah

COP
Shes here Shes been sitting in
her car right over there for the
last half hour

OLDER DETECTIVE
Oh Christ

EXT ATWOODS CAR N AFTERNOON

Special Detective TRACY ATWOOD somewhere in her 30s is
behind the wheel The door is open

By the expression on her face we might guess that Detective
Atwood has simply forgotten to get out of the car

On the seat next to her is a copy of the Chicago Tribune The
headline of a middle article on the first page reads THE
HANGMAN ESCAPES

Move up to Atwoods face The Older Detective followed by the
Younger Detective approaches

OLDER DETECTIVE
You thinking of joining us anytime
soon Atwood

Atwood doesnt look at the Detectives for a long beat and
when she does her expression is not friendly

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
I really hated yesterday Snyder
and then today came along
As she gets out of the car the Men notice the bandages on
her wrists and falling into step with her on the way to the

house

SNYDER (OLDER DETECTIVE)
What happened to your wrists

Atwood holds up her hands to reveal the extent of the

bandages

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
I tried to commit suicide

The Young Detective laughs Atwood whirls on him

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Whats so funny

YOUNG DETECTIVE

Eh I I dont know I heard it
was because you were drunk and got
into a fight with a fish tank

Atwood sticks her finger into the Young Detectives chest

Atwood turns

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Who are you gonna believe Me or
the fucking fish

YOUNG DETECTIVE

Eh you

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Good

and leaves the Men

YOUNG DETECTIVE
(under his breath)
Shes nuts

SNYDER
And rich

They catch up to Atwood who has squatted down to examine the
lock on the front door

SNYDER
There are some scratches in the
side door cylinder Other than that
no signs of forced entry The alarm
was armed and we even had to cut
the security chains to get in

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
(straightens up)
This guy hasnt been active for
over two years

She enters the house
INT MURDER HOUSE N AFTERNOON

From the way Atwood looks at her surroundings as she crosses
the Living Room we get the feel that this Woman misses
nothing

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
we think hes either dead or in
jail on some other charge This is
probably a copycat

Detective Snyder points her down the Hall toward the Bedroom
and follows

SNYDER
Thats why we called you Youre
the God that tells us peons if we
have a simple murder here or
something we can dump on you

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Bite yourself

Atwood arrives in the doorway of the BEDROOM where the
murders took place and stops

The Bodies of the dance Couple are now on the floor The Man
is propped up against the bed in a sitting position The
Woman has her head in the Mans crotch

Almost like Mr Brooks Atwoods nostrils flare but in
Atwoods case its not the scent of death that arouses her
but its like shes searching for the scent of her prey
In a glance she memorizes the Room then steps inside

INT BEDROOM N AFTERNOON

The Crime Scene TECHNICIANS shift to accommodate Atwoods
inspection

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

(indicating the Victims)
He always rearranges the bodies
but this is out of character He
has never left them in such a crude
position Usually its more
romantic with their arms around
each other kissing their mouths
open their tongues touching

SNYDER
So we have a copycat

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Where are the thumbprints

Snyder points to a bare space of wall above the bed Atwood
leans in to look at two bloody thumbprints placed side by
side

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
One his one hers

SNYDER
Thats what it looks like

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Whats that

There are two holes gouged into the plaster of the wall
SNYDER
The bullets went completely through
the victims The killer recovered

the slugs

Atwood unfolds and after another look around the room goes to
the window and cracks the curtains

Theres the four story Apartment Building across the alley
its windows staring down at her

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Were these open or closed when you
got here

SNYDER
Closed

Atwood tries the cord the curtains are stuck

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Hmm

She returns her attention to the murder scene

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
It has never been revealed to the
public that the Thumbprint Killer
retrieves the slugs

SNYDER
So this ones yours

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
I dont fucking need this

She doubles back and cracks the curtains for another look at
the four story Apartment Building

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Have you checked the tenants of
that building

SNYDER
Only a few of them are home they
say they didnt see anything We
checked the whole neighborhood so
far nobody saw a thing

Atwood nods and turns back to the bodies

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Leaving them like this he must
have been angry at them for some
reason

She reaches down and runs a hand over the carpet

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Where would they keep their vacuum
cleaner

A puzzled Snyder follows her out of the room

INT PANTRY N AFTERNOON

Atwood opens a service closet Theres the Vacuum Cleaner

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Ill bet you a hundred bucks
Snyder there is no bag in that
vacuum cleaner

SNYDER
I have no idea what youre looking
for

Atwood unzips the cover There is no bag inside

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
He vacuumed the house and took the
bag

SNYDER
Oh shit That is scary smart

EXT ALLEY N AFTERNOON

Detective Atwood is standing on an empty capped plastic
gallon milk carton looking over the fence into the back yard
of the Murder House Snyder has his hand on her back to
steady her

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Okay

He releases her She hops down and directs her attention at
the four story Apartment Building

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Our best hope is if someone in
there saw something

A MAN comes out from behind the next door fence and strides
purposefully toward them

MAN
Detective Tracy Atwood

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Yes

MAN
This is for you

She accepts the official looking document being offered

MAN
You have been served

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
You fucking asshole Im in the
middle of a fucking murder
investigation

MAN
(backing away)
Hey take it easy lady Im just
the messenger

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Goddamit

SNYDER
What is it

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
My soon to be ex-husbands scumbag
lawyer is trying to show me how
painful she can make my life if I
dont give them what they want
SNYDER
This is not the Doctor

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
The doctor was a couple years ago
This one is my stupid mistake

INT CHURCH HALL N DAY

Others

MR BROOKS

only place that has ever helped me

MR BROOKS

EXT INDUSTRIAL SECTION OF CHICAGO N DAY

A Cab arrives at the Front Entrance of the BROOKS BOX
FACTORY a long three story brick Building

A YOUNG WOMAN 19 is dropped off along with an assortment of
luggage and boxes

INT BROOKS BOX FACTORY N DAY

ts loud We follow a thin piece of cardboard as one machine
deals it off the bottom of a stack into the maw of another
machine

That machine prints one side of the cardboard blue
t is handed off to the third machine which cuts the flaps

The fourth machine folds and glues those flaps and spits the
piece of cardboard out onto a conveyor belt as a box

fq

Wearing safety glasses and ear protectors along with his
business suit Mr Brooks picks up the box and hands it to
one of three similarly attired MEN standing nearby

MR BROOKS
This is not the top of the line or
the bottom but for the money were

As Mr Brooks talks the Men pass the box between them

MR BROOKS
Your packaging is the first
impression your customers will have
of your product

Two snapshot-size PHOTOS taken with a high speed digital
camera One shows the right side of Mr Brookss cheek

He is in no way identifiable but that blur of flesh appears
to be looking at the dead dance Couple

The second Photo is a clear shot of Mr Brooks closing the
curtains with the dead dance Couple behind him

Neither Mr Brookss voice or his face betray the enormity of
what hes looking at

MR BROOKS

A different angle in the same hallway shows Mr Brooks
walking away from us A passing EMPLOYEE crosses him The Men
nod to each other Marshall is nowhere in sight

MR BROOKS (V0O)
I like them I dont want to
lose them

And then were back to the original angle and Marshall is
again in the picture

MR BROOKS
Thats why I didnt want to do
the dance Couple

MARSHALL

INT CONFERENCE ROOM - BROOKS BOX FACTORY N DAY

The Man from the Reception Area is nervously admiring a
display of Mr Brookss ceramic pieces He turns at the sound
of the door opening behind

MR BROOKS
What can I do for you Mr

MAN
Lets say ‘Smith’

MR BROOKS
Okay Mr Smith

Mr Brooks motions him to a seat

MR SMITH (MAN)
(sitting)
Before you get the wrong
impression Mr Brooks Im not
here to shake you down

MR BROOKS
(holding up the photos)
Then these are the only copies of
these photos and you have no
others

MR SMITH
No I have other copies and other
photos and if something were to
happen to me

MR BROOKS
How did you find me Mr Smith
MR SMITH
Youre Man of the Year Mr
Brooks Your picture was in the
paper If it hadnt been I dont
know what I would have done

MR BROOKS
Lucky me What is it that I can
help you with

MR SMITH
Ive been watching that Couple for
months they liked to make love
with the blinds open Sometimes I
would take pictures you know
visual aides for later It was fun
it was a great way to get off I
thought until I saw you kill them
I have to tell you I have never
ever felt a rush like that ever I
know youre the Thumbprint killer
youve done this before What I
want is to go with you the next
time you kill someone And would
like that to be soon

From the end of the table Marshall cackles a laugh

MARSHALL
And you were worried that this was
going to be unpleasant The answer
is simple Just tell him youve
decided never to kill again and
hell go away

MR BROOKS
You enjoy watching me suffer dont
you

MARSHALL

In a word yes

MR BROOKS
Where do you think he has the other
pictures

MARSHALL
He put them in a safety deposit box
but Ill bet the box is at the bank
where he has his checking account
and the key is on his keychain He
really wants to do this hes not
going to go to the cops

Mr Smith who has grown uneasy under Mr Brookss stare
swallows

MR SMITH
So do we have a deal

anything to me Mr Brooks

MR BROOKS
Were both aware of the rules Mr
Smith but I feel I must warn you
If it turns out that you enjoy
killing it can become very
addictive It could ruin your life

MR SMITH
I want to do this

MR BROOKS
(looks at Marshall)
Have I covered everything

MARSHALL
I cant think of anything else

Mr Brooks stands up and opens the door

MR BROOKS
Ill see you tomorrow night Mr
Smith

On his way out Mr Smith nods Mr Brooks closes the door
His chin drops on his chest and he sighs

MR BROOKS
(under his breath)
Please God please help me find a
way not to do this
EXT DOWNTOWN CHICAGO N DAY

Detective Atwood comes out of the CROWD on the sidewalk and
enters a Highrise

INT CONFERENCE ROOM - LAW OFFICES N DAY

Atwood and her ATTORNEYS a gray-haired Man in his 60s and
an Asian Woman about the same age as Atwood are on one side
of the table

JESSE Atwoods soon to be ex-husband very handsome
slightly younger than Atwood and SHEILA his attractive
divorce lawyer sit across from them

ASIAN ATTORNEY
Weve talked to our client and
weve come up with a number that we
feel is more than fair

Atwood is not happy with this The Attorney slides a sheet of
paper to Sheila She turns it over On it is written
750000 -

ASIAN ATTORNEY
We can have a check for that amount
in your office by 6 oclock

SHEILA
We told you at the beginning what
we want and that hasnt changed

GRAY-HAIRED ATTORNEY
You know as well as I do
Counselor if we go to court youre
not going to get a million five

SHEILA
I dont know Lets see

She holds up the front page of the Chicago Tribune THE
HANGMAN ESCAPES story is circled in red

SHEILA

This is the front page of
yesterdays paper

(reads)
Hangman Escapes eh now
here it is after torturing the
young women Thorton Meeks would
hang them in public places - church
steeples balconies Freeway

overpasses Your client captured
Mr Meeks This is just one example
of the cases my client lived
through when he was married to your
client

ASIAN ATTORNEY
Your client knew Detective Atwood
was a homicide detective when he
married her

SHEILA
But he had no idea of the mental
anguish that being in close
proximity to her work would cause
him

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
What about the mental anguish I
went through being in close
proximity to him Whos gonna pay
me for that

ASIAN ATTORNEY
We dont need to get into this
Tracy

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Yes we do I was the one who paid
for everything while we were
married and now Im being asked to
give him a bonus for spending time
with me when Ive already paid for
it in the first place

JESSE
(to Atwood)
Tracy this is not a lot of money
for you and you know how upset I
was when Meeks said that he was
going to escape and he would come
back and kill you

SHEILA

Were quite willing to find out
what a court would think that
mental anguish is worth

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Jesse Darling you know the
best thing that could happen to me
right now That you get hit by a
truck and die

SHEILA

(smiles)

Thats it Mr Vialo and I are
leaving

(she and Jesse stand up)
Youve threatened my client were
going to ask for a restraining
order and well see you in court

The door closes behind them

GRAY-HAIRED ATTORNEY
Thats going to cost you Tracy

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
(standing up)
Fuck it It felt good

INT APARTMENT N NIGHT

Moonlight seeps around the blinds to reveal Mr Smith asleep
in bed

Beyond the open BEDROOM door down the hall is only darkness
until the eruption of illumination from a penlight
momentarily outlines the figure of a Man

Then were looking at what the penlight sees
A keyring Hands in surgical gloves isolate the - safety
deposit key - and press it into a soft wax block where it

leaves its impression The light goes off

In the BEDROOM at the end of the hallway Mr Smith begins to
snore The Figure coasts silently toward the sound

Mr Smiths face is sideways on the pillow The snores anda
little drool burbles out of the corner of his mouth

WHOOMP The impact of something landing on the bed bounces
Mr Smith upright and awake

MR SMITH
Ahhh Ahhh Ahhh

The beam from the penlight hits him in the face He raises
his hands to shield his eyes

MR BROOKS
Dont worry if I were here to kill
you you would already be dead

The penlight leaves Mr Smith and Mr Brooks places it
deliberately under his own chin casting long sinister shadows
up his face Hes sitting on the bed next to Mr Smith

MR BROOKS
After you left today I realized
our friendship was a little one-
sided

(MORE)

MR BROOKS (CONTD)
So when we meet tomorrow night
would you be so kind as to bring
all of the pictures and the memory
card from your camera That way we
can like each other simply for who
we are If you dont show up I
will presume youve gone to the
police and I will kill you Even if
I go to jail because of you
someone will find you wherever you
are and kill you

The penlight goes off Theres total silence
MR SMITH

(squeaks)
Mr Brooks
He squints into the black

MR SMITH
Mr Brooks

Finally he gathers the courage to extend a shaky hand The
bedside lamp goes on The room is empty Cautiously Mr Smith
swings his legs out of bed and stands up

He forces himself to go to the door and from there curls his
arm around the jamb into the darkness

The HALL light is dazzling

A peek into the BATHROOM shows there is nobody there He
continues on into the LIVING ROOM

His camera equipment is on the table The tripod is still set
up There is no sign of Mr Brooks

Mr Smith eyes the front door Its closed and the security
chain is in place

Another quick scan of the room It sure seems that hes
alone

He opens the front door the length of the chain and looks up
and down the hallway Its empty Slowly he closes the door

Standing in the light of his LIVING ROOM Mr Smith is more
scared and strangely more excited than hes ever been in his
life

MR SMITH
Wow

INT HALLWAY N CRIME LAB N AFTERNOON
Atwood is waiting for an elevator It arrives The doors
open The car is empty

INT ELEVATOR N AFTERNOON

Atwood gets in and presses the key for her destination then
slumps into a corner for the ride The doors close The
elevator begins to move

All at once Atwood screams Her pent-up anger and frustration
rip the air and she goes nuts

She punches the wall of the elevator kicks it throws
herself to the other side bangs her head against that wall
punches it kicks it all the while screaming

Then the tears come The screams stop and she settles upright
against the back wall where she strikes her chest repeatedly
with the flat of her closed hand

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
What is wrong with me What is
wrong with me What is wrong with
me

EXT MURDER HOUSE N NIGHT

Its raining The yellow Police tape that still circles the
yard snaps in the wind

Up the driveway out of sight of all the other homes theres
a movement at the side door of the house

A closer inspection reveals that its Detective Atwood From
under her umbrella she studies her surroundings and as if
shes speaking to the killer she speaks to herself

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Did you choose them because of
where they lived or how they looked
or what jobs they had Or did you
just pick them because at the
instant you saw them you had
decided to kill someone The side

door was perfect No one could see
you pick the lock

With a key she lets herself in
EXT STREET N NIGHT

Parked against the curb opposite the driveway of the Murder
House is an old green Pontiac Convertible with the top up

The drivers window is down and from inside a WOMAN late
20s is watching the house

INT MURDER HOUSE N NIGHT

Atwood stops in the PANTRY almost in the exact spot where Mr
Brooks stopped

The quiet is filled by the rain drumming on the roof The
wind rattles the windows

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
How did you know where they were in
the house

She steps into the KITCHEN On the way across she bumps into
a chair

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Its darker tonight than it was on
your night But still how did you
manage not to bump into the
furniture Did you have a little
light That would be too dangerous
Ill bet you were in the house
before

(MORE)

DETECTIVE ATWOOD (CONTD)
So I should ask the neighbors if
they saw a meter reader around the
house or a telephone repairman or
someone from the gas company

These musings take her through the LIVING ROOM to the
entrance of the HALLWAY where she pauses and looks both ways
DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Once again how did you know where
they were Did you check the rooms
before you found them She had his
semen in her vagina they had just
made love did you hear them or was
there a light on

She steps into the HALL

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
And when did you bag the gun
Because even though Im sure youre
an expert at it theres stilla
chance of noise from the plastic

She continues down the HALL to the BEDROOM

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Was the door open or did you have
to open it

She opens the door and goes in

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Were they asleep or awake Was the
light on or did you turn it on
Because I know you you wouldnt
risk a shot in the dark

She turns on the overhead light
DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Too bright What if it wasnt that
light that was on but this one

She turns on a bedside light and goes back to the door and
turns off the overhead

If the dance Couple were on the bed and their blood was not

on the wall the room would look exactly the way it did when
Mr Brooks said hello

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Thats better What thrill do you
get by killing people Is it
sexual is it hate is it power Do
you feel remorse Probably that
part of your brain doesnt exist
Do you have emotions of love or
affection or joy Or have you
learned to fake them so you wont
stand out in a crowd

Shes at the window now feeling the curtains

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
What if these are stuck closed
because you yanked them closed
Which means they were open when you
came into the room

She separates the fabric and looks out the rain-streaked
window at the four story building across the alley There are
lights on in almost all the apartment windows

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
If Mr and Miss Normal made love
with the curtains open and the
lights on someone in that building
noticed them and may have seen you

She allows the fabric to drop back into place and turns to
look at the bed

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Was that what you were angry about

INT APARTMENT BUILDING N NIGHT
Moving slowly across a neutral colored wall

DETECTIVE ATWOOD (0S)
Thank you for your time

A door is closed We come to the corner and are looking down
a HALLWAY at Atwood coming toward us We move to her and
arrive just as she raises her fist to knock

Before she can the door opens and she and Mr Smith who is
on his way out of his Apartment are surprised that the other

one is suddenly there Each one takes a half step back

Phwap The manila envelope that was wedged under Mr Smiths
left arm hits the floor

MR SMITH
Oh You scared me

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Im sorry
(bends down and picks up
the envelope)
I was about to knock Im
Detective Atwood with the Chicago
Police

MR SMITH
(accepting the envelope)
Thank you

Through the open door Atwood can see Mr Smiths camera on a
table and the collapsed tripod leaning against the wall

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Are you a photographer
(glances at her list)
Mr Baffert

MR SMITH
No eh its kind of a hobby I
just started

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
I dont know if youre aware but
there was a murder

MR SMITH
Oh yes in the house across the
alley

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Did you happen to see anything
unusual or suspicious that night
around that house Anything at all

Mr Smith puts on his thinking expression and pauses a little

bit before
MR SMITH
No I wondered that when I heard
what happened but no
(looks at his watch)
Im sorry Im meeting someone and
I dont want to be late

He moves into the Hallway closing the door behind him

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Heres my card if you hear
anything or remember anything

MR SMITH
(taking the card)
I wish I could be of more help but
sorry

Watching him walk away amid the crinkle of his raincoat
Detective Atwood maybe because of her womans intuition or
maybe because shes a good cop wonders what is in that
manila envelope under his arm

The thought is gone almost as soon as it comes and she faces
about to the next door

EXT STREET N NIGHT

Hunched against the rain Mr Smith is acutely aware of the
traffic His eyes strain to see the Occupants of each passing
car He doesnt give a second thought to the older non-
descript Toyota parked against the far curb

INT TOYOTA N NIGHT

Mr Brooks is in the drivers seat Marshall is in the back
Theyre both tracking the progress of Mr Smith

MR BROOKS
He looks clean He looks like hes
alone

MARSHALL

No Im telling you he wants to do
this

MR BROOKS
I guess I should turn around and go
pick him up

MARSHALL
Nah Just honk Maybe hell get
killed crossing the street and save
us the mess of doing it

EXT STREET N NIGHT

Honk Honk Mr Smith looks around Hes not sure that
sound was for him But when the Toyota honks again and
flashes its lights Mr Smith waves and splashes to the
center of the street

Even though he stops to let it pass a car sounds its horn
and swerves to avoid him Mr Smith crosses behind the Toyota
and opens the passenger door

INT TOYOTA N NIGHT

Mr Smith flops into the seat

MR SMITH
Woof Its really coming down out

MR BROOKS

They say itll be sunny tomorrow

Mr Smith fumbles with the buttons and zipper on his
raincoat

MR SMITH
I never trust those guys when they
say its going to be clear it
always rains and when they say its
going to rain its sunny

He comes up with the manila envelope

MR SMITH
Heres what you asked for
Mr Brooks takes it and hefts it

MR BROOKS

MR SMITH
Yeah

MR BROOKS
You and I both know that not all
the pictures are in here and you

MR SMITH
But you understand my position

Mr Brooks favors him with a wolfish smile

MR BROOKS
Yes I do But its my hope that
once you get to know me better
youll feel comfortable in giving
me all that Ive asked for

MR SMITH
That sounds fair Oh I almost
forgot I thought you might be
interested in this

His hand comes forward with a card
MR SMITH
Its the policewoman whos looking
for you

Marshall snaps forward from the back seat

MARSHALL
Wow Weve never known anyone whos

looking for us before

Mr Brooks pinches the rectangle of paper away from Mr Smith
for a closer view

MARSHALL
Weve got to find out everything
there is to know about this woman

MR BROOKS
This is too close Marshall too
damn close

Mr Smith interrupts Mr Brookss focus on Detective Atwoods
card

MR SMITH
So what do we do now Whats the
plan for the evening

Mr Brooks slips the envelope under the seat and starts the
car

MR BROOKS
We drive around until we see
someone we think we might enjoy
killing

MR SMITH
Really Thats it I thought you
might already have someone in mind

MR BROOKS
I dont enjoy this Mr Smith I do
it because Im addicted to it And
before you entered my life I had
vowed I would never kill again So
this is your party you can chose
anyone you want and well do it
together

MR SMITH
Can it be someone I know

MR BROOKS
You never kill someone you know
Thats the easiest way to get
caught

A neutral-colored PICKUP swerves out of the next lane into
Mr Brooks lane

MR SMITH

Mr Brooks is forced to slam on his brakes to avoid running
up the PICKUPS tailpipe

HOONKK Mr Brooks angrily lays on the horn

The brake lights of the PICKUP flash in response causing Mr
Brooks to brake again

MR SMITH

INT INDOOR POOL N NIGHT
The lane lines are in place

Detective Atwood is the only one in the water Up and down
she goes with a long smooth stroke flipping the turns Shes
not swimming for pleasure shes working out

The underwater lights cast rippling shadows on the walls and
ceiling and since they are the only illumination the room
feels spooky

Atwoods fingers touch the wall She raises her head to check
her time then takes off her goggles

Hanging onto the gutter she tries to catch her breath lowers
herself under the surface blows a lungful of bubbles comes
up to face LARRY a Man slightly younger than she is ina
beautiful suit perched on the edge of the deck looking down
at her

He has a dress on a hangar over one shoulder and a pair of
shoes dangling from the fingers of his other hand
DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Hi

LARRY
Hi I brought a dress and a pair of
shoes I thought we could leave
from here

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Great idea

She lifts herself to him and they kiss
INT EXCLUSIVE SUPPER CLUB N NIGHT

Detective Atwood and Larry are at a balcony table overlooking
a well-populated dance floor The Music is 40s and 50s
performed by a live BAND

LARRY
I gave him my drivers license
my student ID he didnt look
anything like me luckily they
never checked

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
I did something like that except I
was the one who took the test It
wasnt math a friend of mine was a
theology major and needed a second
language to get into the Masters
program

LARRY
She started her career in theology
with a lie

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Isnt that what all theology is
based on

LARRY
Did you pass the test

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Oh yeah

LARRY
Dont tell me she ended up as
Mother Teresa or the Pope

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
No she realized very quickly there
wasnt enough money in religion for
her the last I heard shed written
a diet book that was very
successful

LARRY
She stayed in religion

Atwood smiles her fingers find Larrys and they intertwine
The view floats over the balcony

As it slowly drops the PEOPLE on the dance floor Couple by
Couple disappear until there are only three Couples left
one of them is Atwood and Larry Her head is on his shoulder

Its a slow dance

Larry is very good and wherever he leads Atwood easily
follows The lights begin to dim and we move in

Larry touches his lips to Atwoods neck She arches back and
he kisses her neck again and again

His lips move up and find hers and we are now close on the
kiss Gently the lips separate and we slowly retreat

Looking into her eyes Larry traces her lips with a finger
then replaces that finger with his tongue

His lips brush a cheek down her neck to where it meets her
shoulder his teeth close softly on the muscle by now we are
far enough away to realize that Atwood and Larry have no
clothes on and we are

INT HALLWAY - DETECTIVE ATWOODS CONDOMINIUM N NIGHT

Larry nibbles at Atwood collarbone kisses a breast strokes
his hands down her sides She shivers He brushes his lips
back and forth across her stomach and then down to where the
flesh of her belly meets her pubic hair

Shes watching all of this in a mirror on the opposite wall

Then he sinks to his knees and buries his head between her
legs From low in her throat Atwood moans We lose sight of
the Couple as we move around a corner

INT BEDROOM N DETECTIVE ATWOODS CONDOMINIUM - NIGHT

EXT MR BROOKS CERAMICS STUDIO N NIGHT
The rain is muffled by the trees

Move slowly toward the Building then up the side to peek
through the narrow window that circles just below the roof
line

In the center of the room the kiln relieves the darkness
with a yellow red glow whose rim touches a slash of white
light coming from under a door tucked in a corner

INT CERAMICS STUDIO N NIGHT

We creep through the white light across the floor thats
littered with splashes of paint and smears of clay to the
office door and peer under it

In front of us are chair casters and two bare feet and legs

MARSHALL (0S)
I think that was right Go back

MR BROOKS (0S)
Were in

MARSHALL (0S)
With the taxes we pay youd think
they could make it more difficult
to hack into the Police personnel
files

We tip toe under the door
INT OFFICE - CERAMICS STUDIO N NIGHT
Its crammed with file cabinets Sketches for pottery pieces

are taped to the walls along with photos of Mr Brooks Jane
and Emma

Mr Brooks clad only in a T-shirt and underwear is sitting
in front of a computer Marshall dressed as he usually is
is in a chair at his side

They are both staring at the monitor where on one side of the
screen is Detective Atwoods Police ID photo on the other
side of the screen Mr Brooks is scrolling through her
personnel file

MR BROOKS
Huh her fathers Gerald
Atwood why does that ring a bell

MARSHALL
Someone you did business with
someone we killed

MR BROOKS
Not someone we killed MBA
College of William and Mary
shes been a cop for eleven

years Married Doctor Carlson
divorced Dr Carlson married Jesse
Vialo restaurateur separated

from Jesse Vialo sued for support
by Jesse Vialo seeing a shrink
because of Jesse Vialo

MARSHALL
Excellent fitness report though

MR BROOKS
She caught the Hangman the guy
that escaped the other day

MARSHALL
Oooh Shes caught a lot of
people And look here this isnt
the first time shes been hunting
for us

MR BROOKS

I wonder what the deal was with her
and Jesse Vialo

Mr Brooks taps a key that minimizes Atwoods file then drags
it to the right hand corner In the middle of a key stroke it
hits him

MR BROOKS
Ahhhh now I remember Her
father Gerald Atwood never did
business with him but Emma and I
met him a couple times big
political fundraiser He owns or
owned one of the largest insurance
groups in the country and a lot of
other stuff

Tap tap tap Jesse Vialos Drivers license comes up
MR BROOKS

Jesse Vialo Good looking a
little younger than she is

MARSHALL
Younger restaurateur
(snorts)

She married him on the rebound from
the doctor and Ill bet he married
her for her money and her
connections

MR BROOKS
The old man being rich doesnt mean
shes rich Maybe hes one of those
guys who would rather give it to
the Opera than to his kids

MARSHALL
Wouldnt she have to declare any
outside income and holdings to the
Police

MR BROOKS
Hmmm

He restores Atwoods file Tap tap tap tap Stop The Men
study the screen then look at each other

MR BROOKS
The Opera didnt get much

MARSHALL
Why would a woman with her
education and worth 60 plus million
dollars and probably more to come
want to be a cop

MR BROOKS
I like that about her

MARSHALL
Youre such a fucking snob Earl
You like her because shes rich

MR BROOKS
No I like her because she found
something thats hers Its not the
family business And shes good at
it Id like Jane to find something
thats hers and that she could be
good at

MARSHALL
Thats exactly why Atwood scares
the shit out of me Shes a cop who
doesnt need the money and shes
looking for us Thats one fucking
dangerous human being

MR BROOKS
The fact that youre not wrong
doesnt make me admire her any
less

EXT SIDEWALK N MORNING

Atwood strides toward her car The PEDESTRIAN traffic is
light Its too early for the stores to be open

Up ahead a BROWN VAN is idling at the curb the sliding side
door is open Atwood can see inside Empty except for some
furniture blankets

The Person in the Drivers seat turns to look into the back
Its the Woman who was watching Atwood outside the Murder
House Her hands are unseen in leather gloves

She looks up and their eyes meet Two strangers The contact
is instantly broken

Atwood takes a deep breath and smiles After the rain the
air is brisk and clean Its good to be alive

SLAM Atwood is body-checked by a Man who springs out of
the recess of a doorway His arms wrap around her shes
lifted off her feet and the Man throws himself and her into
the Van

INT BROWN VAN - MORNING
Oooff The wind is knocked out of Atwood when she lands left
shoulder first on the furniture blankets the Man on top of

her

The Man is Thorton Meeks the Hangman six feet a solid two
hundred pounds Hes also wearing tight leather gloves

EXT STREET N MORNING
The Brown Van accelerates fast away from the curb
INT BROWN VAN N MORNING
His body crushing hers Meeks kisses Atwoods cheek
MEEKS
Surprise surprise Tracy I told

you I was coming back to get you

He frees his right hand and pulls his gun

MEEKS
I already know where Im gonna hang
you But first Im gonna watch
her
(indicates the Driver)

have some fun with you then
shes gonna watch me have some fun
with you

He kisses her again and puts the gun to Atwoods head

MEEKS
Now dont move

He raises up and straddles her

MEEKS
You know the drill Im gonna put
the cuffs on

With his left hand he fishes a pair of handcuffs from a back
pocket and snaps them on Atwoods right wrist

MEEKS
Now the left

He rolls Atwood on her back and with the chain of the
handcuff pulls her right arm toward her left

All Meeks talk has allowed Atwood to catch her breath and
suddenly she jerks her head up into the gun and screams at
the top of her lungs

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
SHOOT ME

At the same time she pulls hard against the handcuff with her
right wrist A startled Meeks is thrown off balance The gun
comes away from Atwoods head

Her left arm now free Atwood swings her palm with all of her
might into Meeks right ear POP His eardrum breaks

Aaaggh He instinctually reaches to cover the damaged ear
with his gun hand

The Driver doubles around to see whats happening From

outside HOONNNKK The Drivers attention returns to the
road

Atwood swings again This time she snags the barrel of the
gun and using it as a lever bends Meeks hand back on the
wrist

BLAM The gun goes off Neither one of them is hit

At the same time Atwood pulls hard on the handcuff that Meeks
is holding in his left hand and twists into him This
dislodges Meeks and hes off of her

Snarling like animals they fight for the gun

CRACK Atwoods leverage breaks Meeks trigger finger His
grip loosens on the weapon She pulls it out of his hand

A quick push skitters it across the floor It drops through
the open side door into the street

Atwood rolls away and reaches for her ankle gun Now its
Meeks turn A sharp tug on the chain of the handcuff stalls
her motion

He flicks his other arm and a switchblade is delivered into
his right hand Snap The blade comes out Atwood is
reaching again for her ankle gun She sees the flash of metal
and flings her head back

Luckily all she receives is a deep gash above her right eye
Blood immediately begins to cascade over her brow

Meeks grins and gives another sharp tug on the handcuff to
pull Atwood into the range of his knife

With one foot Atwood kicks at him with the other she pushes
off and propels herself backward to grab a handful of the
Drivers hair

Atwoods weight hinges the Drivers head back until shes
looking at the ceiling Her scream is equal parts pain and
surprise

EXT STREET N MORNING

The Brown Van veers into the on-coming traffic The Driver of
the car dead ahead swerves The Van solidly clips the rear of
that car

INT BROWN VAN - MORNING
The sudden deceleration of that impact slingshots Atwood and
Meeks forward She hits the back of the Drivers seat

( )

Meeks has further to go He loses his hold on the handcuffs

and smashes into the passenger seat

Her right hand now free Atwood scratches for the gun on her
hip

EXT STREET N MORNING
Careening across its lane the Van sideswipes a parked car
INT BROWN VAN N MORNING

That impact rips Atwoods hand out of the Drivers hair and
sends her sliding on her knees toward the side door

On her way she unclips her gun and is bringing it out of her
holster when Meeks who has managed to hang onto the passenger
seat sees this and slams a foot into her chest

Atwood is launched backward out the side door

EXT STREET N MORNING

In slow motion Atwood flies through the air while at normal
speed the Van is leaving her behind

SMASH Butt first Atwood hammers into the back window of a
parked car The shattering glass breaks her fall

Groggily she rolls out of the indentation Gun still in hand
and blood covering one side of her face she slides off the
car to stand in the street

The Van is nowhere in sight

INT EMERGENCY ROOM N DAY

Captain Lister is watching a DOCTOR sew up the gash on
Detective Atwoods forehead

to Atwood

SNYDER

Stretching out her arm to return the photos

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

choices

CAPTAIN LISTER
Until Meeks is caught Snyder is

(to Lister)
Hes not part of our team

CAPTAIN LISTER

EXT DRUG STORE PARKING LOT N NIGHT

In the scattering of vehicles Mr Brooks Toyota is hidden in
plain sight in a row of cars

INT TOYOTA N NIGHT
Behind the wheel Mr Brooks is again wearing his Pottery-
Throwing clothes Mr Smith is in the passenger seat and

Marshall is leaning forward from the back

Theyre all focused to varying degrees on the Entrance to the
store Mr Smith raises his watch for a look at the time

MR SMITH
Maybe he went home with someone
else

MR BROOKS

Can you still see his pickup
Mr Smith looks

MR SMITH
Uh huh

MR BROOKS
This is not the kind of guy who
leaves his pickup in an unguarded
Lot overnight
The silence returns

All three Men idly observe an old green Pontiac convertible
with a frayed top and paint peeling come into the Lot and
park two spaces away facing them We saw this car last

watching Atwood from outside the Murder House

The headlights go off

The Drivers door opens The Woman who was with Meeks in the

Van steps out and hurries toward the Drug Store

She of course means nothing to Mr Brooks but in the brief
seconds the domelight is on he catches sight of the Man in

the passenger seat A memory tickles his brain

He turns to Marshall

MR BROOKS
Where do we know that guy from

MARSHALL
You really should pay more
attention to what you read Earl

MR BROOKS
Thats what I have you for
Marshall

MARSHALL

His picture was on the front page

of the paper a couple days ago

because he escaped from jail Hes

the killer they call the Hangman

MR BROOKS
Ahh

MARSHALL
Remember that cop you like Atwood
whos chasing us shes the one who
put him away I think his name is
Thorton Meeks

Mr Brooks cocks his head at the vague outline of Meeks

MR BROOKS
Well well well What would life
be without surprises

Mr Smith who remember cannot hear or see Marshall
straightens up

MR SMITH
There he is

The Man they are waiting for is coming down the steps of the
store On the way to his Pickup he takes off a Managers
smock

MR SMITH
You know whats weird Ill bet he
has all these plans of what hes
going to do tonight and tomorrow
and he doesnt know he will already
be dead and wont be able to do any
of them

Mr Brooks nods absently The Drug Store Manager arrives at
his truck

MR BROOKS

You meet a lot of candidates and
you like some of them and theyre
nice but theyre not right and
then that special one shows up and
your heart beats faster and you
know thats the one The man in the
pickup did not make my heart beat
faster

Okay he did not make your heart
beat faster If not him who

someone in mind

Mr Brooks is in a chair off to one side watching everything
For him the conversation is merely a burble of voices He
studies his daughter while she answers a question

She is unaware of his scrutiny And finally all he can see

Emma takes her Husbands hand and after squeezing it follows
her Daughter On the stairs Jane stops and looks back

MR BROOKS
God help me What do I do

Sitting on the island behind him Marshall waits for Mr
Brooks to gulp the glass dry

MARSHALL
She did it didnt she

MR BROOKS
Yeah Itll take the Cops a week to
ten days to put their case together
and then theyll come back and
arrest her

MARSHALL
What are you going to do

Mr Brooks puts his hands over his eyes and sobs then wiping
away the tears

MR BROOKS
Ive been afraid of this since the
day she was born She has what I
have

MARSHALL
Yes she does But youve always
been smart about it She was
stupid She did it because she got
off on it she did it for fun Why
didnt she think it through A
hatchet And she left it there

MR BROOKS
They were pretty graphic werent

they
MARSHALL
That was to shock her into making a
mistake
( )

MR BROOKS

What does she think I think
Doesnt she remember what she told
me That the BMW was being driven
across country by a friend and now
right in front of me she tells the
Cops it was stolen

MARSHALL
Youve always cleaned up after her
whatever she did all her life

MR BROOKS
If the BMW has anything
incriminating in it I hope it was
stolen or she dropped it at the
bottom of a very deep lake

MARSHALL
Do you think she knows what kind of
trouble shes in

MR BROOKS
I think she thought she had gotten
away with it until the Cops showed
up I should have listened to her
it was there She was telling me
I didnt quit school because I was
pregnant I should have dug
deeper

MARSHALL
And where would you be but at the
exact same place you are now It is
not your fault Earl Part of your
problem with her is that you always
think it is
MR BROOKS
She has what I have Marshall So
on a very basic level it is my
fault

MARSHALL
What are you going to do

MR BROOKS
Maybe the best thing for her would
be to let her go to jail

MARSHALL
And what about her child

MR BROOKS
Emma and I would raise it

MARSHALL
You might be right Earl you might
be Because you know if shes not
stopped shes going to do it
again And if she wants to take
over the box business the next
victim could be you

MR BROOKS
I dont think shed go that far

INT CRIME LAB N DAY

A slide of what looks like enlarged grains of sand among
giant carpet fibers is projected onto a screen

The Lead Crime Lab Technician
SIGY (0S)
We found traces of this in two

places

The slide changes to an overhead schematic showing the
interior of the house where the dance Couple was murdered

Detective Atwood and Detective Snyder are standing with Sigy
watching the presentation Atwood has a bandage covering the
stitches over her eye

SIGY
(with a laser pointer)
Here and here

The red dot indicates an area just outside the Kitchen and
just outside the Bedroom

SIGY
We did an analysis and its made up
of feldspar alumina and kaolin

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Whats that

SIGY
A high fire stoneware clay

SNYDER
Like you make ashtrays and vases
from

SIGY
This is more plates and teacups It
was slightly wet when whoever it
was tracked it into the house and
it stuck to the carpet fibers
Were thinking it was the killer

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
It could have been tracked in by a
friend

SIGY
Thats the thing you see the
friend would have had to have been
there almost at the same time the
killer was Otherwise the samples
would have been dry and the killer
would have vacuumed them up

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Is the clay rare is it difficult

to get

SIGY
You can buy it almost anywhere

SNYDER
Thats not much help Sigy

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
And this is the only incongruity
you were able to find in the whole
house

SIGY
Weve done everything we know how
to do It sure doesnt break the
case wide open does it

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
No Sigy it doesnt It does give
me an excuse to ask someone some
new questions

INT CERAMICS STUDIO N DAY

With a hidden lever Mr Brooks lowers casters under the kiln
and rolls it aside to reveal a Combination Safe imbedded in
the concrete floor

He spins the dial opens the Safe and extracts four quadruple-
pocketed plastic sleeves which he lines up in front of
himself

Each sleeve contains a Drivers License two Credit cards and
cash

The pictures on the Drivers Licenses are of Mr Brooks but
you wouldnt immediately recognize him because of the
disguises

As hes trying to decide which of the four Identities would
be best for what he has in mind Marshall comes forward to
look over his shoulder

MARSHALL
The thing that bothers me about
this besides the fact were not
prepared and a multitude of other
things is what does Mr Smith do
when hes walking west tonight and
you dont show up That little
freak could flip out

Mr Brooks chooses the first sleeve and the third sleeve The
other two go back into the Safe

MR BROOKS
Ill take care of it on the way to
the airport
EXT FIVE STORY GLASS BUILDING N DAY
Its in an Industrial Park
Mr Smith exits one of the doors and continues on into the

Parking Lot to a moderately expensive foreign car sitting in
a space identified by a sign which reads

Mr Baffert

He squeezes the disarm button on his key chain The car
chirps twice and he opens the door Bending his knees to get
in he stops

There is a section of Newspaper wedged in the steering wheel
When his brain unlocks he straightens up and moving only the
top of his body makes a quick recon of the surrounding area

and his back seat

Nothing threatening seen he eases into the seat Slam The
door is closed and locked

INT CAR N DAY

Gingerly Mr Smith removes the Newspaper It folds open On
the first page there are words circled in red

As his eyes dart from one to the other we go in close on the
words and hear Mr Brooks say them as Mr Smith finds them

MR BROOKS (VO)
Not - able - to - meet -

Mr Smith turns the page

MR BROOKS (VO)
- tonight - Do - it - same -

Turns the page

MR BROOKS (VO)
- time - tomorrow —

Turns the page

MR BROOKS
- night - Dont - be - stupid -

Mr Smith refolds the Newspaper and throws it at the
passenger seat

MR SMITH
Fuck you

He inserts the key into the ignition
RAP-RAP Theres a sudden sharp KNOCK on the Drivers
window

Mr Smith levitates off the seat Unable to breathe he
turns

Detective Atwoods face lowers into view

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
You remember me

All Mr Smith can do is nod

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Would you step out of the car
please I want to talk to you

EXT CAR N DAY

Atwood steps back as Mr Smith gets out Behind her
Detective Snyder is standing next to the Drivers door of an
un-marked Police car which has blocked Mr Smith in

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
So Mr Baffert what is that you
have to tell me

MR SMITH
What do you mean I dont have
anything to tell you

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Really Because I was driving
around and I got this sudden
feeling that you had something to
tell me about the murders

MR SMITH
No Nothing

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Thats disappointing Because when
I left you the last time we talked
I felt I had missed a clue that was
right in front of me that would
solve this whole case

MR SMITH
I dont know why you would feel
that

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Didnt you tell me you were an
amateur potter that you made bowls
and vases

MR SMITH
No I said I was an amateur
photographer

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Are you positive Because we found
potters clay on the carpet of the
murder house and I was sure you
said to me that you worked with
clay that you made pots

MR SMITH
No I said my hobby was
photography not pottery

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Maybe that was it The Stewardess
upstairs said the victims kept
their curtains open when they made
love Could I see some of the
pictures you took of that Couple

Mr Smith can only stare at Detective Atwood His Adams
apple moves up and down though he makes no sound Should he
or shouldnt he

Finally he throws his arms up in a shrug but in his half-turn
of indecision he happens to spy the Newspaper he tossed at
the passenger seat of his car

Part of it is draped over the console The red circles around
the words on that page jump out at him
MR BROOKS (VO)
Dont - be - stupid -

Mr Smith returns his attention to Detective Atwood

MR SMITH
You are harassing me Detective
Atwood You know very well Im not
a potter and I dont have any
pictures So my feeling is that
your feeling is wrong and that you
should move your car and let me go
home

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
What is your job here What do you
do

MR SMITH
Im a mechanical engineer

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
You have to be pretty smart for
that dont you

MR SMITH
I guess

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Then be smart Mr Baffert You
lied to me right there at the end
Ill be watching you And when you
want to tell me the truth you know
how to get in touch with me

She gives him a dazzling smile

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
See you later alligator

Atwood walks back to her car and gets in

He takes a sip and resumes his gaze out the window

INT HIGH CEILING BUNGALOW N NIGHT

Its dark Theres barely enough ambient light to see that we
are close on the knob of the Front Door
From outside we hear the muffled sound of a Black and Decker
cordless drill and the knob begins to vibrate Someone is
drilling the lock

The sound stops The knob turns The door opens A flashlight
is shone into our face

UNIFORMED POLICEMAN (0S)
Mr Alvin Griffin this is the
Chicago Police

EXT HIGH CEILING BUNGALOW N NIGHT

From the protection of the doorjamb a very young UNIFORMED
POLICEMAN is the person shining the flashlight into the
house

Hes flanked on either side of the door by Detective Atwood
and Detective Snyder

The Officers flashlight illuminates a short ENTRYWAY with a
HALL immediately off to the left and the LIVING ROOM fading
into darkness straight ahead

UNIFORMED POLICEMAN
(continues)
We have a warrant to search your
home and premises Were coming in

Flashlight in her left hand and the Glock in her right
Detective Atwood is the first one across the threshold

She directs the beam at the wall next to the door finds the
light switch Click Click Click

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Lights dont work

She continues to the Hall The darkness is so oppressive
there it seems that her stream of light must struggle to
pierce it

The Room at the end is the KITCHEN
With Snyder hanging in the Entryway to protect her back
Atwood eases the hand with the flashlight around the corner

The dishwasher the sink the cabinets gleam dully back at
her She steps inside

A debris field of empty pharmaceutical boxes and vials trails
away from the Refrigerator

Her flashlight sweeps the rest of the Room Beyond an open
countertop in the DINING AREA the light blurs past an oval
of white and then comes back

Its the face of a WOMAN
Careful of the litter Atwood moves forward until she can see
that the Woman is sitting in a chair at the far end of the

dining table

Her throat has been cut Her head is being held upright by
her hair which is taped to the back of the chair

She has a pen taped between her fingers but the Appointment
Book in front of her is drenched in blood

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
(calls to the darkness in
back of her)
We have a dead woman in here

A light and footsteps hurry toward her from the LIVING ROOM
Atwood swings her light at them

SNYDER
Hey

He squints and turns away

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
I thought you were behind me

SNYDER
The living room is clean

Atwood swings her light back onto the dead Woman The
combined illumination of the flashlights cause the support
joists twelve feet up to throw eerie shadows onto the open
ceiling

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Snyder meet Mona

The Uniformed Policeman comes up beside Atwood

UNIFORMED POLICEMAN
I called it in

The smell of blood and the sight of the carnage is too much
for him His gorge rises and he gags

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Do that outside

The Officer doesnt have to be told twice

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
(to Snyder re the body)
Meeks did this

SNYDER
I thought Meeks hung people

Atwood retraces her steps in the Kitchen

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Meeks is a steroid freak This
Refrigerator was always full of
steroids Mona was Alvin Griffins
niece receptionist lover and
keeper of the keys

She focuses her flashlight on an open padlock dangling from a
steel band that runs around the Refrigerator With the barrel
of the Glock she opens the door

The only edibles inside are a tomato half a loaf of bread a
package of hotdogs and some part of a chicken in a KFC box
The rest of the space is vacant

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Well the steroids are certainly
gone

SNYDER
You think Meeks has Alvin with him

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Meeks thinks Alvin turned him in

She shuts the Refrigerator

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Lets go see whats in the rest of
the house

cut To

Atwood and her flashlight pass us Three feet to her right
and slightly behind is Snyder and his flashlight

The two Detectives are leaving the Living Room and entering
the HALL toward the bedrooms The ceiling is low here and it
feels very claustrophobic

Ahead is a Door painted red

But before they get to it theres a Room on the right
Snyder shines his light in

ts a BATHROOM The shower curtain is open Nobody in the
tub

The Door ahead is waiting but theres another Door on the
right Snyder shines his light in

This one is a Treatment Room with a Therapy table and shelves
of oils and unguents

-

heyve come to the red Door Atwood will open this one

She turns the knob and pushes The Door is stuck She and
Snyder exchange a look

Snyder shuffles back half a step and flattens himself against
the wall He shuts off his flashlight

Atwood takes a deep breath levers her weight against the
door and pushes
Theres a sudden Snap Then the door swings freely open The
beam of Atwoods flashlight reveals a large room containing a
bed a dresser a

CREEEKKK The sound is coming from up in the rafters
Atwood whips her flashlight in that direction

For an instant the beam catches a piece of a large shape
falling fast right at her

Then its lost in the darkness and then picked up again in
the reflected light in the Hall The shape is a naked Man

WHACK The Man nails Atwood in the shoulder BANG Her gun
goes off She bounces into the wall and onto her ass

Barely slowed the Man continues in an upward arc His feet
and knees slam into the ceiling Plaster dust rains

The Man swings back past Snyder Hes lost in the darkness
again Then he swings back into the light and comes to a stop
just inside the bedroom Door

The Man is hanging from a rope around his neck Hes dead
His Body is festooned with syringes stuck into his bare
flesh

In fact two of the needles hold a sheet of paper to the Mans
chest Printed on the paper in big black letters are the
words

A Man comes out of the Hallway The Living Room light goes
on
The Man is Jesse Detective Atwoods estranged husband
He opens the Front Door

The Woman who comes in is Sheila his divorce lawyer

They kiss tongues His hands brush over her breasts He
begins to unbutton her blouse The kiss breaks As he
continues unbuttoning

SHEILA
I called your wifes lawyer
Theyre thinking about the five
million dollars

Jesse opens the blouse and looks at the breasts under the
bra

JESSE
Realistically how much do you think
we can get

Sheila gives him a quick kiss and moves on into the LIVING
ROOM where she drops her briefcase on the couch

SHEILA
If we go to court best case two
if she wants to settle best case
three but I would be happy with
two seven

Backlit by the Fireplace Jesse kisses her again

From the KITCHEN Mr Brooks and Mr Smith watch Jesse unzip
Sheilas slacks and dropping to his knees peel them off her
legs

She steps out of them He kisses the inside of her thighs
her crotch then standing up

JESSE
Ill be right back
On his way out of the LIVING ROOM

JESSE
I think we should hold firm for
three

He shuts off the light In the glow of the Fireplace Sheila
removes her jacket

SHEILA
Lets not be piggish two five two
seven would be a good deal

The TV goes silent Jesse returns with a partially full
glass of Champagne

He hands Sheila a glass from a side table takes a bottle out
of an ice bucket and as he fills her glass

SHEILA
(teasing)
Youve already had half a bottle

JESSE
Youre late if we want it theres
more
They clink glasses
SHEILA
To us
JESSE

To three million dollars

SHEILA
(after a sip)
We have to do this fast because
remember Marie is meeting us here

JESSE
We could ask her to join us

SHEILA
Not funny
JESSE
(undoing the front of her
bra)
I wasnt trying to be

She bops him playfully He bends and slips a nipple into his
mouth Sheila bites her lip and moans

In the KITCHEN Mr Smith shifts around for a better view
The floor under him CRREEEKKS

In the LIVING ROOM both Sheila and Jesse react to the sound

SHEILA
Are we alone

JESSE
Yeah

Mr Brooks seems to appear magically out of the darkened
Kitchen with his gun raised Hes followed by Mr Smith
Sheila opens her mouth to scream

MR BROOKS
Dont do that

INT MR SMITHS APARTMENT BUILDING N NIGHT
Detective Atwood hurries down the HALL and out of breath
stops in front of Mr Smiths door She raps sharply Waits a

bare three seconds and raps again

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Mr Baffert Mr Baffert

The door of the Apartment behind her opens and an OLDER WOMAN
sticks her head out

OLDER WOMAN

Atwood shows her badge
DETECTIVE ATWOOD

OLDER WOMAN
He skipped out I heard him leave

later there were Movers here Musta

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Thank you

As the Old Lady watches Atwood tries the knob Its
unlocked She pushes the door open

The HALLWAY and LIVING ROOM she can see are completely empty
Furniture TV camera equipment art gone

OLDER WOMAN
I told you

INT MR SMITHS APARTMENT N NIGHT
On her way in Atwood draws her gun

Keeping close to the walls she audits the KITCHEN All the
Cabinet doors are open Dishes pots and pans cutlery gone

She moves on to the BATHROOM Soap shampoo toilet paper
toothpaste toothbrushes towels washcloths the contents of
the Medicine Cabinet gone

She moves on to the BEDROOM Bed night table lamps TV
computer gone Clothes closets empty of everything

She looks around Mr Smiths entire Apartment has been
stripped absolutely clean except

theres a crumpled piece of paper in the far corner of
the Bedroom

Atwood goes over and gets down on one knee With her fingers
pulling at the corners she is able to straighten the paper
enough to make out that its a work order from a Moving
company

Reading it with the paper pinched between thumb and
forefinger of her left hand Atwood rises Theres the
silhouette of a Man in the doorway behind her

MAN
Obviously Bafferts gone

Atwood whirls gun up She sees that its Snyder

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
(overlapping)
Goddamit Snyder Knoc

SNYDER
I wasnt able to get the search
warrant

DETECTIVE ATWOOD

We may have gotten lucky

(holding up the paper)
This is the Moving Companys work
order and

(points) )

it looks like this is the
address where theyre taking
Bafferts stuff

SNYDER
Where were you when you called me

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
At home in bed

SNYDER
Can you prove that

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
I was home in bed why should I
have to prove that

SNYDER
Your husband Jesse and his lawyer
were killed tonight

Atwood slowly lowers her head and fixes her eyes on the floor
in stunned silence
SNYDER
It looks like the Thumbprint
Killer Ive been ordered to bring
you in for questioning

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Why I didnt want Jesse dead I
loved him I hated what he was
doing to me

SNYDER
Its on record you said youd like
him dead and who better to fake a
Thumbprint killing than you

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
You cant actually believe I would
do that

SNYDER
If our jobs have taught us
anything Tracy is that people do
strange things They just want to
ask you some questions

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
I will be happy to answer any
questions after we check out this
address

Atwood goes to leave the room Snyder blocks her way

SNYDER
I have to take you in Tracy

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
(waves the paper)
This is the answer to the
Thumbprint Killer Snyder and this
is where Im going and youre not
going to stop me

SNYDER
Dont make me cuff you Tracy
because I will if I have to
Atwood smiles winningly

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
I believe you would

SNYDER
(smiles back)
You can count on it

Snyder never sees it coming WHACK Atwoods right cross
nails him exactly where the jaw meets the neck and down he

goes on his ass

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
(standing over him)
It would be nice if you could come
with me but if you do and it goes
bad theyll burn your ass So this
never happened

EXT FREEWAY N NIGHT
Mr Brooks car speeds under an overpass
INT MR BROOKS CAR N NIGHT

MR SMITH
That was great It was fantastic
It was everything I hoped it would
be Thank you

MR BROOKS
Youre welcome

In the back seat

MARSHALL
Here comes the gun

Without taking his eyes off the road
MR BROOKS
Yup

Mr Smith slides a pistol from under his jacket and points it
at Mr Brooks

MR BROOKS
(feigns surprise)
What are you doing

MR SMITH
Youre smart enough to figure that
out Mr Brooks

MR BROOKS
Well were going sixty five miles
an hour Mr Smith if you shoot me
now theres a good chance well
both die

MR SMITH
Not now Take the next off ramp

MR BROOKS
That wouldnt be very smart of me
would it

He accelerates around a truck into the Fastlane Mr Smith
can see the Exit coming up its quickly left behind

MR BROOKS

(matter of fact)
Think about this You pissed
yourself back there you left your
DNA at the scene of a double
homicide and theres nothing to
indicate that I was ever there If
the Cops do an analysis of that
urine and they will youre the
Thumbprint Killer

MR SMITH
(smug)
No I still have pictures of you
doing the first murder

Mr Brooks smiles a knowing smile Beyond him on the other

side of the Divider

direction

MR BROOKS
Yes But what were you doing at the
second murder

Mr Smith doesnt have an answer for that

MR BROOKS
Let me help you with a thought You
say I forced you to come along and
if Im not here or more
specifically my body is not here to
say different you might have a
chance to beat the rap Now youre
probably asking yourself why I
would help you Im tired Mr
Smith Im tired of killing But
Im an addict I cant quit Ive
tried I cant do it on my own So
Ill let you kill me but I want you
to do it smart in a way that I
disappear and my family never knows
what I was

MR SMITH

How do I do that

MR BROOKS

Theres a cemetery I know about We
find an open grave you shoot me I
fall in the grave you shovel in
just enough earth to cover me
tomorrow a casket is lowered onto
me and Ive disappeared Its a
good plan What do you say

MR SMITH

Why should I trust you

MR BROOKS

cars are zipping by in the opposite

You dont have to trust me Youre
the man holding the gun you saw me
put mine in the trunk

MR SMITH
I dont know You really want me to
kill you
MR BROOKS
Yes
MR SMITH
Okay But any sudden moves and

youre dead on the spot and Ill
make sure your family knows what
you are

MR BROOKS

Atwood crosses to the elevator She pushes the call button
With an arthritic rattle the door opens

INT ELEVATOR N NIGHT

Atwood selects the 5th Floor Creek Clatter Clank the
door closes and after a stuttering liftoff the car begins its
ascent The overhead light flickers on and off Atwood looks
up at it
EXT SIDEWALK N NIGHT

Mr Brooks leads Mr Smith across a street to a pedestrian
gate set in a high wall

Through the bars of the gate we can see a Cemetery bathed in
moonlight

Mr Brooks reaches into his pocket Mr Smith tightens his
grip on the gun

MR SMITH
Uh uh take your hand out real

Mr Brooks does as hes told A key dangles from his fingers

MR BROOKS

MR SMITH
What are you doing with a key toa

MR SMITH

Why do you own a cemetery

Mr Brooks unlocks the gate and preceding Mr Smith goes
inside

MR BROOKS

cemeteries are pretty safe

He locks the gate and handing the key to Mr Smith

MR BROOKS
Youll need this to get out Now
there should be an open grave
around here somewhere Lets see if
we can find it

He produces a small flashlight from his pocket and off they
go

INT OLD DECO BUILDING N NIGHT

Repeating their arthritic performance the elevator doors
open Atwood steps out into a wide sporadically lit HALLWAY

Peering at the numbers Atwood goes to her Left

In the middle of the Hall behind her a Couple exits a Room
and drifts to the other side of the Hall on their way to the
elevator

Atwood re-checks the number on the Moving Companys Work
Order - 517 shes going the wrong way She turns around

Now Atwood and the Couple are walking toward each other on
opposite sides of the Hall

Atwood steps into an area of light

The reflection off her face catches the attention of the Man
who is wearing a wide brimmed hat He lifts his head

Its Thorton Meeks The Woman with him was the Driver of the
Van Shes wearing a watchcap

Meeks gently takes his Companions arm They stop Her eyes
go to where hes looking and then back to his At some
unspoken signal they both draw their guns

Intent on finding 517 and Baffert the Couple hasnt
registered on Atwoods radar

BANG TWOCK A chunk of plaster blows off the wall next to
her head Startled Atwood winces away BANG The Woman
fires The slug explodes the plaster on the other side of
Atwoods head

Now Atwood is turning toward them gun in hand

Meeks fires The bullet passes through Atwoods jacket

Instinctively Atwood assumes a classic duelists pose
offering the smallest target possible Calmly she squeezes
off her first shot

The plaster explodes from the wall above Meeks head The
Woman fires

A hole appears in Atwoods sleeve Atwood pulls the trigger
again

SMACK The Woman screams and falls back into Meeks a bullet
in her hip Atwoods third shot takes the hat off Meeks head
She now realizes who her attackers are

DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Meeks

Dragging the Woman in the direction of the stairs BANG
Meeks fires Maybe its his broken trigger finger that
affects his aim The shots miss BANG BANG The Woman fires

Atwoods next two shots miss
Meeks and the Woman arrive at the stairs and before rounding
the corner BANG BANG BANG fire at Atwood who is now

moving deliberately at them

Atwood doesnt try and dodge the bullets or flinch away from
them and her shots are unhurried

The next one catches the Woman in the side The one after
that nails Meeks in the left shoulder Hes spun into the
Woman

INT STAIRS - OLD DECO BUILDING N NIGHT

Leaning on each other Meeks and the Woman lurch down the worn
marble steps

INT HALLWAY N OLD DECO BUILDING - NIGHT

Atwood reaches the stairs and cheats a look around the
corner BANG BANG BANG From the landing below Meeks and
the Woman fire
Atwood steps out from behind the wall and shoulders square
shoots Another sidestep This shot shatters Meeks knee He
bellows in pain

Moving to the side again Atwood shoots But Meeks knee has
collapsed and he and the Woman are already tumbling down the
next set of steps Atwood waits Theres silence then the
murmur of voices

MEEKS
(calls out)
Atwood
DETECTIVE ATWOOD
Yeah

MEEKS
Come on down theres something I
want to show you

INT STAIRS - OLD DECO BUILDING N NIGHT

Gun at the ready Atwood edges her way downward At about the
tenth step she is able to lean over and look through the
banisters

Meeks and the Woman are propping themselves up against the
wall on the LANDING below Both of them still have their

guns

The moment Meeks eyes meet Atwoods he puts his gun to the
Woman heads BANG

Atwood sucks in her breath
Meeks puts the gun to his temple BANG

Atwood clasps a hand to her mouth and exhales in ragged
gulps

EXT CEMETERY N NIGHT

The finger of light from Mr Brooks handtorch discovers a
freshly dug GRAVE

MR BROOKS
There we are Now if I stand
here

He positions himself at one end of the Grave

MR BROOKS
and you stand there not too
far away and you shoot me I should
fall straight back into the hole

MR SMITH
You dont think I have the guts to
do this do you

MR BROOKS
Im hoping you do

Mr Brooks shuts off his light and straightens up

MR BROOKS
Okay lets get this over with

Mr Smith raises his gun and points it at Mr Brookss head
He hesitates

MR BROOKS
Ill close my eyes

He does Mr Smith pulls the trigger
Click

Mr Smith looks in horror at the malfunctioning gun Mr
Brooks opens his eyes Mr Smith aims the gun again

Click Click

MR BROOKS
Im sorry

As he talks he counters around until Mr Smith is the one
with his back to the open Grave

MR BROOKS
I really did want you to kill me
But in case at the last minute I
changed my mind I returned to your
apartment and bent the firing pin
on your gun

He wrenches the shovel out of a mound of waiting earth Mr
Smith tries to fire the gun at Mr Brooks again

CLICK CLICK

MR BROOKS
In fact I even brought another gun
for you so you could finish me if I
had decided to go through with it

He opens his jacket and shows Mr Smith the gun

MR BROOKS
Unfortunately for you my daughter
is pregnant and just before you
pulled the trigger I realized how
much I want to see the end to that
story

MR SMITH
(dry mouth)
If you do anything to me if you
touch one hair on my head the
Police will find the pictures of
you killing that Couple

MR BROOKS
The contents of your safety deposit
box Mr Smith have vanished

Without warning Mr Brooks swings the shovel The force of
the blow breaks Mr Smiths left arm He howls

The next blow comes almost immediately It smashes into the
left side of Mr Smiths head
The screams stop and a misfiring set of neurons causes Mr
Smith to stand up straight and wobbling look directly at Mr
Brooks

The blood streaming down his face is black in the moonlight

Mr Brooks takes a step to the side cocks his wrists and
swings again His full weight is behind this one

The blade of the shovel strikes Mr Smith in the throat very
nearly taking off his head The flesh that was once Mr Smith
falls to the ground

MR BROOKS
(looking down at the
corpse)

Before I was the Thumbprint Killer
Mr Smith I killed a lot of people
in a lot of different ways

His lips have just brushed her flesh when she twists
violently under him and stabs upward with a pair of scissors
The blades are driven deep into his throat Mr Brooks jerks
back the milk flies out of his hand

MR BROOKS
Agghhh Agghhh

He grabs at the handle of the scissors but his blood makes
them too slippery He cant pull them out

Taking his hand she lies back down After a moment Mr
Brooks turns over on his side and looks directly at us His
lips begin to move but we cant hear what hes saying so we
move in on his face Its not until it fills our view that we
can hear the words

MR BROOKS
that I may be reasonably happy
in this life And supremely happy

with Him forever in the next Amen

God grant me the Serenity to
accept

FADE TO BLACK
