INT BEDROOM - DAY
LYNN asleep squirms on the bed Shes early thirties very
pretty thin-bodied She MUMBLES in discomfort

IN HER DREAM

is A YOUNG GIRL in the back seat of a station wagon She
plays with a Barbie shows it toward CAMERA at the people OS

Someone SHOUTS high-pitched but distorted in a dream-like
fashion

WOMAN
Henry watch out--

The young girls eyes move up from her Barbie toward the
front of the car--slow too slow

EVERYTHING SPEEDS UP the frame shaking like an epileptic
suddenly got hold of the camera

Only a half-second has passed but the young girl is now
lying sideways on the back seat and her forehead is smeared
with blood

She sits up slowly dazed Whatever she sees in the front
seat disturbs her Her lip begins to shake tears welling in
her eyes

Something pops into her peripheral vision She turns

A CLOWN has appeared in the window next to her He SHOUTS
something unintelligible to her and then RIPS HIS CLOWN FACE
OFF to reveal a bloody skull--

The little girl SCREAMS--

--and Lynn bolts upright on her bed screaming She stops
immediately as she realizes where she is but it takes her a
moment to calm down

She turns to the clock--its 538

LYNN
Shit

She jumps up and heads for the shower

INT RESTAURANT - EVENING

Small neighborhood diner Wooden chairs and small tables
Lynn rushes in and spots JULIE sitting alone She rushes over

to join her friend

LYNN
I am so sorry--

JULIE
(friendly ribbing)
Sure whatever it is is so
important that you dont want to
tell me on the phone but its not
so important you cant be--
(checks watch)
--a half hour late

LYNN
I fell asleep--

JULIE
(pointing at an empty
plate)
Look I finished all the chicken
fingers Im going to have to go
to the bathroom and make myself
throw up

Lynn smirks at her friend and sits down

LYNN
I need a drink

She motions for the waitress and orders a glass of red wine

JULIE
So spill

LYNN
(swallows takes a
breath)
Im getting a divorce Julie

JULIE
Shut up

She sees that Lynns not kidding and her smiles lowers like
a draw-bridge

JULIE
What Since when

LYNN
Things have been bad forabout
a year now I guess things have
never been that great

JULIE
WellI justwhy didnt you
tell me

LYNN

You knowyoure--

JULIE
Dont even Im your friend first
Manager second

LYNN

I thought we could work it out
Bert kept making promises and I
kept waiting for him to keep them
Guess what I just found out

(doesnt give her a

chance)
His ex-wifes name is still on the
deed to the house The house Im
living in He said as soon as I
sold my house and moved in hed
have it taken off And you know
how I found out her names still
on it

Julie shakes her head

LYNN
The internet I had to find out on
the goddamn internet

She realizes her voice has started to rise in volume so she
takes a sip of her recently-delivered wine and calms herself

LYNN
I dont know if that was the final
straw It was everything Julie
I dont know anything about him
I dont know how much money he
makes because he didnt want us to
have a joint checking account He
always says hes working late at
night but he wont give me a
number to call other than his cel
phone And that placeit gives
me the creeps

JULIE
Its a sanitarium They do that

LYNN
(shrugs moot point)
I told him I was leaving and that
I was taking Nicky He hit me

Julie is shocked

JULIE
Hehit you

LYNN
(nods)
I was packing some things I said
I was taking Nicky and Id be
filing for a divorce He hit me in
the back of the head

JULIE
Did you call the police

LYNN
No I just wanted to get out of
there That was a month ago

JULIE
You separated a month ago and
didnt tell me

LYNN
I didnt want to bother you what
with all the stuff youve already
got on your plate

She stops as she sees the look on Julies face How
Ridiculous

JULIE
So what are you going to do

LYNN
Get the divorce Once I get full
custody of Nicky Ill start
trying to reassemble whats left
of my life In California

JULIE
Youre going to move

LYNN
I told Phillip yesterday I didnt
tell him why

JULIE
Howd he take it

LYNN
He was shocked you know at
first But he was very supportive
as always

Julie pulls out her cel phone and starts dialing
JULIE
Okay the first thing Im going to
do is cancel the exhibit tomorrow

night--

LYNN
Nononononono please Julie

Julie reluctantly hangs up
LYNN
Youve worked so hard and to tell
you the truth itll be good to
meet some new people Take my mind
off

JULIE
Lynn Well just postpone it I
dont think its a good idea for
you to be doing an exhibit when
youve got this much on your mind

LYNN
Itll be good No great

JULIE
You sure Really sure

LYNN
Really

JULIE
Where are you staying

LYNN
A friend of mine is out of the
country for a couple months She
said I could stay at her house
until I find someplace of my own

JULIE
What about Nicholas

LYNN
Every other day The lawyers had
a temporary agreement drawn up

JULIE
In this state youll have no
trouble getting sole custody

LYNN
(nods)
Im not worried about that Its
justthis cant be my life
Julie I cant be a divorced
mother I just I cant

JULIE
People change Lynn

LYNN

(wistful)

I dont think I ever really knew
him in the first place

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT
The moon casts a faint light through the window Lynn is
asleep in her bed this time without the nightmares

OUR VIEW

looks down upon her and for a moment theres the impression
that someone is in the bedroom standing over her But then we

MOVE slowly across the bed toward the window passing the
nightlight plugged into the wall panel right up to the
window and

THROUGH IT

into the dark night We get a nice birds eye view of the
street

Pools of black shadow lie everywhere The houses along the
street are all dark grey shapes set against a starless sky
Each house appears very middle-class suburban

All is quiet Still

Across the street from Lynns SOMETHING MOVES FROM UNDER THE
SHADOW OF A TREE

Still hidden in the darkness under the leaves its
impossible to tell what it is Then THE CLOWN moves into the
light and we can see hes got some sort of bag in his hand
The streetlight above catches him in total silhouette so
its impossible to tell much about him

And yet theres something definitely sinister about him Is
it the peculiar sight of a clown standing in a deserted
street in the dead of night Or something else

The clown scans the houses across the street and his gaze
stops at the house two doors up from Lynn

He turns to look directly at Lynns house and makes a
shrugging motion very much like What can I do My hands

are tied

He moves across the street taking a new grip on whatevers
in the bag and the bag falls into the street

He holds a giant axe Even in the dim light the silver axe-
blade gleams like mercury

Silently the house awaits his entrance Taking his time he
moves toward the door

EXT HOUSE - DAY

Lynn rushes out of her house clearly late for something She
stops in confusion as she sees five cop cars and an ambulance
in front of the house two doors down

A good bunch of the neighbors--moms and kids--stand about in
groups pointing and asking questions Lynn goes over to a
neighbor GALE a chubby motherly type whos shaking her head
without realizing it

LYNN
Excuse meIm house-sitting for
Margaret Could you tell me whats
going on

GALE
(tsks)
Oh its just awful If were not
safe here where on earth can we
possibly move to

She tsks again but otherwise isnt forthcoming

LYNN
Do you know what happened

GALE
The Olsons All of them Killed
while they slept

LYNN
Killed

GALE
Butchered from what I hear
(off Lynns look)
I know How could something like
that happen here While we slept
This is a nice neighborhood

LYNN
My god

She breaks it off and shakes her head

DETECTIVE PETERS a young guy who looks more like a rock star
incognito wanders over with a pad of paper

DETECTIVE PETERS
Morning folks You all know the
Olsons

GALE
Of course Who are you

DETECTIVE PETERS
Sorry
(flashes the badge)
Detective Peters Homicide of
course Either of you happen to
hear or see anything unusual last
night

GALE

Why yes
(Peters is interested)

There was a carfull of raving
psychopaths parked in front of the
house about midnight but I
figured if we left them alone
theyd go away

Detective Peters is put off by the sarcasm coming from
someone who appears so motherly He looks to Lynn who smiles
uncomfortably

DETECTIVE PETERS
Maam I need to know if you saw
anything out of the ordinary last
night or heard anything

GALE
Dont you think Id have called
the police in that case

DETECTIVE PETERS
Maybe Maybe not It might not
have struck you as strange at the
time but maybe now with whats
happened

LYNN
What exactly happened

DETECTIVE PETERS
(not particularly
sympathetic)
Your neighbors have been murdered
I cant tell you any more than
that right now

He hands them both a card

DETECTIVE PETERS
If something comes to you give me
a ring huh

GALE
Thats all Thats all the
questions youre going to ask

DETECTIVE PETERS
Oh hey Sorry Did either of you
happen to kill the Olsons

Gale is not amused Lynns watching them carry a bodybag on
a stretcher out of the Olsons house Something about the
sight has trapped her gaze

DETECTIVE PETERS
(didnt really need
an answer anyway)
Okay Thanks One of my guys will
be over to take your names

LYNN

Detective Im sorry Im already
late

(she digs in her

purse and pulls out

a card)
This has my name and cel phone
number on it Imhouse sitting
here for the next couple of weeks

DETECTIVE PETERS
(looking at the card)
An artist huh You dont much
look like an artist

GALE
Says the rock-star detective

Peters spares her a glance but ignores her The way Lynn
stumbled over the half-lie seems to have caught the
detectives attention

DETECTIVE PETERS
How long you beenhouse sitting

LYNN
About four no five nights

DETECTIVE PETERS
(nods his head)
I may have to come by later and
ask you a few questions Miss
(checks the card

again)
Blodgett
LYNN
Sure I understand
(beat)

Oh no Im sorry Ive got an
exhibit tonight so I wont be
back at all today Tomorrow should
be fine though

GALE
Why dont you leave her alone Do
you think she did it Is that what
your keen detective mind is
telling you
The detective turns a bemused smile on Gale

DETECTIVE PETERS
Wow Youre Miss Cleaver on the
outside but the insides a real
bitch aint it

GALE
Ex-cuse me

DETECTIVE PETERS
I guess Im not so good with the
sarcastic reh-par-tee

He stumbles over the word like its too hard to wrap his
tongue around but theres a quiet intelligence in his eyes
An intelligence that just filed Gale under B for bitch

He wanders off shaking his head

GALE
His superiors going to hear about
this

LYNN

(rushing off)
Well it was nice meeting you Im
really really late now

GALE
(calls after her)
Im Gale Gale Wroten

Lynn waves back without looking and hightails it to the car
INT GALLERY - DAY

The gallery looks new Shiny hardwood floors Small rooms
showcase paintings on the wall with new wave furniture
awaiting the pretentious ass of some wannabe art critic

Lynn rushes in AMANDA 23 steps out with a clipboard Shes
cute in a mousy Lisa Loeb kind of way

AMANDA
Lynn hey

LYNN
Sorry Im late Youll never
believe the morning Im having

AMANDA
No worries Everythings going
pretty hokay OOPS still hasnt
delivered two of the pieces but
everything else is here
LYNN
Phil around

AMANDA
Yup

As if he heard PHILLIP REID rounds the corner Hes kind-
faced late thirties dressed in an old-fashioned brown
suit-and-vest Hes got the makings of a slight gut

PHILLIP
Lynn some of these new pieces are
amazing Youve been doing great
work lately Fabulous stuff

LYNN
Thanks Phil And thank you so
much for this

PHILLIP
Its my pleasure
(takes on an
aristocratic air)
You know how prestigious it is to
once again be showcasing the great
Lynn Blodgett at my gallery

LYNN
Oh please

PHILLIP
If Picasso were still alive Id
turn him down to get you

AMANDA
Ass kisser

LYNN
Well thanks It means a lot to me

PHILLIP
What do you think Should we
expect a crowd tonight
AMANDA
I think youll be pleasantly
surprised
On Lynns questioning look

INT GALLERY - NIGHT

Same place plus a hundred people No one speaks loud Its
all QUIET MURMURS over wine or mixed drinks

Lynns standing against a back wall with Amanda She looks
dazed

LYNN
(quiet)
Howon earthdid you get all
these people here

AMANDA
WWW dot I hate clowns dot com I
posted it on their message
board

LYNN
Butif they hate clowns why
would they come

AMANDA
Its a love-hate thing

Lynn shakes her head she doesnt understand but whos
complaining

She touches Amandas arm to signal that shes moving She
begins to weave aimlessly among the people pausing just long
enough to catch whether they like her stuff or not Most seem
to

INTO ANOTHER ROOM

not as crowded as the main room A COUPLE murmurs about the
painting in front of them while across the room is TUCK 28
Hes dark-skinned Latino dressed like a model Hes staring
deeply at one of Lynns clown paintings

She sidles up trying to be sly

LYNN
So what do you think

TUCK
(spares her a quick
look then back to
the painting)
Im not an art critic or
anything

LYNN
Who is

TUCK
(nods then back to
the painting)
Its okay I dont know what the
clown fetish is all about--I think
the artist has issues

Lynn smiles Not what she expected to hear
LYNN
(good-natured)

Oh

TUCK
Welltheyre clowns for
chrissakes

But hers are all soscary Did
you see the one where you walk in
I think I remember that one from
Stephen Kings It

Lynn smiles Shes looking forward to embarrassing him when
she introduces herself

LYNN
But youre no art critic

TUCK
No Tucker Flynn My friends call
me Tuck

He extends his hand

LYNN
Lynn--

TUCK
--Blodgett I know
(mischievous smile)
I saw your picture in the program

She smiles and reappraises him

TUCK
I didnt want to blow your cover
Not right away anyway

LYNN
So what do you really think

TUCK
Theyre good I meantheyre
great
(the smile returns)
Youve still got issues butI
think theyre phenomenal

She can tell hes sincere about his appreciation Shes
touched

LYNN
Thanks You from the web site

TUCK
There are
chemistry

Web site

LYNN
Oh nothing What made you stop by
tonight

TUCK
This is the best gallery in
Baltimore Ive bought a couple of
pieces here

LYNN
Anything of mine

TUCK
No Honestly I never noticed your
stuff before but Ill definitely
be keeping my eye out now

serious looks going on between them

a quick

that seems to be catching Lynn off guard

LYNN
WellI hope you have a good time

She starts to move off

TUCK
Hey You wanna--
(shrugs)
--maybe go out and get a drink
later

LYNN
Uh---

Is she searching for an excuse or thinking about accepting

Shes married

He smiles

She turns

She stops

LYNN
Its just a bad time

his understanding

TUCK
Sure No problem

to move off

TUCK
How bout tomorrow

LYNN
Its complicated

she cant be going out on dates
TUCK
Oh

LYNN
Im married

TUCK
(sudden
understanding)
Ooooh

LYNN
I mean Im separated

TUCK
(no problem then)
Oh Great I mean not great like
Im happy about it---
(realizes hes
screwing up)
Hi Im Tuck Ill be right back

He heads over to the nearest tuxedos waiter and grabs a
champagne glass He holds it up to toast Lynn then DOWNS it
in one swallows

Then he grabs two others off the tray and returns to
Lynn

TUCK
I thought if it didnt cost too
much I could get a guided tour of
your work

Lynn smiles at his persistance Theres something immaturely
endearing about him His smile is contagious

She takes the drink

LYNN
I could probably put it on your
tab

Tucks glad shes going along for the ride He steps up to
the painting in front of them

TUCK
Take this one I notice that this
clown seems to be in a lot of your
paintings Whats the significance

The more astute viewers will recognize the clown as the one
from the dream in the beginning In the painting hes
staring out at us with a look of sinister intent Hes in a
stark white hallway with strange objects on the wall

She stares at it intently as if shes never seen it before
as if shes falling into it

An excited Amanda pops up behind her saving her from
answering

AMANDA
Boss The mayor is here

LYNN
The mayor Of the city

AMANDA
No of Sesame Street
(notices Tuck)
Whos the hunk

Lynns still shocked about the mayor thing but not so much
that she cant be embarrassed too

LYNN
Sorry Tuck this is my number one
cheerleader Amanda She created
my web site and does all my other
promotion for me

Tuck smiles at her ga-ga expression

TUCK
Nice to meet you

AMANDA
Um hmmm Id like to shake my bon
bons all over your--

LYNN
Amanda Go tell Phillip Ill be
right over

AMANDA
Okay

She gives Tuck one last lascivious look and then shes off

LYNN
Sorry about that

TUCK
Its flattering

LYNN
I guess I should go say hi to the
mayor

TUCK

Is he really here or is that just
a ploy you two use to impress
people
LYNN
I think hes really here

TUCK

Impressive Can I get your

autograph later

LYNN

Sure Hang around Ill be back

She gives him a fleeting smile and walks away As soon as her

back is turned to him she makes a face

doing

What the hell is she

And then her expression turns to dismayed shock

BERT her soon-to-be ex-husband rounds the corner a wine

glass in hand

BERT
Lynn There you are

LYNN
(quiet)
What the hell are you doing here

BERT
What Whats the matter

LYNN
Whos watching Nicky

BERT
Hes in great hands dont worry

LYNN
So why are you here Bert

BERT
I came to see your new exhibit of
course

LYNN
Bert What the hell is wrong with
you Were not friends
(as if hes forgotten)
You filed for divorce

BERT
Only because you were going to

LYNN
Were not doing this here Please
leave

BERT
Dont get all apoplectic on me I
didnt realize youd get so upset

LYNN
Why wouldnt I This is an

important night for me

BERT
All right Ill go

LYNN
Thanks

He takes a final sip of his drink before putting it down

BERT
Tll call you later

Hes gone before he can see the look of disgust that crosses
Lynns face

She takes a calming breath before she goes looking for the
mayor

INT GALLERY - LATER

The crowd is mostly gone Lynns walking through room after
room Shes looking for Tuck but trying not to act like it

Room after room(and blank spaces reveal that the gallery was
successful in moving some of her paintings) and no Tuck
es starting to get discouraged

a

She comes back around to the front counter and there he is
talking with Phil Lynn suppresses a smile

PHILLIP
Here she comes

TUCK
Can I get that autograph now

He lifts something from the counter that was hidden behind
his body Its one of Lynns paintings

LYNN
Butthats

PHILLIP
Your new admirer just purchased
your most expensive piece my dear

LYNN
Thats eight thousand dollars

TUCK
And worth every penny When its
worth two-hundred grand youll
beg to buy it back

(to Phillip)
Go ahead and wrap it up Ill get
her to autograph it once its
hanging up in my house

Phillip doesnt get it for a moment Then he sees the blush
on Lynns cheek He gets it

PHILLIP
Oh Ohof course

He begins wrapping as Lynn and Tuck exchange looks

LYNN
Do you mind me asking what you do
Tuck

TUCK

Wanna see

LYNN
(playful flirting)
I think that would depend on what
it is you do

PHILLIP
Im just uh Ive got to get some
tape from the other room

Clearly uncomfortable with their flirting he goes into
another room

TUCK
Seriously You want to see what I
do my office isnt very far away

LYNN

Okay But only because you just
paid my rent for three
months

(louder toward the

other room)
Phillip Ill be back soon Im
going to see Mr Flynns office

EXT GALLERY

Tuck escorts Lynn outside and opens the passenger door of his
Porsche He shuts the door after she pulls her legs in

ACROSS THE STREET

in the shadows of an alley stands a man He watches as Tuck
gets in the Porsche starts it and drives away
As it exits the scene the man steps forward to watch its
progress We see its Bert a menacing scowl on his face

INT TUCKS OFFICE - LATER

Tuck lets Lynn into the office She takes a look around as he
goes to the alarm and turns it off The office is very nice
Clean well-organized tastefully decorated

TUCK
This is my office

Its big She walks down the hall Tuck following behind her
indulging her whim to lead

LYNN
Sowhat do you do

TUCK
Look at the pictures

Shes been walking by the pictures on the wall but now she
stops to take a better look The pictures seem to be of
elaborate roller coasters at various theme parks

LYNN
I still dont get it

TUCK
My company designs roller
coasters Disney Kings Dominion
Busch Gardens you name it Ive
got a coaster there

Lynns impressed

LYNN
How old are you

TUCK
Old enough to pick touch football
over tackle

LYNN
Why dont you want to tell me

TUCK
How old are you

LYNN
(smiles)
Touche

Shes peering close to one picture It shows some crazy
sumbitch standing on the highest point of a tall roller
coaster no car
TUCK
Thats me

LYNN
No

She looks closer Its a far off shot but it sure looks like
it could be him

TUCK
Every time they finish a new
coaster of mine I like to stand
at the highest point

LYNN
Youre out of your mind

TUCK
(shrugs)
Im a thrill seeker what can I
say

The playful smile never leaves his face Shes clearly amazed
at the guts it takes to do what he does

Tuck leans in close over her shoulder as she stares at
another picture

TUCK
Impressed

Shes not spooked by how close he is She doesnt want to let
on that shes impressed though

LYNN
I dont really like roller
coasters

Hes non-plussed He moves past her down the hall toward an
exit door

TUCK
How do you feel about

He opens the door and flicks on the light Its a giant game
room A pool table in the center A twenty foot shuffleboard
game to the side A big screen TV in the corner with a sofa
in front of it A refrigerator the works

TUCK
shuffleboard

She follows him into the room Its getting harder and harder
to hide being impressed

TUCK
Can I get you a beer
Hes at the fridge Lynn has a moment Put a halt to it right
now before it all gets out of hand The reasons are many In
the middle of a divorce Tuck is younger than she is shes
got a kid She doesnt even really know this guy

LYNN
Sure

TUCK
(as hes getting them)
So howd you get set up at the
gallery

LYNN
Oh Phillip owns it

TUCK
Seems awfully young to own an art
gallery doesnt he I picture
gallery owners as you know over

fifty
LYNN
He inherited it when his parents
died
(sheepish)

It seems funny now but I actually
met himon the internet An art
forum

When he found out I was in the
same city and a painterhe
offered to take a look at my stuff

TUCK
I guess he liked it

LYNN
(nods)
Weve had a bunch of showings but
none went like tonight

For a second she looks like she thinks she shouldnt have
said that She breaks eye contact but quickly looks back and
smiles

TUCK
So how about a game of pool

EXT TUCKS OFFICE - LATER
Tuck locks up the office behind them as they leave
TUCK

Not to sound sexist but for a
girl youre pretty good at pool
LYNN
Not to sound sexist

TUCK
Yeah thats why I prefaced it
that way

From around a bush steps a MUGGER Hes mean-faced and alert
All business

MUGGER
Gimme your money

Tuck moves protectively in front of Lynn The muggers not
intimidated more interested in Lynn

MUGGER
Gimme the purse and there wont be
no trouble

Tuck eyes the mugger for a moment then holds his hand out to
Lynn She gives him the purse

He tosses it to the mugger who catches it in his knifeless
hand The mugger reaches in pulls out the wallet and pockets
it He smiles a little more confidently

MUGGER
What else she got

TUCK
You got the money Get out of
here

MUGGER

I think you best run off
loverboy Ill see her home

TUCK
Take the easy score Its all
downhill from here

The mugger edges in Tuck pushes Lynn back farther

TUCK
(never taking his
eyes off the mugger)
When you get the chance Lynn
throw a rock at my office window

The mugger rushes He feints and slashes across Tucks
stomach Tuck jumps back but theres a rip across his shirt
now

Holding the knife up the mugger admires the thin red coat
now along one side
MUGGER
Wanna reconsider loverboy

Nothing from Tuck Still riveted on the mugger
The mugger takes two steps and jabs the knife Tuck steps to

the side grabs the muggers hand and jams an elbow into his
ide

io

The instant Tuck grabs the muggers arm LYNN HURLS HER
KEYCHAIN five pounds of keys at the office door It doesnt
shatter the window but spider-web cracks appear and a LOUD
ALARM BEGINS GOING OFF inside

When Tuck elbows the mugger he drops the knife Tuck uses
his weight to whirl the mugger away from him causing him to
tumble off balance and fall A METALLIC CLATTER as a gun
falls out of the muggers waistband

The mugger snatches the gun

TUCK
Run

Lynn and Tuck run off toward the end of the building

The mugger briefly points his gun at the fleeing couple but
something keeps him from firing Hes pissed He spares one
irritated glance toward where the alarm is WAILING and he
runs off in the other direction

DISSOLVE TO
INT CAR - LATER
Tucks car pulls up in front of the house Lynns staying in
Lynn exhausted doesnt move to open the door right away
She stares at the house
TUCK

You sure youre all right I can
take you to a friends house

LYNN
Im okay Youre the one who got
stabbed

TUCK

Slashed not stabbed Ive done
worse shaving

Lynn nods absently as if shes not even listening She
reaches for the door handle

LYNN
Wellgood night
TUCK
Hey

He grabs her arm gently

TUCK
Ill call you tomorrow

She barely nods gets out of the car and walks to her house
Tuck waits until shes in the house before he pulls away

INT HOUSE

Lynn leans back against the front door and closes her eyes
Exhausted With the mugging on top of her exhibit its just
too much Shes ready to drop

She trudges into the kitchen and pours herself a glass of
wine The PHONE RINGS

She spares a look at the clock--pretty late for a call--and
picks up the phone

LYNN
Hello

Behind her something outside moves past the kitchen windows

PHILLIP (PHONE)
Lynn

LYNN
Phillip What are you doing up
this late

A non-rhythmic tapping can be heard coming from somewhere in
the other room Like a branch against a window

PHILLIP (PHONE)
Youve had me worried sick Ive
called ten times since eleven
oclock

LYNN
Butwhy

PHILLIP (PHONE)
You leave the exhibit with some
strange man you dont even know
and you wonder why Im worrying

LYNN
Youre right Im sorry

PHILLIP
Where have you been all this time
Lynn notices the tapping She moves into the television room
The tapping seems to be coming from outside the sliding glass
door

LYNN
Long story Long long story

She cant see anything outside the window its so dark

LYNN
Youll never believe what happened

She flicks on the lightswitch next to the door
The clown stands there revealed in the light Like Lynns
worst nightmare like the clown in the painting Tuck pointed

out the one that Lynn paints often the one from her dream

His pupil-less eyes however are black as night The
soulless eyes of a shark

Hes staring right at Lynn

PHILLIP (PHONE)
What What happened

The clown cocks his head and leans closer his breath fogging
the glass Lynn faints the phone dropping uselessly to the
rug

With a rumble the sliding glass door opens to the clowns
pull He steps inside the house

PHILLIP (PHONE)
Lynn Hello

FADE OUT
From the BLACK comes voices Echoes distant and distorted
VOICE
(coming into focus)
Can you hear me Miss Blodgett
can you open your eyes

LYNNS POV

as she opens her eyes Someones leaning over her waving
something under her nose Its a MEDIC

MEDIC
You with me now

LYNN
Yes
She sits up with his help

MEDIC
Do you feel okay Does anything
hurt

LYNN

No I dont think so

MEDIC
Did you hit your head when you
fell

Lynn sees theres a COP standing behind the medic listening
His presence distracts her for a moment

LYNN
Uhno I dont think so

Detective Peters letting himself in

COP
(to Lynn)

He intercepts Peters before he can make it over Theres
HUSHED CONVERSATION between them ending in a questioning
glance to the cop who shrugs

Detective Peters comes over and sits down across from Lynn

LYNN

DETECTIVE PETERS

Lynn shuts the door without a word She stands there the
thoughts running wild through her exhausted head

DISSOLVE TO
INT GALLERY - DAY

Lynn walks in holding hands with her son NICHOLAS aka
Nicky Hes about five years old

Phillip Amanda and MR PARRISH turn from one of Lynns
paintings toward her Mr Parrish is a distinguished older
man dressed very well and holding a cane though he doesnt
appear to need it

LYNN
Heywhats going on

MR PARRISH
Have you ever been spanked by a
clown Miss Blodgett

Lynn doesnt know whether to laugh or be offended

LYNN
Excuse me

Mr Parrish hands her a photograph In the photo is a clown
mugging for the camera with a bunch of kids at a birthday
party

MR PARRISH
My father He used to be a clown
for neighborhood birthday parties
A very strange thing This man who
brings joy and smiles to everyone
around himis also the man who
comes home and spanks youhits
you with his hand or his belt Not
happy to do it mind you but
doing his duty as a father
punishing a son
Lynns listening patiently but cant see where hes going

MR PARRISH
You paint magnificently I dont
like the ones with the frightening
clowns though I dont know why
you waste your time with those
But the ones like this

He points to the one they were all admiring when Lynn came
in The clown in the painting gazes sadly on the wilted
flower in his hand

MR PARRISH
Incredible Perfect His
expressionI want you to capture
that for me

LYNN
Im sorry Mr

MR PARRISH
Parrish Endle Parrish

LYNN
Im sorry Mr Parrish I dont
know what youre talking about

MR PARRISH

I want you to paint a picture of
my father I want you to show me
a clown saddened that he has to
spank his son

Lynns expression says it all How strange Lynn looks to
Phillip or Amanda for support Neither says anything but
theyre smiling Like something else is coming

LYNN
Mr Parrish Im sorry but I dont
do commission pieces Im not even
sure I could--

MR PARRISH
Ten thousand dollars Cash if
youd like

Shes speechless for a moment Even Phillip and Amanda are
shocked They knew the guy was loaded but thats more than
even they expected

LYNN
I dont I mean I could sell you

that one for a lot less

MR PARRISH
No It has to look like my father
I want an original painting of my
father and I need it in three days

LYNN
Thats just impossible I can
recommend a number of excellent
painters--

MR PARRISH
No It must be you

LYNN
Im sorry I cant do it

MR PARRISH
Twenty thousand dollars Thats my
final offer

LYNN
You dont understand--

PHILLIP
Lynn could we speak to you for a
moment
LYNN
(to Amanda regarding
Nick)

Can you keep an eye on him

Amanda nods Nickys happy playing with his action figures on
a bench

Phillip pulls her into the other room leaving Mr Parrish to
gaze at her paintings

LYNN
I cant Phillip I dont have the
time right now

PHILLIP
Make the time You cant be too
busy for that kind of money

LYNN
I am Im getting divorced Thats
why Im going to move Get away
get a new start

He doesnt act surprised Either that or he doesnt think it
matters

PHILLIP
Youve got to think this through
Lynn Can you imagine what this is
going to do for your other
paintings For your reputation
Once people hear Mr Parrish paid
twenty thousand for one of your
paintings it will open the flood
gates You wont be consigned to
showing your paintings in my
galleryyoull be all over the
country

Lynns starting to see the picture

LYNN
Im not sure I can do it

PHILLIP
Of course you can

Shes not so sure She gives him one more unsure look before
going back into the other room

MR PARRISH
Youll do it

LYNN
I cant promise you Ill get it
done

He ignores her

MR PARRISH
(handing her the
photo again)
Excellent My phone number is on
the back Call me when youve
finished and let me know how youd
like the payment

She takes it Mr Parrish hangs the cane on the crook of his
arm and if he had a hat hed probably doff it

MR PARRISH
Good day

He swaggers out
AMANDA
(in awe)
Twenty thousand dollarsthatll
buy a lot of bandwidth

Neither Phillip nor Lynn know what shes talking about

AMANDA
Tres geek huh

LYNN
Yeah
PHILLIP
What happened last night I called
the police but wouldnt tell me

anything

LYNN
Im sorry I dont even know where
to start

AMANDA

(totally in the dark)
What What happened

LYNN
Youll never believe itget me
some coffee and Ill tell you
about it

EXT BASEMENT - DAY

The backyard of a run-down house Concrete stairs lead down
the back to a basement door

A noise Like a MUFFLED SHOUT followed by a dull THWACK Its
coming from inside the house

INT BASEMENT

The basement is dark and bare undecorated cinderblock walls
The concrete floor is uncarpeted A thin mattress sits in the
corner surrounded by opened soda cans and other trash The
windows are covered so that the only light is from a bulb in
the ceiling

A simple wooden table stands in the center of the room an
answering machine sitting on top of it Next to the table is
a wooden stump

The clown breathing heavily holds an axe

No warning He swings the axe into the stump as hard as he
can YELLING like a savage

CLOWN
GEEEEEEEEEEEEHHHHHT

He pulls the axe out mumbling as he exhales from the effort

CLOWN
--better

Again he swings the axe again the YELL

CLOWN
GET
Pulls it out

CLOWN
Better

Over and over again reciting the litany a cruel smile on
his face

INT GALLERY - LATER

Lynn and her friends have retired to the more comfortable
reception area Nick has his action figures battling
underneath the magazine table

LYNN
The police took our statements
but it didnt seem like they
thought theyd catch him

AMANDA
Thats a really nice area I cant
believe someone mugged you

PHILLIP
What happened when I called you

Lynn has an internal debate She decides to spare herself the
embarrassment of the clown story

LYNN
I dont know I guess it all just
caught up to me I must have
passed out

AMANDA
You passed out Whats that like

LYNN
It felt a lot like hitting the
floor

PHILLIP

You need to take it easy Lynn
And I dont think that includes
leaving with strange men at night

LYNN
Is that you dad

AMANDA
Hes right You should stay away
from that guy
(beat)
Give me his phone number and Ill
pass him the message

Lynn smirks at her
LYNN
Anyway I have to get going to the
mediation Youre sure youre all
right with watching Nicky for an
hour

AMANDA
Not a problem I dont have class
until four

LYNN
Great Thanks a lot

AMANDA
Dont thank me Im billing you

PHILLIP
What exactly is supposed to happen
at this mediation

LYNN
(shrugs)
Im not sure I think we have to
sit down and decide who gets what
and what his visitation rights are
going to be

INT MEDIATION ROOM - DAY

A sterile meeting room with a lacquered table and office
chairs Theres a sweating metal pitcher of water at the
center of the table

LYNN
Are you out of your fucking mind

Lynn and her lawyer MARTY are on one side Bert and his
lawyer OSBOURNE across from them The MEDIATOR a man with a
wooden face sits at the head of the table

MEDIATOR
Mind the language please

Osbournes a no-nonsense older man and looks like hes
accustomed to taking apart multi-million dollar corporations
before breakfast

OSBOURNE
Thats what we want Sole custody
of Nicholas Half of the ownership
of every painting youve created
since you married or half the
price if youve sold them already
You can keep your car Bert wont
ask for any palimony but youll
have to pay child support
Lynn looks at Marty in disbelief then back at Bert

LYNN
You can kiss my ass

MEDIATOR
Miss Blodgett thats not helpful

OSBOURNE
And please direct your comments to
me

LYNN
Why Is he too chickenshit to talk
to me
(shakes her head)
I cant believe Im hearing this
Marty

Marty seems like more of your public defender type attorney

MARTY
Thats not going to fly guys
Lynn gets sole custody Full
alimony and child support Bert
can keep his house--

OSBOURNE
The house was his before the
marriage Its not in her name at
all Our terms arent negotiable
Marty

Your client has no home--very
unstable for the child If she
tries to buy one before the
divorce goes through well pursue

half of it
LYNN
(to Bert)
Oh my God

Osbourne tries a sympathetic smile and fails

OSBOURNE
(to Marty)
You dont want to play hardball
with me Im short stop in the
majors and you couldnt play
outfield in the minors

Marty knows hes outclassed

MARTY
We just want a fair deal
Osbourne Thats all were looking
for

OSBOURNE
Were offering you a fair deal

MARTY
He wants her to pay child
support Hes a doctor for

godsakes

OSBOURNE
Hes been unemployed for over six
months

LYNN

What Whats he been doing

OSBOURNE
Its not your business

LYNN
Its not my business Hes still
my husband you son of a bitch
Where has he been going everyday

MEDIATOR
Please Miss--

LYNN
No I want an answer Where the
hell has my husband been going
every day for the past six months
if he wasnt going to work

MEDIATOR
Okay lets call it a day

Lynn slams her hand on the table

LYNN
Bullshit

Marty touches her arm and raises his eyebrows to let her know
shes getting out of line She takes a moment to calm down

MEDIATOR
Lets meet Monday after everyones
had a chance to cool down

MARTY
(before Lynn can
speak)
Sounds good

He reaches across to shake Osbournes hand but Osbourne only
nods and begins packing his papers into his briefcase
OSBOURNE
Ill fax our terms to your office
You do have a fax machine

MARTY
Of course

Osbourne nods and guides Bert out of the office Neither meet
Lynns smoldering gaze

LYNN
You really stuck it to him Marty

Hes surprised by her attack

MARTY
What What do you mean

Lynn doesnt respond She fights back tears

LYNN
Im not losing Nicholas I cant
lose him

MARTY

Itll be all right Well get him
She doesnt look reassured
INT BASEMENT - DAY

Its the dark basement again Same table Same answering
machine on the table but the red light is blinking now

The clown stands in front of the table staring at the light
The red casts a dull reflection in his black eyes

He pushes the button The voice that issues from the machine
is deep and electronically altered

VOICE (FROM MACHINE)
You want to get better dont you

The clown nods imperceptibly

VOICE (FROM MACHINE)
You are getting better Not much
longer and youll be cured But
firsttake the van

CLOWN
The murder van

Theres a pause as the voice seems to consider this Is it an
answering machine or some kind of intercom
VOICE (FROM MACHINE)
Do not kill her Follow her
Frighten her Make her doubt her
own sanity But do not harm
heryet Let no one else see
you Go

The clown turns and leaves
INT HOUSE - DAY

TUCK
(into phone)
Hey Lynn can I call you back

Lynn smiles and plays his game

LYNN
(into phone)
Sure

They both hang up Lynn opens the screen door for him

TUCK
So I was thinkingthe circus is
in town and if you wanted to go

once

That idea doesnt thrill Lynn
LYNN
I dont think so

TUCK
Why are you so afraid of clowns

LYNN
Im not afraid of them

TUCK
You are too

LYNN
I am not Just because I paint
them--

TUCK

Just because you paint scary
clowns Only scary clowns

Lynn walks away picks her mail off the table and busies
herself sorting it

LYNN
That doesnt mean Im scared of
them

TUCK

What does it mean then
That stumps Lynn
TUCK

Its okay Theres even a word for
it Coulrophobia

LYNN
Coulrophobia
TUCK
Fear of clowns Lot of people have
it
LYNN
Really
TUCK

Im not smart enough to make up a
word like that

LYNN
So what are you afraid of

He takes a moment A playful smile on his face Weighing the
moment to tell the truth or lie
TUCK
Silence Being alone

Hes still smiling But something in his eyes is daring her
to understand his words

LYNN
Lots of people feel that way So
how could you possibly be alone

He doesnt answer

TUCK
Want to do something strange

LYNN
Thats a loaded question

TUCK
You like to take pictures

LYNN
Sure I do a lot of photo-
referencing

TUCK

Grab your camera Come on

Again she knows she shouldnt be doing it Theres something
about him that draws her though Like a moth to the flame

LYNN
Okay Just let me call Amanda
first

EXT HOUSE

Today Tuck has his motorcycle a sleek black machine that
looks built for speed

LYNN
On that

TUCK
Perfectly safe

He hands her a helmet He hops on and helps her mount the
bike behind him

TUCK
Hold on

He starts the motorcycle and ROARS off Lynn gripping him
tightly around the waist

Behind them a van with tinted-black windows starts up and
pulls out
EXT WOODS - DAY

Tuck pulls his cycle into a cul-de-sac off of the main road
A high fence runs the entire length of the road but theres
a hole in it where it curves for the cul-de-sac

He helps Lynn off and stacks the helmets on the back

TUCK
Come on

He leads her to the hole and helps her climb through

Once through theyre in a wooded area Lots of trees and ivy
and overgrowth

Tuck takes her hand and leads her
EXT LAND OF MYTH

They emerge from the woods into a huge clear area Everywhere
you look is the remnants of what used to be a theme park
devoted to fairy tales

A plastic statue of Jack(no sign of Jill) lies on the ground
covered by weeds A tall beanstalk like the one Jack might
have climbed(had his been made of metal) creeps up to the sky
but doesnt go as far as it used to A castle that was once
pristine is falling to ruin and ivy threatens to pull down
its every wall

LYNN
Where are we

TUCK
It was called The Land Of Myth
They closed it down about fifteen
years ago

LYNN
Oh my GodIve been here As a
kid

TUCK

Me too It was popular for a while

As they talk theyre walking through whats left of the
displays Lynn begins taking pictures

TUCK
Kind of creepy now isnt it

LYNN
Tell you the truth I thought it
was kind of creepy back then
TUCK
You did

LYNN
Something about it gave me the
willies But now to see it like
thiswhy did they leave
everything here

TUCK
Dont know Maybe it was hard to

move Maybe no one wanted it

She keeps snapping pics

TUCK
Well have to compare pictures
sometime

LYNN

You take pictures

TUCK
Yep I took a lot of photography
classes in college

LYNN
I wish Id brought some black and
white film

TUCK

Its okay you can make them black
and white with a computer

LYNN
Really

TUCK
Sure You can do just about
anything with a computer

There is movement behind them as the clown peers from around
one of the exhibits

Lynn says nothing Shes mulling over something in her mind
Tuck senses it and gives her time just keeps checking out
all the relics

LYNN
Listen I have to level with you
My life is kind of a train wreck
right now

TUCK
So

LYNN
Wellwhat are we doing

TUCK
(shrugs)
Getting to know each other

LYNN
Why

Tucks playing stupid

TUCK
What do you mean why

LYNN
Come on Im attracted to you and
I think youre attracted to me
But this isits just a bad time

TUCK
(playing stupid)
Youre attracted to me

Lynn stops walking and smirks at him until he gives

TUCK
Okay okay So were past the
subtext Whats the problem

LYNN
Its really complicated

TUCK
You said that already Youre
getting divorced Whats
complicated

LYNN
You asked for it

TUCK

CLOWN POV
Hes stalking them They continue to talk oblivious of the
fact that theres a psychotic clown standing fifty feet
behind them
He moves closer still
RESUME

LYNN

away from me
TUCK
Why is the house still in his ex-
wifes name How longs it been

TUCK

LYNN
I should have known I mean hes
aman with a cat Single men with
cats are bad news At least
thats what the magazines say

TUCK
(laughs)
Did you get enough pictures

LYNN
Ready to go

He nods They head back the way they came not seeing the
clown as he circles around a structure to keep out of their
sight At one point hes close enough to reach out and touch
them

BACK AT THE MOTORCYCLE

Lynn climbs on back as Tuck pulls on his driving gloves He
straightens the motorcycle and in the side mirror the clown

ducks back into the bushes

TUCK
Ready

She grabs him around the stomach

LYNN
Yeah
He takes off
DISSOLVE TO
EXT HOUSE - LATER

Tuck pulls his cycle up to the curb and turns it off She
hops off just as Detective Peters gets out of his car across
the street He looks like hes been waiting for a while

DETECTIVE PETERS
Miss Blodgett

Lynn turns and sees him Tuck does too and something passes
across his face He can tell Peters is a cop and theres
instant friction Like two alpha males trying to stake out
their territory

DETECTIVE PETERS
How you doing

LYNN
Fine

Theres the briefest moment where the detective waits for
Lynn to introduce him to Tuck She doesnt so he takes the
initiative

DETECTIVE PETERS
Detective Peters homicide

TUCK
Homicide

DETECTIVE PETERS
Yeah thats when somebody dies

TUCK
(no shit)
Thanks

DETECTIVE PETERS
There was a murder yesterday a few
doors down

(looks to Lynn then

back to Tuck)
Now Miss Blodgett is seeing clowns
in her backyard

Tuck shoots Lynn a questioning look She rolls her eyes like
shes tired of this guy Tuck turns his attention back to

Peters

TUCK
Takes a clown to catch a clown
huh

He laughs like hes kidding but Peters gets the jibe He
gives a little laugh makes a show of examining Tucks

motorcycle

DETECTIVE PETERS
You know what us cops call these

TUCK
No

DETECTIVE PETERS
A donorcycle Whenever theres an
accident with one of them we pick
up the rider and his brains all
scrambled but the rest of him is
A-okay Perfect organ donor

Tucks not impressed

TUCK
You know what we call cops where
I come from

DETECTIVE PETERS

TUCK

He kick-starts the motorcycle and drives off
to Lynn

DETECTIVE PETERS
Whos your friend

LYNN

DETECTIVE PETERS

LYNN

DETECTIVE PETERS

LYNN
(tiring of it)
And what are you detecting

DETECTIVE PETERS

giving a wink
LYNN

She turns on her heel and heads to her door The detective
watches her ass the entire way but makes no attempt to follow

DISSOLVE TO

Nothing fancy just some concept sketches to get the look
down

DISSOLVE TO

INT AMANDAS HOUSE -SAME TIME

Amandas at the computer She types something reads smirks
types something again

She tries again
DISSOLVE TO
INT HOUSE - LATER

Lynns got about ten pages of sketches next to her Outside
her window night has fallen

But the sketch shes working on now is different Shes got
colored pencils and charcoal and is pencilling the clown she
seems to be obsessed with

Except now his eyes are exactly like the one she saw outside
her sliding-glass door the previous night Black reflecting
a pinprick of light

She stops and takes a good look at her handiwork Then
realizes that shes put off her paying project to do more

sketches of her obsession

LYNN
For Gods sake

She pushes it to the side and begins setting up her easel to
paint

DISSOLVE TO
INT AMANDAS HOUSE -SAME TIME

Amanda scrolls down clicks A new page pops up Amanda
begins reading but suddenly sits back
AMANDA
Woah

She reads some more scrolls down

AMANDA
Woah

She grabs the phone casting a glance at the clock Ten
forty Might be a little late with Lynn having Nicky
Disappointed she hangs up the phone

With a click of the mouse she opens up her email and begins
writing Just a quick note She clicks SEND

DISSOLVE TO
INT HOUSE - SAME TIME

Lynn paints Broad strokes getting a feel for the paper for
the piece

NICHOLAS (0OS)
Mom-meeeeee

Shes instantly broken out of her artist trance She rushes
up the stairs

LYNN
You thirsty Nicky

DISSOLVE TO
INT AMANDAS HOUSEBATHROOM -SAME TIME

The bathroom is steamy as Amanda steps out one towel around
her body as she uses another to dry her hair

She moves into her bedroom The head towel gets tossed onto
the bed She begins blow-drying her hair with the electric
hair dryer on her dresser

Casually No hurry She spares a glance at herself in the
mirror as she blows her hair back She notices the curtains
of her room move gently in the breeze behind her

She frowns and switches off the dryer She goes to the
window She has to climb onto the bed to get to it and
immediately theres a slight TINKLING of glass

Behind the bed lies broken glass There doesnt seem to be
any of it on the bedsheet

Amanda frowns even more What the--

She pushes the curtain out of the way Theres a hole in her
window about the size of a baseball Or a fist
For a moment it really doesnt bother her Some kid must have
thrown something through her window

Then she sees her window screen lying in the grass outside
partially bent She pushes curtains aside to look at the top
of the window Its unlocked

Her eyes go wide Shes frightened but not the kind prone to
panic She goes for the portable phone by her bedits not
there Just an empty cradle

She curses almost silently Where did she put it

She takes a quick look around her bedroom but doesnt see it
Looking at the doorway leading into the dark hallway she
seems to have a hard time swallowing

She creeps to the doorway and listens for the sounds of an
intruder

Silence For one moment shes in indecision Maybe its
nothing(she forgot to lock the window) could have been a
baseball If someone broke into her house he would have fled
when he heard someone was home

INTO THE HALLWAY

The clown stands in the opening between the kitchen and

then being scared she scoffs

AMANDA

staircases run on both sides of the foyer to the second

An orange cat strolls out from a side room

Lynn sees the cat sees Tuck squat down to pet it and she
smiles sardonically as she remembers what she said about men
and cats

LYNN

DISSOLVE TO
INT TUCKS HOUSE - LATER

Tuck and Lynn sit at the table having just finished a lunch
that probably should have been a dinner Lynn leans back
patting her stomach

LYNN
Wow I have to tell you Im
surprised

TUCK
Why

LYNN
You really dont strike me as the
kind of guy who can cook

TUCK
Ouch
(picks up his plate
and hers)
Do I strike you as the kind who
can wash dishes

LYNN
Maybe with a dishwasher

TUCK
Make yourself at home while I
clean up

LYNN
Sure you dont want help

TUCK
Ill be all right

She wanders into what passes as a living room but is more
like a small museum Bookshelves line one side and a huge
plush couch separates the entertainment center from it A
family of four could live in his big-screen TV

She peruses his books while they talk back and forth between
rooms

TUCK
You said you should be painting
What are you working on Wait let
me guess A clown

LYNN
Ha ha Stick to cooking Ive got
a commission piece to do Has to
be done inwell two days now

TUCK
Not much time for a painting

LYNN
The moneys supposed to make up
for it

TUCK

Can I ask what your going rate is

LYNN
For this piece Im getting twenty
thousand

TUCK

Ha I told you that painting I
bought from you was a steal

Lynns been flipping through occasional books Tucks
interests are wide-ranging There are a bunch of art books
On a lower shelf sits a stack of magazines Lynn sees one she
recognizes and pulls it out

LYNN
Well see Im really not sure I

can do what the guy is asking

TUCK
Whats he asking

Lynn flips through the magazine called MODERN PAINTER and
sees a page which has been bent in to save the place

LYNN
A picture of his father

The page opens to reveal a large photo of Lynn followed by
an article about her

TUCK
Doesnt sound that tough

Lynn frowns She was under the impression that Tuck knew
nothing about her when they met

She flips to the front and notes that the magazine is months
old and has a subscription label on it with Tucks name and
address Not a recent buy

LYNN
His father was a clown and he
wants him to look a certain way

She grabs another magazine out of the stack One called ART
GALLERY There are two pages folded in The first is a
painting of hers with its name(MARYS CLOWN) and her name
under it The second page shows a picture of her with a short
biography next to it

Now shes alarmed

TUCK
I meant to ask you You think its
strange that guy tried to mug us
with a knife when hes got a gun
in his coat

Shes doesnt want to panic Ask him about it Was their
meeting just a chance thing or has he beenstalking her

LYNN
Maybe it wasnt loaded

TUCK
We wouldnt have known that--

Hes interrupted by THE DOORBELL Lynn hastily drops the Art
Gallery mag on top of a pile of magazines next to the
fireplace then goes toward the front door as Tuck answers it

Detective Peters stands on the front stoop

DETECTIVE PETERS
Lynn Blodgett here

Clearly Tucks not pleased that Peters has stopped by

TUCK
Yeah

LYNN
(steps into his line
of sight)
What is it detective

DETECTIVE PETERS
Could you come with me

TUCK
Whats going on

DETECTIVE PETERS
I need to talk to you Miss
Blodgett Lets go back to your
house

Since Peters is ignoring him Tuck physically steps between
Peters and Lynn

TUCK
Whats going on

DETECTIVE PETERS
You want to step out of the way

TUCK
You want to talk to my lawyer

Lynn puts a hand on his arm

LYNN
Its okay
(to Peters)
I take it this is important

DETECTIVE PETERS

Tuck doesnt seem to notice that Lynns a bit relieved to be
getting away

LYNN
Thanks for a great lunch

TUCK

LYNN

OUTSIDE

Detective Peters sees her to her car
LYNN
Can you tell me whats going on

DETECTIVE PETERS

LYNN
Nicholas--my son--nothings--

DETECTIVE PETERS

He heads to his car
INT HOUSE - LATER

Lynn and the detective enter As they shut the door we can
see Officer Patrick right outside the door

LYNN
Well

DETECTIVE PETERS
Sit down Please

He escorts her into the living room and gets her to sit on
the couch

DETECTIVE PETERS
Amanda Greene was murdered last
night

Her head jerks back like she was punched

LYNN
What

DETECTIVE PETERS
Im sorry I know she worked for
you

Shes a strong woman Doesnt want to show her tears so she
fights them back

LYNN
She was my friend

Its the only thing she can get out The tears course down
her cheeks

DETECTIVE PETERS
Theres more I wish I were better
with the tact but Im not

LYNN
What
DETECTIVE PETERS

The scene of--where she diedI
mean its not just that We dont
have the coroners report yet but
Id bet my shield that

(licks his lips

probably shouldnt

say anything)
well I think the person that
killed your friend is the same
person that killed the family
three doors down from you

LYNN
What

Shes having a hard time dealing with it Any of it
Amandadead killedsame as the neighbors

DETECTIVE PETERS
I dont think its a coincidence
I think someone is zeroing in on
you

Lynns too surprised to speak

DETECTIVE PETERS
Ive already said more than I
should But theres more I need
to know I have your complete
confidence that you wont repeat
what Im about to tell you To
anyone

She nods afraid to trust her voice

DETECTIVE PETERS
Amanda fought back against the
person Weve recovered blood and
tissue from under her fingernails
Andgrease paint

LYNN
Paint

Shes glancing at her paints next to her easel
DETECTIVE PETERS
Grease paint Like youd buy in
any Halloween or costume shop
LYNN
Im sorry I just I dont

understand

Peters take a photo out of his jacket pocket not showing
to her yet

DETECTIVE PETERS
The window that he entered from

Hes not sure how to say ithe shrugs and hands her the
photo

She looks at it not comprehending what shes looking at A
window with a hole in it But below that smudged white and
a red dot centered below it Then it hits her Her eyes widen
in shoc

She stands up and moves to her sketch pad She flips it open
to the clown--her clown--that she drew the night before She
holds the picture next to the sketch

Its pretty obvious that if her clown were real and he
pushed his face against a window it would leave those marks
White forehead red nose Evil Peering in Amandas window
Just like he peered in her window

She holds the sketch and the photo out to Peters He takes
them but its like he already thought

DETECTIVE PETERS
I admit that I didnt take you
seriously with your clown story
the other night

LYNN
To tell you the truthId
convinced myself it was some
hallucination or shock from being
mugged

DETECTIVE PETERS
Well you have my assurance that
Im taking you deadly serious now

LYNN
Thank you

DETECTIVE PETERS
This what he looked like when you

saw him

LYNN
Yes

DETECTIVE PETERS
His eyes are black like that

LYNN
Yes

DETECTIVE PETERS
Huh Can I have this

LYNN
Yes

He stands starts backing his way to the door

DETECTIVE PETERS
Whoever this guy iswell get
him You need to watch yourself
until we do though Ill have
someone out in front of your house
at all times

Lynn stays strong nods

DETECTIVE PETERS
Ill call you if I come up with
anything

Once hes gone though the tears flow She weeps almost
silently for her friend

EXT PARKING LOT - DAY

A car is parked under the shade of a tree Berts SAAB pulls
in next to it but during the conversation the person in the
other car cant be seen

Bert rolls his window down He tries to act like hes
watching something in front of him while he talks

BERT

Heston is the mugger who tried to rob Lynn and Tuck
HESTON

His car pulls away Bert watches him drive off but his mind
is on something else Something nagging at his brain like a
name on the tip of your tongue

INT GALLERY - LATER

Lynn enters All the make up in the world cant disguise the
fact that shes been crying

Phillips at the front desk doing paperwork He sees her and
rushes over

PHILLIP
Oh Lynn Im so sorry
He hugs her She takes a couple of deep breaths fights off

the urge to cry again

LYNN

PHILLIP
About an hour ago Some detective

came by to ask questions

LYNN
Detective Peters

She shakes her head at his persistance
LYNN
(kidding)

I think hes been following me

Phillips concerned

PHILLIP
Why would a detective be following

LYNN

I was joking At least a little
He seems to pop up all the time

PHILLIP

He retrieves some papers from behind the counter

PHILLIP
I didnt show this to the
detective I hope I wont get in

LYNN
What is it
PHILLIP
Amanda sent us all an email last

Lynn looks at it
PHILLIP
Its about Mr Parrish His father

convicted child molester One of
the children disappeared but they
could never prove he had anything
to do with it

LYNN
Oh my God

PHILLIP
The second page has some pictures

Lynn looks The pictures are from the trial One picture in
particular sticks out Mr Parrishs father sitting behind

the defendants desk with a deep look of remorse on his face

Feeling overwhelmed Lynn backs herself onto a bench

PHILLIP
Im sorry I should have waited to
show you--

LYNN

No its all right Phillip I have

to say it)

Her cel phone picks that moment to RING She looks at the
number its Tuck She doesnt want to talk to him but she
doesnt want her phone to keep ringing

moves off to talk

DISSOLVE TO
EXT BASEMENT - LATER

White cement steps lead down to the basement door Bert
doing his best to be covert creeps to the window looking
into the basement

From his vantage through a crack in the curtains he can see
THE CLOWN sitting in a chair The room is very dark but his
shape is there

Bert creeps down the steps and tries the knob It opens and
he slips in INSIDE he keeps his back to the door

BERT
(whispered hiss)

The clowns head turns slowly He looks back to the answering
machine on the table then again to Bert He stands

CLOWN

very stilted

CLOWN

BERT

The clowns breathing heavily

CLOWN

Bert doesnt take his eyes off the clown as he opens the door
and backs out The clown watches him go then sits back down

The phone begins RINGING
AT BERTS CAR

Bert rushes to his car jumps in and locks the door He
fumbles with his cel phone and dials from his phone book
BUSY

BERT

the floor but shes not happy with them

Shes got the newspaper clipping of Mr Parrishs father in
front of her referencing it

EXT HOUSE

Officer Patricks sitting on the front bench reading Stephen
Kings IT He looks up as a car passes watches it drive by
then goes back to his book

HESTONS POV

Hes parked five houses down across the street A canvas bag
is on the seat next to him

INT TUCKS HOUSE

Tuck enters tossing his keys onto a table in the foyer He
heads into the living room picks up the remote from the
table and turns to drop back into the couch--

--and he sees the Art Gallery sitting on top of the pile of
magazines He goes to it picks it up confused Definitely
not where he left it

He flips it open to the marker and Lynns face stares out at
him Then the next magazine below it with another page-marked
at Lynn

He puts two and two together immediately Mentally curses
himself He grabs the phone and dials Lynns number

INT LYNNS HOUSE
Lynn paints Pages of sketches are strewn about her All
forgotten Her mind is now on one thing the painting in

front of her

The PHONE RINGS but Lynn pays no attention Shes so focused
that she probably doesnt even hear it

Shes immersed in the work Paying no attention to anything
around her In the zone
EXT HOUSE

Officer Patrick zips up as he walks around from the backyard
where he was apparently taking a piss A van pulls up in
front of the house with PARTY-PLUS on the side

A HAPPY CLOWN gets out and walks up the sidewalk
IN HESTONS CAR

Heston leans forward very interested in whats going on He
wasnt expecting this but maybe therell be an opening

PATRICK

cant believe it--a clown walking up the sidewalk--he fumbles
out his gun and points it at the clown who doesnt notice it
because hes reading from a clipboard

OFFICER PATRICK
Stop right there

The clowns startled just about drops his clipboard

HAPPY CLOWN
WOAH What the hell

OFFICER PATRICK
Get over here get on the ground

HAPPY CLOWN
All right okay--

OFFICER PATRICK
Now

The clown lays down on the ground Officer Patrick gets on
top and handcuffs him

HAPPY CLOWN
I didnt do nothin I was called
out here

OFFICER PATRICK
Sure you were You got ID on you

HAPPY CLOWN
Inside the suit You gotta zip
down the zipper in my back pocket
there

From around the back of the house creeps SHIVERS THE CLOWN
He grips the strings from a dozen floating helium balloons

He sees the cop working to get the other clowns ID

He walks out more confidently coming up behind the two The
cops got the happy clowns ID out and is looking at it

Shivers shifts hands releasing the balloons to reveal that
hes been holding his axe hidden by the balloons the whole
time

INT TUCKS HOUSE

Through the foyer window Tuck can be seen starting his
motorcycle and PEELING off

EXT LYNNS HOUSE

The happy clown looking over his shoulder back at the cop is
the first to see Shivers A giant axe in his hands

HAPPY CLOWN
Hey

Patrick turns just in time to see the descending axe blade
It takes him in the back of the neck almost decapitating
him His body falls onto the happy clown who starts
hyperventilating

Shivers spares him a look then starts to turn toward the
front door As if he has some sixth sense though his gaze is
caught on Hestons car

HESTON
has his mouth wide open Hes trying to sit very still

HESTON
Holy shit

The clown seems disturbed From this distance its hard to
tell if he can see Heston but he seems to be staring right
at him

Shivers turns suddenly stalking back the way he came

The happy clown has his eyes closed must be going into shock
or something Hyperventilating still

Hestons surprised by the sudden turn and takes a look up and
down the street Doesnt see any witnesses He reaches into
his canvas bag and grabs out a cheap rubber clown mask pulls
it over his head

He quickly pulls his car in front of Lynns house He gets
out of the car--one hand inside his jacket conceals the gun
from earlier--and hurries up the front walk

Past the dead cop and the pinned clown He runs smack into
the front door which surprises him by being locked He SLAMS
his shoulder into it
INSIDE

Lynns startled from her work by the BANG against her front
door She puts the brush down as theres another BANG

a

e bolts to her feet just as the third SLAM shatters the
lock and blows the door open Heston moves in fast kicking
the door shut behind him and stops to listen

From Lynns POV she saw the clown-masked intruder move past
the room shes in Shes terrified but stifles her scream
The man is not in her sight now

a

e looks around for a weapon anything but theres nothing
no help at all

Heston doesnt wait long Not hearing anything he assumes
shes upstairs asleep He quickly creeps up the stairs toward
her bedroom

Lynn didnt hear him go up the carpeted steps Quietly she
creeps to the edge of the wall peers around the corner Hes
not in sight

Did he go to the kitchen or up the stairs She eyes the door
Ten feet away and closed

She creeps out quietly reaching for doorknob keeping her
eyes darting back and forth between the upstairs and the
kitchen

Her hands on the knob when Heston comes out from the
bedroom His eyes widen inside the mask as he sees her at the
door

He FIRES without aiming

The bullet splinters a chunk out of the door but misses its
mark Lynn SCREAMS and runs toward the back of the house
toward the glass door

EXT LYNNS HOUSE

Tuck pulls up on his motorcycle and gets off He sees the

dead cop the clown pinned underneath him and leaps off his
motorcycle

As he runs to the house theres a GUNSHOT

INT LYNNS HOUSE

Heston FIRES AGAIN and rushes down the stairs after her
Lynn runs into the sliding glass door pulls it but its

locked she fiddles with the lock--both ways still wont
budge--she sees the stick wedged to keep it shut grabs it--
HESTON
HEY

She turns holding the stick in front of her like a sword
Shes terrified

Hestons there made all the more menacing by his clown mask

HESTON
Nothin personal lady Just
delivering a message from your
husband He says goodbye

He raises the gun level to her head

TUCK dives into Hestons back bearing him to the ground
Heston drops the gun to keep from slamming headfirst into the
carpet

Tuck struggles to keep control keep Heston down but
Hestons trying to get up get some leverage Theyre
grappling for control rolling and sliding across the floor
like a couple of high-school wrestlers

Neither one sees Lynn pick up the gun
INT BERTS HOUSEBEDROOM

In the background RUNNING WATER can be heard Bert pulls off
his shirt then massages his trapezius like his neck is
bothering him

He looks up at the KNOCK on his front door

He leaves his bedroom and heads for the front door He looks
through the peephole sees no one then opens the door

Theres no one there There is a van with tinted windows in
front of his next door neighbors house He looks at it but
it doesnt register

He goes back inside and shuts the door rubbing at his aching
neck some more

IN HIS BATHROOM

He steps into the steaming hot water lies back Its a
little cramped but he doesnt seem to mind He takes a
second to let the heat soak into his muscles

Then he reaches over the side of the bathtub and grabs his
book We can see that he left the bathroom door cracked open
slightly

He relaxes getting into the book Theres a CREAK from right
outside the bathroom door Bert lowers the book and looks
toward it
It must be his imagination but the door looks like its open
a little farther He goes back to reading Turns the page

Theres another creak but this time theres something
different Without lowering the book Bert can feel it

Theres a pregnant moment where he looks like hes not going
to lower the book and look But he finally does

The clown stands in the bathroom doorway the axe in hand
Bert looks like hes just run into a bear and doesnt know
whether to run or play dead

BERT
Now hold on a minute--

The clown rushes him jabbing the axe point viciously into
Bert as he tries to get up

Blood mixes into the water as the clown continues to stab
stab stab

INT LYNNS HOUSE

Heston jabs an elbow at Tucks head Tuck turns his head but
still takes it in the cheek hard Its enough to let him slip
out of Tucks grasp He turns to run--

--Lynn a distant look in her eye stands there pointing the
gun at him

Tuck stands up

HESTON
Ladyyou dont know how to use
that

Famous last words Lynn pulls the trigger Glass shatters
behind Heston He turns to look and sees a ruined picture
featuring a bullet hole

He turns back to her and smiles but the smile dies as he
feels something on his chest Blood is soaking his T-shirt

Heston has enough time to realize hes in a direct line
between the picture and the gun then the life fades from his
eyes He collapses sideways

Tuck is shocked Lynn cant seem to get her eyes off of
Hestons body

TUCK
Lynn Give me the gun

She turns her eyes from the dying man to Tuck Their strange
lack of depth gives Tuck cause for concern
TUCK
(reassuring)
Lynn

He holds his hand out After a moment she hands him the gun
DISSOLVE TO
EXT LYNNS HOUSE - LATER

Police cars are clustered in front of the house Lynn and

Tuck stand off to the side trying to stay out of the way

Theres an uncomfortable distance between them that Tucks
trying to figure a way into

TUCK
Heylisten I wanted to explain
about the magazines

He hopes shell say forget about it but she doesnt He goes
on

TUCK
Ive been a big art fan for years
all kinds and I first saw your
art in those mags When I heard
about the showing downtown I
thought it would be neat to see
some of your paintings up close

LYNN
You said you saw my picture in the
program

TUCK

I did Thats just not the only
place I saw your picture I didnt
want you to flip out and think I
was a stalker whichis probably
what youre thinking right about
now

Lynns noncommittal Detective Peters comes out of the house
and heads over to them He pulls Lynn away from Tuck so he
can talk to her privately

DETECTIVE PETERS
Well Helluva shot Miss Blodgett

LYNN

DETECTIVE PETERS

LYNN

LYNN

DETECTIVE PETERS

conversations with your husband
conversations where your husband
hired him to kill you

LYNN
No

DETECTIVE PETERS
Yep Plain old greed I guess
getting the hitman to dress up as
a clown must have been him being
creative Hell its as good a
disguise as any

LYNN
But he wasnt the clown I saw--

DETECTIVE PETERS
He probably changed outfits

LYNN
I dont think so

DETECTIVE PETERS
Are you positive

She thinks That night on the porch it happened to so fast
it was dark and she faintedshe just cant be sure

LYNN
He had makeup on when I saw him
DETECTIVE PETERS
Probably figured out a mask was
much less work Easier to take off

Hes got his mind made up and hes starting to convince her

LYNN
Why didnt he kill me that night
then After I fainted

DETECTIVE PETERS
Maybe he got scared off by your
friend on the phone Well never
know for sure
(waves it off)
You just take it easy Were
looking for your husband now

LYNN
You dont know where he is

DETECTIVE PETERS
We think hes on the run No sign
of him at his house Dont worry
about it well get him soon
Whatever you were asking for in
this divorce thingask for more
Youll get it

She nods realizing the implications for her and Nicholas No
way will they give custody to Bert now

DETECTIVE PETERS
If you have any other questions
give me a call
(hands her a card)
My home numberss on the back
Night or day doesnt matter

LYNN
Okay Thanks

He smiles reassuringly and leaves Tuck comes over
TUCK
I heard I think you should try
and get some sleep
Lynn nods but looks doubtful
TUCK
Can I give you a call tomorrow
When everythings more normal

again

She thinks it over decides she wants him to
LYNN
Okay I guess I could give you a
second chance seeing that you
saved my life and all
TUCK
(his smiles back)
Great
He gives her a quick hug gets on his cycle and rides off
Lynn turns back toward her house and watches the cops
waiting for them to finish their work
CUT TO
INT LYNNS HOUSE
Lynns in bed again tossing and turning

IN HER DREAM

A sterile white hall infinitely long People move in and
out of our sight all blurry out of focus As they clear out
we see a YOUNG BOY sitting on a bench

He looks at us sadly

YOUNG BOY
Dead Theyre all dead

He stands up and points a finger at us accusingly

YOUNG BOY
Theyre all dead

THE CLOWNs face pops into view staring right at us smiling
like a demon

LYNN

sits up in bed her heart racing Looks around starting to
get her bearings

She sees a clown doll sitting on her dresser that wasnt
there before Who could have put that there

All at once it begins to turn its head its eyes glaring a
malevolent red--

LYNN

sits up in bed for real this time looking immediately to her
dresser No clown doll there

She looks out the window the sun is coming up on a new day

INT GALLERY - DAY

Lynn Phillip and Mr Parrish are staring at a painting that
is propped on an easel in the middle of the room Mr Parrish
stares in wonder

MR PARRISH

We see the painting Its the one Lynn was working on of Mr
Parrishs father and it captures the look he wanted to
perfection Tears appear in his eyes

MR PARRISH

imagined I cant thank you enough

Phillip takes the painting off to wrap it Mr Parrish pulls
his checkbook out and begins writing He finishes signing
his name with a flourish

MR PARRISH

upon

LYNN
Twenty thousand

Mr Parrish nods he knew He hands her the check She takes
it without looking at it

MR PARRISH

Mr Parrish walks to the front door to where Phillip is
waiting with his painting

MR PARRISH

He takes his painting and leaves

PHILLIP

She smiles looking at the check

INT PHILLIPS - NIGHT

Phillip is busy in the kitchen making what looks to be an
elaborate meal He checks in one of his cabinets for noodles--
none there

He begins to go downstairs to get some but something in his
backyard catches his eye Theres someone out there standing
in the shadow of a tree

Phillip frowns From his vantage its hard to see anything

He goes back the way he came through his hall into his
bedroom Looks out the back window

Hes got a slightly better view but its still not great
The person almost looks likea clown Phillip draws back
away from the window frowning

He walks back into the hall and turns into the guest room on
the corner of his house One window faces the backyard while
another next to it faces the side of his house He looks out
the backyard window
Has to blink once The clown is gone UnlessPhillip tries
to peer around to see if the clown is behind the tree but it
doesnt look like it

Phillip leans back again and doesnt see the clown staring in
the side window at him

He turns to leave as the clown raises the axe swings it at
the window On the axe crashing through glass

INT MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

Tuck escorts Lynn into the theater Its huge covered wall
to wall in advertisements for movies

LYNN
Nice theater

TUCK
Only the best for you

LYNN
Will we be able to get popcorn

TUCK
With butter And a Coke

He winks like I got the hook-up

JEFF appears at the top of the stairs leading to the second
level

JEFF
Hey Tuck Im about ready Youre
gonna be in theater eight

TUCK
Great Thanks Were gonna grab
some concessions

JEFF
I can send Bobby down to do that

TUCK
No thats cool I know where

everything is

JEFF
Help yourself

He jogs back to the projection booth punching the code to
get through the door

Tuck motions Lynn to follow him behind the concession booth
INT STAIRWELL

A thin set of concrete steps runs down to a steel door all
bathed dimly yellow by the auxillery lights

The clown makes his way slowly up the steps
one hand A canvas bag in his other hand THUMP THUMPING with
every step

Something short and thin is inside the bag
moving Something that looks like a small body

INT MOVIE THEATERCONCESSION

The giant axe in

and its not

A bucket of popcorn sits on the counter next to the soda
Tuck is filling two cups at the same time

fountain

LYNN
Youre like an expert If I didnt
know better Id swear youve done
that before

TUCK
Burger King when I was in high
school Its a lost art

LYNN
You know I worked at a theater
when I was in high school Didnt
last two months

TUCK
They dont know what they lost

He lets off of the taps at the same time Bo
identically filled He waits until the foam goes away and
finishes filling them

He pops a top on them and hands her one

TUCK
Ready

LYNN
(suddenly occurs to
her)
What are we seeing

TUCK

I was thinking some scary horror
movie where youd have to snuggle
close to me but given the past
couple of days

(shrugs)
I opted for a sappy love movie
instead

th sodas are
LYNN
Good choice

They head toward the auditorium
INT PROJECTION ROOM

Jeff is carrying the reel of film--its the entire movie
rolled together and its so big he cant even see around it
He slides it onto a platter and threads it through the
projector

BOBBY a pimply teen pops out of the bathroom and shouts
down

BOBBY
Im gonna go make sure the doors
are all locked up

JEFF
Okay

Bobby disappears out the door as Jeff finishes threading the
film

As he stands up movement at the far end of the projection
booth catches his eye

He squints Its hard to tell Small pools of light at each
projector are the only illumination Most of the room is in
darkness

Stillsomethings off The shape isnt right at the far end
Jeff makes his way slowly toward the end

Hes twenty feet away from the spot when the clown steps out
of the shadow The only thing in his hand is the axe but
its shadowed in the darkness behind a film platter

JEFF
(jumps)
Hey
(relieved for a
moment)
Scared the shit out of me

Then he realizes--its late at night and theres a clown in
his projection booth It dawns on him Someones playing a

joke

JEFF
Did Bobby put you up to this

The clown takes a step toward him

CLOWN
Shell pay

JEFF
This aint cool man You cant be
up here This is--

The clown takes another step splashing a shaft of light onto
the axe blade

JEFF
Woah
(steps back)
Ill get Bobby for you

He takes another step The clown raises the axe Jeff turns
to run panic growing on his face

The clown hurls the axe It spins twice and smacks solidly
into the back of Jeffs head He drops

The clown moves to him and grasps the haft of his axe He
tugs at it pulling Jeffs head from the ground but the axe
doesnt come out

He has to put one foot on Jeffs head and with a vicious
yank rips it free He doesnt bother wiping it off as he
moves toward the door

The clown moves to the small window that looks down into the

theater He can see Tuck and Lynn seated in the middle of the
auditorium

INT AUDITORIUM

Tuck picks that moment to look back From his vantage point

the shape is too dark behind the window for him to recognize

Thinking its Jeff he waves

The clown backs away from the window

TUCK
I think hes getting ready to
start it

LYNN
Good This is a little past my
bedtime

TUCK

Im glad you came out I wasnt
sure you would you know given

LYNN
(nods)
Might be good for me to see a
movie forget it all for a couple
of hours
TUCK
(nods)
Thats the right attitude Whos

him for a while anyway
CUT TO
INT JULIES HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The kitchens a wreck The table is flipped on its side and
papers and a bowl of fruit are scattered on the floor

MOVING
to the phone jack a wire plugged into it FOLLOWING the cord
we see the cradle of the phone and a spiral-cord trailing
off
to the phone A hand clutches it limply We follow the
hand past the bracelet up the arm to where it ends at the
shoulder The arm is no longer attached to a body but cut
cleanly at the top
MOVING
across the floor now marred with puddles of blood to where
Julie lies butchered Her face other than spatters of blood
is untouched but her body is in pieces

CUT TO
INT MOVIE THEATER - CONTINUOUS

Bobbys testing the doors to make sure theyre all locked and
wont open without a key even from the inside

That taken care of he hops the concession counter and turns
off the frozen drink machines He heads through the back and

comes out at the rear concession entrance

He takes a step toward the stairs but stops and makes a
sudden decision to head into the bathroom

WHISTLING no particular tune he enters a stall and unzips
not bothering to shut the door

The clowns boots on the tile floor dont make enough noise
to alert Bobby

Bobbys done pissing and shakes

The clown stands right behind him outside of the stall
Bobby tucks himself back in his pants and is about to turn
when the clown RAMS the axe point through his back throwing
the helpless teen against the wall in front of him Something
majors been hit blood is running out of his chest like a
river

His strength leaving Bobby falls to one knee over the
toilet The clown JERKS the axe out of him and without the
support Bobby collapses completely

The clown turns Listens
INT AUDITORIUM
Tuck and Lynn are getting a little antsy

TUCK
If this takes much longer Im
gonna demand my money back

She smiles

LYNN
What do you think the hold up is

Tuck shrugs that he doesnt know

A HOLLOW SOUND muffled seems to come from the entrance to
the auditorium

TUCK
Whats he doing now

The clown walks slowly into the auditorium Hes completely
out of sight of Lynn and Tuck until he rounds about the
third row of seats hell be out of sight behind the concrete
wall that supports the stadium seating

TUCK

(joking)
Im gonna have to speak to a
manager if you dont start the
movie Jeff

No expression from the clown

Tuck is looking at Lynn when the clown rounds the first row
of seats Shes looking right at the clown and the look on
her face is enough to wipe the smile off of his

The question forms on his face but he turns to look and
sees

The clown has stopped at the foot of the first stair He
holds the bloody axe in both hands
LYNN
No

CLOWN
Youre gonna pay

Tuck stands pulling a terrified Lynn to her feet Tuck grabs
his soda but keeps an eye on the clown

The clown mounts the stairway one at a time No hurry

Tuck pushes Lynn behind him backing her down the aisle away
from the clown By the time the clown is on the same aisle
level as they are hes at one end and theyre at the other

The clown considers this He takes a step forward Tuck
pushes Lynn down a step The clown backs up Tuck doesnt
move

TUCK
Move slowly down the stairs

Lynn almost dazed does Instead of following Tuck moves up
a stair The clown doesnt even look at him Focused entirely
on Lynn watching her like a cat about to pounce

TUCK
Hey

Tuck doesnt even exist to the clown

TUCK
(to Lynn)
Wait

She stops The moment hangs all three staring at one
another Lynn and the clown as if in a trance Tucks mind
racing with indecision

TUCK
RUN

He throws his soda at the clown and runs down the stairs
toward Lynn The sodas a great throw It gets the clowns
attention something coming at him from his peripheral
vision He bats it away with his axe then crosses through
the aisle in pursuit of the fleeing couple

Lynn and Tuck burst out the auditorium door Tuck thinking
quickly overturns the large trash can in front to block the
door

TUCK
Come on

He grabs her hand and pulls her toward the front doors They
smack into them and cant understand why they dont open
Theyre just push-lever doors but they dont realize Bobby
has locked them with a key

THE CLOWN

has run into the auditorium door which is jammed shut by the
trash can He kicks at the door

TUCK

runs to the single door to the side of the main entrances and
tries to open it No joy there either

LYNN
Break them

TUCK
With what Its reinforced safety
glass

Tuck hears the sound of the DOOR hitting the TRASHCAN as the
clown kicks it

TUCK
Come on

He grabs her hand and heads down the side corridor leading
back toward the theaters

THE CLOWN

has kicked the door enough that the trash can no longer jams
it He slides out and strides toward the front

Tuck and Lynn emerge through the corridor door right back in
front of the auditorium entrances Tuck cautiously goes right
back to the theater they came from

He opens the door as wide as he can without hitting the trash
can lets Lynn slide in and he follows

THE CLOWN

stands in the lobby where Tuck and Lynn were moments before
Hes listening but theres no sound

His gaze travels from the glass doors to the concession
stand Considering Back to the doors

A table next to the concession stand has paper and pens for
entering a contest The clown goes to it propping his bloody
axe on top while he grabs a sheet of paper and a pen

He begins writing

INT DETECTIVE PETERS HOUSE - SAME TIME
Peters is in shorts T-shirt and socks Hes putting together
a puzzle at his kitchen table It looks to be about 10000
pieces but hes doing pretty good

COMPUTER (0OS)
Thrill me

Peters puts down the puzzle piece hes holding and goes to
his computer He clicks a couple of buttons and his email
pops up displaying the message NEW EMAIL

Peters is getting interested now He reads on and something

He hangs up but looks worried

IN THE AUDITORIUM

Tuck rushes Lynn up the stairs to the door at the top He
peers through the small window--coast looks clear--then leads

the way through

Theyre on the second floor a small level overlooking the
front lobby A stairway leads down the front

Tuck moves to the projection-room door and pulls on it Its
locked a numeric keypad is set into the wall

LYNN
(whisper)
Knock on it

TUCK
Too loud Hes got his radio on in

there anyway

Tuck tries a combination pulls gently Still locked He
tries another pulls again Locked

Lynn takes a look at the keypad Five numbers
LYNN
Are you kidding Theres a hundred

and twenty combinations

TUCK
You have another idea

He keeps trying
DOWNSTAIRS

The clown stands in the center of the lobby Whatever he did
with the paper theres no sign of it now

Hes listening The sound of Tuck trying combinations can
barely be heard and from the lobby its hard to know where
its coming from

The clown hefts his axe and walks back toward the
auditoriums passing the stairwell to the second floor He
suddenly stops though realizing the sound is coming from
above him

He backtracks and begins climbing the stairs

ABOVE
Lynn has moved to the top of the stairs and is peering down
them Suddenly the top of the clowns head comes into her
sightline but because of the angle he doesnt see her
She rushes back to Tuck
LYNN
(harsh whisper)
Hes coming
Tucks still trying combos Nothings working
TUCK
If he gets to the top run back
into the theater
He keeps going
THE CLOWN
is halfway up the stairs He can definitely hear them now
The paint smile on his face seems to widen His stride
however doesnt quicken
AT THE TOP
Lynns petrified watching the stairs with her back against
the wall Anticipating the appearance of her deepest fear

brought to life

And appear he does Slowly inevitably his head appears
then his axe Step by step hes almost to the top

LYNN
Hes here

Tuck looks quickly goes back to the codes As the clown gets
to the top step the door surprises all three of them by
opening to Tucks pull

They dart in to the projection room as the clown rushes at
them Tuck pulls the door shut just in time as the clown
slams into it

The clown pulls on the door but its locked again

INT PROJECTION ROOM

Lynn and Tuck take a breather Safe for the moment

TUCK

see that she thinks its going to be dead but its not Like
a prayer answered shes got a dial tone

She hits 911

He leads her toward the door the clown originally came in He
stops suddenly

TUCK
Wait here

LYNN

TUCK

Hes been here

He tries to block her view but she sees anyway Jeff sits
his back against the door Blood glistens all over him and
his eyes are wide open forever staring at nothing

LYNN
Is the door open

Tuck gently moves Jeffs body out of the way then tries the
door Doesnt move He throws himself against it but it
still doesnt budge

Lynn begins searching through Jeffs pants

TUCK
What are you doing

LYNN
Looking for keys

Tucks surprised by her initiative you dont see him going
through the dead guys pants She finishes coming up empty

TUCK

EXT MOVIE THEATER

Four patrol cars with flashing lights are parked in front of
the theater as Detective Peters pulls up in his unmarked

One OLDER COP hurries over to intercept Peters

DETECTIVE PETERS
Detective Peters homicide

Peters sees it refrains from cursing

OLDER COP

DETECTIVE PETERS

The older cops shrugs Nothing he can do Peters knows it too

DETECTIVE PETERS
Dammit

He stares in through the glass impotently
INT MOVIE THEATER
Tuck and Lynn rush back to the phone
TUCK

Tell them were trapped in the

projection room
Lynn picks up the phone which she left off the hook Tucks
looking around for a weapon The best he finds is a broom
with detachable end He unscrews it and is left with a five-

foot pole

LYNN
Hello Hello

She clicks the hang-up button a couple of times

LYNN
The lines dead
INTERCUT

The junction box where all the phone lines come in and go
out Theyre hanging out of the box like stray hair having
been ripped out

BACK TO SCENE

TUCK
You have your cel phone

LYNN
(shakes her head)
Its in my car You

TUCK
Didnt want anyone to get in touch
with me tonight Okay no problem
We can wait it out here The cops
should be here any minute Well
just wait

Lynn moves to a group of doors if only to keep herself busy
The one on the left has a restroom sign on it The other two
doors have nothing on them

LYNN
Where do these go

Tuck comes over and shrugs Then he KICKS one door
shattering the lock and throwing it open He reaches in and
flicks on the light

TUCK
(answering her
question)

Managers office

They check out the room Lynn confirms the phones dont work
in this room either Tucks interested in a giant monitor
with buttons on it

The monitor shows different parts of the theater every
camera in the building is patched into it

Tuck pushes a button and the view switches to one particular
camera He pushes another and it moves to another camera

TUCK
Take a look at this
(she does)
Security cameras

Tuck pushes button after button searching for any sign of
the clown He doesnt seem to be on any of the cameras
LYNN
Where is he

Tuck hits the button that shows all sixteen cameras at one
time Two of the monitors show the outside parking lot which
has police cars and officers all around

TUCK
Look The cops are here

Lynn smiles with relief but the smile dies as she realizes
something

LYNN
What are they waiting for Why
arent they coming in

Tuck sees what she means The cops seem to be taking up siege
positions

TUCK
UhI dont know Unless they
think hes got us hostage

LYNN
So were on our own

Now that its been said out loud it starts to sink in Tuck
tries to be optimistic

TUCK
Dont worry Were safe here

The sound of METAL HITTING PLEXIGLASS makes Lynn jump It
happens AGAIN

TUCK
Oh shit He can reach the
projection window from the smaller
theaters

LYNN
Can he get through

TUCK
»-I dont know

WHACK Then silence Lynn and Tuck move out of the room and
wait in the center of the aisle staring down past the
projectors into the darkness Expecting the clown to appear

Then WHACK
After a moment of silence Tuck leads Lynn slowly toward

where the sound came from Bracing for the next slam but the
silence drags
They approach the window looking down into the theater Very
slow Like the clowns face is going to appear suddenly

It doesnt but what they see in the theater takes Lynns
breath away Shock Fear Hopelessness Its all reflected in
her expression

TUCK
(sotto voce)
Oh shit

The clown stands in front of the theater screen his axe
gripped in his left hand His right hand rests on the
shoulder of Nicholas who stands there in a daze For some
reason the boy doesnt seem to be afraid

The clown sees them in the window He looks at Nicholas then
back to Lynn and Tuck His look says everything The boy for
you

TUCK
Ill distract him You get Nicky
out of there

The shock seems to have focused Lynn

LYNN
No Hell kill you

Lynns sudden calmness worries Tuck

TUCK
Hey Im not gonna let anything
happen to either of you

LYNN
Im okay Im okay
(reassuring smile)
Im going out there but I need you
to do something for me

TUCK
(cant believe it)
Youre what

LYNN
Im tiredIm tired of being
scared And I wont let him hurt
my son Now listen to me

INT AUDITORIUM

The clown stares at the now-empty window into the projection
room Nickys having a hard time keeping his eyes open

LYNN (0S)
All right

The clown turns Lynn stands at the foot of the theater
Defiant and angry but its impossible for her to completely
conceal her fear

LYNN
Im here Let him go

The clown turns Sees her He smiles but its a gruesome
sadistic smile made even more hideous by his makeup He
releases the boy

LYNN
Come here Nicky

He does Lynn kneels down in front of him keeping her eyes
on the clown

LYNN
(quiet)
Nicky I want you to go outside
and wait for me Understand

He nods

LYNN
Go on

He walks out casting one glance back at his mother
When hes gone the clown takes a step toward Lynn

LYNN
Wait
(the clown stops)
Why are you doing this What do
you want

CLOWN
To getbetter

He moves to the aisle Lynn moves into a row of seats to keep
as much distance as possible between them

LYNN
But why me

CLOWN
It was your fault

One step at a time the clown comes up Lynn backs up until
shes at the foot of the other aisle She backs her way
farther up the stairs as the clown begins to cross the row

Shes half-way up when he gets to the foot of the aisle
leading up to her Gaining ground even though hes not
rushing

He puts a foot on the stair Lynns not moving Too petrified
to moveor waiting

The clown takes another step his grip on the axe tightening

LYNN
Wait

The clown stops Lynns terrified trying to hide it
Desperate Hoping this works

Without turning her own head she points back toward the
projection booth

LYNN
Look

Instinctually the clown does

A blinding BEAM OF LIGHT streaks out of the projector
redirected at the clown Its a broad beam 30000 candle-
watts of power full in the face

He YELLS IN PAIN turning away but too late Hes blinded
maybe permanently Lynn shields her eyes and slides her way
across the row of seats

Still averting her eyes from the light she accidentally
kicks over a soda The clown hears it YELLS ANGRILY He
climbs the stairs to her level and moves in her direction
trying to hone in on the sound He swings the axe in front of
him even though hes not close to her

The projector light is no longer following him Lynns
frozen watching as the clown feels his way across the seats

Coming closer Lynn moves away accidentally kicking ice from
the soda she just knocked down The ice makes TIC TIC sounds
as it falls to the next level

The clown now knowing hes on the right track starts to
move quickly toward her through the row

Lynn turns and runs The clown follows stumbling against the
seats in his blind chase

Her shoes now wet Lynn slips as she tries to cut out of the
aisle crashes against the wall She turns--the clown stands
above her his axe raised to deliver the killing blow--

TUCK (OS)
Hey

The clown turns toward the voice He cant see it but Tucks
holding a broom handle like a baseball bat
Tuck swings for the fences The pole splinters in half as it
THWACKS into the clowns forehead He falls back against the
stairs

Tuck pulls Lynn to her feet and pushes her ahead of him He
turns to look back at the clown

Amazingly the clown is already standing the axe raised over
his head for a huge swipe at Tuck Tucks got nowhere to go
In desperation he lunges at the clown and grasps the axe
handle as it starts its downward arc

He manages to stop it but he has to hold on for dear life
The clown is much stronger than he is and now can feel him
The clown releases one hand from the axe and grabs Tuck by
the throat

With an iron grip the clown begins to choke him Tuck
desperately grasps out like the clown his hand grabbing at
the clowns throat

He squeezes but the clown doesnt seem bothered Just cocks
his head slightly and continues to choke the life out of Tuck

Tuck pushes the axe to the side and SLUGS the clown in the
face The clown is stunned for a second Tuck PUNCHES him
again It seems to have the opposite effect and brings the
clown out of his daze

The clown swings the axe with his left hand in a swipe meant
to cut Tuck in half at the stomach

Tuck barely catches it again The clowns getting pissed
Hes still got a grip on Tucks neck and he uses it to throw
Tuck to the ground

He takes his wood-chopping grip and raises the axe for a
massive swing

DETECTIVE PETERS (0S)

The clown turns his head to the new threat Detective Peters
and two cops stand at the entry to the auditorium and every
one of them has a gun pointed at him

The clown turns back to Tuck a hateful sneer on his face He
looks like hes gonna chop him anyway Peters finger
tightens on the trigger

DETECTIVE PETERS
DONT

The clown looks back to the cops The tension finally relaxes
from his grip He throws the axe to the ground
Peters motions the cops over to the clown and doesnt take
his sights off until hes securely cuffed He goes over to
Tuck

DETECTIVE PETERS
Jesus

He extends a hand to Tuck and helps him up
DETECTIVE PETERS
That is the biggest fucking clown
I have ever seen
DISSOLVE TO

INT MOVIE THEATER -LATER
Lynn hugging Nicky protectively and Tuck are in the lobby
of the theater again strobed by flashing red and blue lights

from the police cars outside

Detective Peters finishes talking to some of the cops and
joins them a grim look on his face

DETECTIVE PETERS
How you holding up

LYNN
Were okay What about Julie

DETECTIVE PETERS
Shes dead Im sorry

Tuck tries to comfort Lynn by putting his arm around her For
a moment the three almost look like a family Peters notices
this and seems to feel a little awkward shifts uncomfortably

DETECTIVE PETERS
The paramedics are going to need
to take Nicholas to the hospital
for a while Just do a few tests
You can ride in the ambulance if
you want
She nods shock setting in

TUCK
Ill follow you

They follow Peters outside toward the flashing lights
DISSOLVE TO
INT LYNNS CAR - NIGHT

Lynn dead tired on her way home from the hospital Nicholas
is asleep in the passenger seat Theres a BEEP from the back
seat

At first Lynn doesnt notice it It BEEPS again and she
remembers her cel phone in the back seat She grabs it and
sees she has a message

She dials her voice mail and listens

VOICE MAIL OPERATOR
Today two thirty-four am

PHILLIP (PHONE)
(weak barely audible)
LynnLynn
The line goes dead Lynn looks at her car clock 332
Lynn has a terrible thought What if the clown went to
Phillips like he did to Julies She dials the phone gets
a BUSY signal

LYNN
Oh noPhillip

She turns down a side street headed toward Phillips

EXT PHILLIPS - NIGHT

Not many lights on at Phillips house Lynn looks at Nicky
still asleep then back to Phillips Nothing looks amiss

Phillip could be asleep Maybe it was nothing

She locks the car doors and heads up the walkway At the
front door she pauses Its open a crack

LYNN
Oh no

She pushes the door open dreading what shes about to see
while dialing 911 on her cel phone

INSIDE

The place is trashed Chairs and tables overturned Pictures
ripped from the walls

Lynn makes herself go in

LYNN
Phillip Please

She moves in completely expecting to find Phillips body
the phone in her hand forgotten Bracing herself for what
shes about to find

PHILLIP (0OS)
Lynn
She cant believe it She starts to move toward his voice
but stops when she sees him Hes standing in the hall his
back to her Somethings not right though

PHILLIP
I heard it on the police scanner

LYNN
Phillip what

Phillip turns but the face that meets her is nightmarish

His face is roughly painted like he did it himself He looks
like the shark-toothed clown from one of her paintings Lynn
recoils confused

Not really scared Yet

PHILLIP
He didnt kill you I had my
doubts he wasnt the brightest
bulb was he I think he actually
believed it was his parents that
your dad drove off the road

LYNN
Whatwhat are you talking about

Phillip strolls into the kitchen

PHILLIP
Im not one for long explanations
Suffice it to say Ive been
keeping my eye on you for a long
time now Over twenty years There
was a time I thought I could
simply forget what you did

He pulls a large butcher knife out of the drawer and holds it
up inspecting its edge

PHILLIP
Of course that didnt last And
nownow youre going to move
away You think you can get away
from me now

Hes moving slowly around the room Discretely putting
himself closer to the door

LYNN
I dont understandwhat--why are
you dressed like that

PHILLIP
I see it like it was yesterday I
was twelve Sitting on the bench
in the waiting area Doctors
rushing aroundhurt sick people
everywhere That awful smell

Hes rambling staring at the blade mesmerized by his
reflection maybe but now hes closer to the front door than
Lynn is

PHILLIP
And what I keep remembering--it
haunts me in my sleep--was those
policemen who walked by
(mimics one)
The little girl she distracted
him Drove right into them

Then his gaze locks on her She doesnt know what hes
talking about

PHILLIP
I knew Bert you know He treated
me for years Thats how I met
Doug--the clown He was so nuts
that it didnt take much to
convince him that killing you
would make him all better Of
course he was a loaded gun He
came after me tonight butI
straightened him out

His expression goes grim Lynn cant absorb it doesnt
understand any of it

PHILLIP
Dont worry you can ask your dad
what Im talking about when you
visit him in hell

He raises the blade and rushes at her She stumbles back
shoving a tall lamp in his way He trips over it and falls
catching himself at the last second He regains a measure of
his dignity brushing at his pants as he stands

It might be funny if it werent for the huge knife in his
hand

Lynns trying to stay cool even though shes deathly
frightened of the way Phillip looks the clown makeup
covering his face

LYNN
Phillip Listen to me Im your
friend I want to help you

PHILLIP
Do you
LYNN
Yes

PHILLIP
Then pleaselet me stab you

He feints her way her again She dodges around the side of
the sofa

LYNN
Phillip--

PHILLIP
Stop calling me that My name is
Shane

They are circling each other the sofa a barrier between them

PHILLIP
Would you like to know why youre
so afraid of clowns

She does but she says nothing

PHILLIP

At the hospital some vapid nurse
told you your parents were never
coming back so you started crying
There was a clown at the hospital
trying to cheer up the kids that
day andhe came up behind you
and touched your shoulder I guess
he was trying to make you smile
Butyou saw him and wouldnt
stop screaming bloody murder

(beat)
Isnt it interesting how that one
moment has shaped the rest of your
life

LYNN
And youve beenfollowing me all
these years

PHILLIP
Yes

Lynns expression says just how nuts that is

LYNN
And Amanda Julie Even Nicky

PHILLIP
FUCK you Lynn What about my
parents What about ME
LYNN
What about you

She surprises him by moving a little closer her face showing
sympathy and kindness

LYNN
Phillipyoure nuts

She punches him square in the face Hes shocked and hurt
falls back on his ass as blood starts to gush from his nose

Lynn turns and runs
OUTSIDE

She rushes to the car fumbling at her keyring for the car
key She gets to her door still sorting through her keys and
naturally she drops them

Phillip bursts out the door furious He sees her car that
shes not in it He turns to look the other direction as she
stands up with the right key in her hand

He hears turns toward her Too late--shes unlocked the door
and slid in He rushes over as the car starts leaping on the
hood as if he can stop her from getting away

In reverse she guns it
Phillip slides off and hits the driveway painfully Lynn has

braked her car short of the road She puts it in park Stares
at Phillip as he slowly stands up

She looks at Nicky in the back seat still asleep
Somethings going through her mind but its hard to tell what
it is

Phillip is walking toward the car now Twenty feet away
Lynn puts her hand on the shift lever Takes a good look at

the letters RDN 1 2 3 Reverse takes her away from the
nightmare walking toward her

Phillip is fifteen feet away and closing
Lynn pulls the lever down Was it one click or two
She stomps on a pedal and her car surges forward Phillip has

time to raise the knife before the car hits him tossing him
back into the yard like a rag doll

She checks on Nicky--still buckled up and unbelievably still
asleep Back to front where Phillip lies in an unmoving heap

Lynn lays her head on the steering wheel in utter exhaustion
as SIRENS can be heard approaching
FADE TO BLACK
FADE IN
INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

The PHONE RINGS and Lynn bolts upright in bed She
it off the hook

LYNN

DETECTIVE PETERS (PHONE)
Lynn Thank God you answered I
dont want you to panic--

LYNN

DETECTIVE PETERS

DETECTIVE PETERS

Doug Richardson--the clownhe
escaped from the prison Im sure
hes headed out of state as fast
as he can go but Im sending men
over there just to be safe I want
you to stay calm

LYNN
When

DETECTIVE PETERS
Were not sure we--

Shes already put the phone down and is moving down
toward Nicholas room Detective Peters keeps talkin
his voice soon fades away to nothing

the locks Still locked the security chain latched

Relieved she moves back to Nicholas room His door
closed and pitch dark inside

She pushes the door open but its still too dark to
Nicholas bed

Lynn flicks on the light

She passes Nicholas room and goes to the front door

snatches

the hall
g but

Checks

is half-

see
The light comes on for an instant and immediately blows out
But in the snapshot flash Lynn sees the clown standing in
front of her sons bed looking down on him and at the flick
of the switch the clown begins to turn her way

The room is pitch-black before their eyes can meet

Lynns fear is all-consuming She unwittingly moves back
against the wall staring into the dark gaping hole into her
sons room so suddenly a mouth into madness

Too paralyzed to scream Lynn stares into the darkness
waiting for the clown to appear

CLOSE ON THE DOORWAY

At any second the clowns horrid face will loom out of the
black like a floating head leering at her

CLOSE ON LYNN

Lynns lip trembles She cant blink Fear grips her every
muscle

CLOSER ON THE DOORWAY

BLACK - ROLL CREDITS
