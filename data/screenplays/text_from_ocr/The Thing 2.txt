THE MAIN COMPOUND OF US OUTPOST 31
The interior is a cramped and never ending maze of

passageways and doors which connect the many rooms and
compartments within the compound Sturdy but

materials have been used in its construction

There is a laboratory An infirmary A kitchen and mess
A communications room and sleeping quarters Other

are for storage and supplies

The most spacious area of the building and the main

of activity is the Rec Room Of the many entrance ways
this room can be seen the small work chambers with
sophisticated computers and other scientific equipment

to his

electronic chess game A large Mexican sombrero hangs
on his

back He is tall about thirty-five His shack is
sparse but

unkempt A few centerfolds on the wall are interspersed
by
an occasional poster of some Mediterranean or South

American
paradise
The chess game is of larger than normal size The
pieces
move automatically with the press of a button He sits
down
and chuckles over his opponents bad move

Poor little son of a bitch Youre
starting to lose it arent you

response
is immediate

There
is a pounding at his door MacReady broods for a bit
heedless

of his visitor and makes his next move

More impatient pounding MacReady glares at his

opponent for

a beat He bends forward opens up a flap containing
the

chess games circuitry and pours in his drink There
ensues

a snapping popping sound as smoke and sparks rise from
the

machine followed by a flush of chess gibberish

Whatever that Norwegian dog was
It It was capable of changing its
form
(indicates their dog)
when it attacked our dog it
somehow was able to digest or
absorb it and in the process shaped

its own cells to imitate our dogs
cells exactly

leg)
This for instance isnt dog at
all -- its imitation We got to
it before it had time to finish or

NAULS
Finish what

BLAIR
I think the whole process would
have taken an hour maybe more

And then I suppose both would have
changed back to dog form

PALMER
Well that Thing in the ice sure
werent no dog

BLAIR

Of course not But whatever it was
revived it Well The Thing was
probably disoriented and realized
it couldnt survive for long in our
atmosphere But being the incredibly
adaptable creature it was it tried
to become something that could
Before the Norwegians killed it

it somehow got to this dog

It was a life form that was able to
imitate and reproduce whatever it
ate or absorbed cell for cell

become one dog It could have become

NORRIS
Can there be some kind of test
To find out whos what

DR COPPER
A serum test possibly

FUCHS
Right Why not

GARRY
Whats that

DR COPPER
Its a simple blood typing test
This Things blood chemistry is
different than ours Basically we
mix someones blood with
uncontaminated human blood If we
dont get the proper serum reaction --
then that person isnt human

CHILDS
Whose uncontaminated blood we going
to use

DR COPPER

Weve got blood plasma in storage

this

Ah no one I give it to Copper
when he needs it

MACREADY
Could anyone have gotten it from
you

DR COPPER
I dont see how when Im finished

I return it right away

NORRIS
When was the last time you used it

DR COPPER

A day or so ago I guess

Garry senses the nervous and inquiring eyes on him

someone might have lifted it from
me But

Sleet and hail send Nauls rolling in from the outside
men force the door back and lock it

The weary Nauls kneels on the floor and gasps for air
The others surround him

Nauls weighs each of them ominously while digging down
underneath his heavy jacket

NAULS
Cut him loose of the line up by his
shack

When we were up poking around his
place I found this
He pulls out a thick bundle of heavy clothing It is
mutilated

and partially burned He holds out the jacket to show
the

Close on name tag -- it reads RJ MACREADY The men
as
they examine in a hush

It was stashed in his old coal

on the stereo

SANCHEZ

SANCHEZ
I cant hear you

INT REC ROOM
MacReady cursing rips the speakers off the wall

MACREADY
What are they doing out there

The music is now subdued within the room but continues
booming throughout the camp Nauls scream can be

heard

GARRY
Whats he saying

INT KITCHEN - NAULS
at the top of his lungs

NAULS
MacReady We been cut off

A sharp red talon-like fingernail pierces the top of
door above Nauls head It saws downward quickly
Black goo drips through the slit The sawing obscured
music

Sanchez eyes bulging points Nauls turns A claw rips
through the wood Nauls dives to the floor

In the opposite direction behind Sanchez another arm

through the

and

through the door and the refrigerator extends itself
feet and yanks Sanchez back as if he were a puppet
Sanchez struggles looking imploringly at Nauls He

down on his capsule Nauls takes off like a speed

INT REC ROOM
The sound of the screeching over the music

MACREADY
Got to get to the generator

He opens the door Looks down the hall No one The
blaring music

NAULS

full speed down the maze Left Right Totally

hits a straightaway

SANCHEZS BODY

from out of nowhere blasts through the hallway wall
in Nauls path A thick arm pins the body to the other
Unable to stop Nauls skids out of control banging
sides of the wall his cyanide capsule flying out of
mouth

Whatever the rest of it is it starts to crumble

wall Nauls dives over the arm somersaults to his feet
takes off

INT MAIN HALL

MacReady running spots Nauls careening out of a turn
heading toward him

NAULS
Get back
MACREADY
The generator

NAULS
Screw the generator

Nauls blazes by him MacReady hears the snarls and

screeches
heading his way He streaks after Nauls
INT REC ROOM
They make it in Lock the door MacReady tries to
catch
his breath Nauls shakes pants
NAULS
Got Sanchez World War Three
wouldnt mess with this fucker
Can go through walls And its
like all over the place
MACREADY
Calm down and get in your position
NAULS
Position my ass
Garry fiddles with the two generators
GARRY
Im going to bump this up much as I
can
NAULS
Boulder Dam might do it
The loud music in the compound is turned off MacReady
shuts
off the lights The men spread out Silence

Whispers

Little over two hours

NAULS
Maybe it aint coming

MACREADY
Then we go after him

NAULS
Bet the last place you ever go

The sound of a door opening and closing Far off
Another creaking door is opened A rustling Still far
MacReady and Nauls spread further apart

The soft bubbling cooling sound A slight scratch at
door Garrys hand tightens around the generator

The scratching gets more pronounced MacReady cautions
with a whisper

MACREADY
Wait

The door begins to pound from the outside Nauls and
light two cocktails each

The door booms The rooms foundations shake The
quivers The gas bombs are cocked

From the roof The Thing roars down into their midst
Stunned the men stumble back MacReady throws his gas
Nauls the same

For a moment it stands silhouetted in flame Enormous
Grotesque

Garry bolts for the main door The Things tongue
from his mouth and spears him The good two-thirds of

body follows its tongue and engulfs Garry by the door

finally

one

Another leg slaps Nauls to the ground MacReady dodges
another appendage dives on the generators and throws
switch

The current rips through the door Garry dies

One of The Things talons still caught in the door
it writhing in pain It literally rips the door from
latchings and pounds it to the ground trying to shake
loose Nauls hobbles scrambles out of the opening

MacReady dives through the window and out into the

INT COMPOUND - HALL

The distant sound of a motor Nauls battered and

his leg apparently broken crawls along the ground
sound a bubbling and gurgling is heard well to his
But closing

The terror forces him to drag faster oblivious to the
He reaches the bathroom stall Crawls in Locks it The
gurgling nears Leaning on the toilet seat he looks
himself frantically

The Presence pauses at the door A scratching Nauls
rips at a cracked and weathered slab of wood cutting
fingers as he tries to break it off the siding

A strong blow begins to breach the stall door Nauls

unhinges the piece of wood brings the jagged end to
explode The

INT LAB WALL
The motorized rumbling nears The wall seems to
tractor barrels into the lab Its enormous shovel
tearing half the room to shreds
MacReady drives His eyes glint like a wild mans he
stark raving mad
His frostbite now in an advanced stage resembles
paint He clenches a stick of dynamite between his
like a buccaneers cutlass Two large compressed air
have been tied together at the top and are draped
neck They are marked -- HYDROGEN
They are used for the weather balloons
He pulls the tractor to a stop yanks the stick from
mouth grins and bellows
MACREADY

Okay creep Just you and me now Be

on your toes Were going to do a

little remodeling
MacReady guns it through the next wall and into the
Medical equipment goes flying The machine is powerful
prefabricated walls buckling under its force
INT COMPOUND
A trail of viscous yellow ooze leads around a bend
Boom

MacReady rams into the mess hall sweeping away tables
chairs He sings out loud the lyrics of some Mexican

All the while he keeps his eyes on everything
Through the kitchen The foundation is crumbling He
sings
on

NARROW PASSAGEWAY

Gurgling and hissing A taloned arm slinks around a
corner
in retreat

MACREADY (0S)
Chime in if you know that words old
boy

MACREADY

plows through several more rooms before ending up in
the pub

area He backs it up and retrieves a bottle of liquor
from

the bar

MACREADY
You like whiskey Come on join me
for a drink Be good for you Grow
fangs on your chest

He takes a drink and rams through another wall

INT REC ROOM

The tractor blazes into the rec room MacReady parks it

directly in front of the hole in the roof created by
The

Thing when it surprised them earlier

MACREADY
Damn it ran out of gas

He pulls off the heavy hydrogen tanks and drapes them
over

the tractor As he talks his eyes move like a hawk
passing

from roof to doorways to rubble

Wind and ice bristle through the gaping holes stinging

MacReady with the cold He winces at his mittenless
blackened

fingers

MACREADY
Sweetheart its going to get mighty
cold in here soon You better make
your move I mean hell Im only
one person

He takes a swig from his bottle

MACREADY
I know youre bugged because we ruined
your trip right Spiffy little toy
you had there

A slight tremor perks his eyes and ears He looks up

through
the hole then around He lights a lighter and cups it
in
his hand near the stick of dynamite in his lap
MACREADY
But your real hang up is your looks
A stronger tremor The adrenalin pumps
MACREADY
(wants him bad)
Atta boy I know youre around
The floor shakes MacReady stands his head whirling
around
the room
MACREADY
Come on sucker
The tractor inches up off the ground MacReady falls
forward
and looks straight down through the chassis and into
the
vile and grinning face below A claw flashes up
splitting
the steering wheel but missing his face
He depresses the ignition bolting the tractor ten
feet
He jumps hanging onto the edge of the hole in the
ceiling
The Things face and arms burst through the metal
plating of
the tractor The reaching claws just miss him as he
pulls

himself through
up

like

fireball

disintegrating

and

He

off

CUT TO

shroud

patches

up

CUT TO

of

EXT ROOF
He lights his fuse drops in the stick turns and runs
Half of The Things grotesque and angular torso bolts

through the hole howling in fury An appendage springs
outward and winds around MacReadys jacket hissing

acid into the fabric

An immense explosion The hydrogen tanks send a white
fifty feet into the sky The Things body

almost immediately

The force of the blast sweeps MacReady off the roof He
the severed appendage crash to the hard ice in flames
rolls over and over trying to smother the fire and tear

the insidious limb

INT CAMP

A ruin One half of it burnt almost to the ground
MacReady wears a thick blanket which covers him like a
from his shoulders to the floor

He walks bent over and in much pain trying to blunt

of fire with an extinguisher It is futile He gives

INT PUB AREA
Mostly untouched by the fire but like most of the rest

the camp exposed to the outside The storm has settled
considerably

CLOSE ON MACREADY
lighting a cigar His hands are heavily wrapped He

pours
himself a drink
A puffy white hand missing two fingers enters the
frame
and whirls a startled MacReady around It is Childs
White and black blotches cover his frostbitten face
CHILDS
Did you kill it
He looks as weak as MacReady A beat
MACREADY
I think so
CHILDS
What do you mean you think so
Both men speak guardedly and stare at each other
suspiciously
MACREADY
Yeah I got it
(refers to Childs
condition)
Pretty mean frostbite
Childs steps back keeping his distance He indicates
his
puffy white hand
CHILDS
Itll turn black again soon enough
Then I guess Ill be losing the whole
thing
(refers to feet)
Think my toes are already gone
MacReady carrying the bottle and glass limps over and
sits
down behind a gaming table There is a chess set and
several

decks of cards The two men continue to eye each other

CHILDS
So youre the only one who made it

MacReady begins setting up a non-electronic chessboard
MACREADY
Not the only one

CHILDS
The fires got the temperature way
up all over camp wont last long
though

MACREADY

Neither will we

CHILDS
Maybe we should try and fix the
radio try and get some help
MACREADY

Maybe we shouldnt

CHILDS
Then well never make it

MacReady puffs on his cigar He reveals a small

blowtorch
from under the table and places it beside him on top

MACREADY
Maybe we shouldnt make it

CHILDS
(beat)
If youre worried about anything
lets take that blood test of yours

MACREADY
If weve got any surprises for each
other -- we shouldnt be in any
condition to do anything about it
(beat)
You play chess

They regard each other for a moment Childs painfully
sits
down across from MacReady

CHILDS
I guess Ill be learning

MacReady grins and hands the bottle to Childs Childs
smiles
back and takes a healthy swig
blackness

OUT

EXT COMPOUND - NIGHT
The fires smolder on Bright embers dance in the

pushed by the soughing wind

THE END

FADE
