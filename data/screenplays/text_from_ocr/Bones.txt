EXT BLACKSTONE AVE - 2000 - NIGHT

Dark night Most street lights shot out Just one or two of
the eerie vapor lights left on the block

A MIDDLE-AGED AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN carries his single bag of
groceries The man listens and watches carefully as he

negotiates the darkness between the few pools of light on the
street

We wont see his face until he reaches the next pool of
light but he walks with shoulders hunched in fear

Moving down the block all shops abandoned Broken windows
Rats The man almost trips over a vague shadow passed out
and crumpled in an abandoned doorway Its the crackhead we
saw mumbling himself into the nod-off zone Hes still
faintly singing a part of the bones song as the man passes
He stops in the light

And we see its SHOTGUN 20 years of fear and loathing etched
on his face He freezes listening for a second to the
crackheads wheezing mumbles - no - its something else hes
listening for -- and hearing

From behind him a low wheezy sound like some huge panting
dog He stops And it stops He walks on and it follows

As he hurries to the next pool of light and safety his ears
strain for the nearly silent padding and wheezing steadily
following

Suddenly he hears that panting closer and closer until its
nearly right behind him He starts running though he hasnt
yet seen anything Only heard the mongrel hot on his heels

FOLLOW WITH SHOTGUN

As he stumbles careens and wheezes through the streets and
alleys terrified Winded he eventually stops his hand
trembling into his shopping bag seeking a weapon

And we see the building hes paused beside Bones place
Pockmarked by age Like the face of some furious old man

Now he can almost feel the dogs breath on the back of his
neckShotgun spins whipping a bottle of milk out of the
bag and hurling it into the darkness behind him

The bottle smashes against the wall of Bones building For
a second silhouetted against the now whited wall the tall
too tall shape of the skinny black dog

Without waiting to see what he hit Shotgun takes off running
to reach his building across the street The sound of the
dogs nails skittering across the street right behind him --

-- and he just makes it --
INT SHOTGUNS BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

Inside safe panting for breath Then starts running up the
stairs

EXT SHOTGUNS BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

From outside his third floor window we see Shotgun run into
his apartment slam down his groceries on the counter grab
an old rifle from under his bed and hurry to his open window

INT SHOTGUNS APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

He scanaims out his window across the street to the now
desolate building where Bones once lived Finger on the
trigger eyes scanning the shadows for the dog Mumbling
quotations from the Bible about canines some of which are
handwritten and taped up on his walls and mirrors

SHOTGUN
Thou shalt not bring a dog into the
house of the Lord thy God for they are
an abomination Deuteronomy

Suddenly something moving on the empty street catches his
eye

HIS ANGLE ON

The Black Dog emerging from the shadows in the street Our
first good look at the beast Long clawed paws all teeth
and tongue and a curved bony rib cage like it hasnt eaten in
20 years

Its long black head seems almost to be throbbing moving
from within almost subliminally we see a weirder demonic
more skeletal dog face just beneath the black fur Or is it
just the buzzing light from the vapor lamps

SHOTGUN (CONTD)
(as he aims his rifle)
They return at evening snarling like
dogs and prowling the city Psalms 59
vs 6

The dog stands in the pool of light offering a perfect shot
Shotgun smiles aims and then fires making --

EXT BONES BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

-- a direct hit But the dog doesnt move Unfazed The
bullet must have missed Or else gone right through him
The long-faced dog just looks up at Shotgun like it was
laughing at the fool And has been for years

Shotgun reaches for the spilled groceries on the counter
Shoving aside bread and canned goods and other edible
necessitates and finds a half-dozen boxes of rifle rounds

He calmly reloads the rifle And the sound of another shot
echoes in the night over

EXT AROUND THE CORNER - CONTINUOUS

Two frat boys JASON and PALMER driving a too nice car ina
too bad part of town Palmer at the wheel while Jason makes
a call on the cellular

PALMER
Great Gun shots

JASON
Just a backfire

PALMER
Like youd know Face it Were lost

JASON
Take a left no I mean a right Okay
stop for a second

They stop in the middle of a block Jason on the phone

JASON (CONTD)
Were here Where the hell are you

STANK
(on phone)
Back here At the end of the block

He turns around and sees behind them TWO GUYS standing on
the far corner Ones on the phone

STANK (CONTD)
(on phone)
You got the cash

JASON
You got the shit

STANK
(on the phone)
Yeah but you got to come the rest of the
way on foot Leave your car and walk
over here

EXT STREET - SAME
They exit the car looking all around them with more than a
touch of paranoia

As they walk nervously down the block they join the two on
the corner Its STANK and WEAZE both 17

JASON
Let me see it

STANK
Let me see it

JASON
(hands him the money)
Where is it

STANK
I cant carry it in my pocket man And
I cant go get it for you cause you might
be a cop You gonna have to pick it up
yourself

Jason and Palmer arent sure about this By the sphincteral
look on his face Palmer would rather forget about it

STANK (CONTD)
Dont worry Its just round the corner
Halfway down that block you cant miss
it Top step of the front stairs
theres a loose stone Go on I aint
shitting you

JASON
Fuck it Alright

EXT BLACKSTONE AVE - CONTINUOUS

They walk around the corner and enter a bleak block with at
least half the lots burnt out

PALMER
Is it too late for me to officially
register my growing certainty that this
is an extremely bad idea

Farther down in the center of one side of the street stands
a particularly ominous abandoned building Bones building

Jason ignites a Zippo and they see one loose brick Jason
pulls it out and behind it sees a glint of baggy

JASON
Easy as pie And twice as tasty

He opens the bag Its filled with rock cocaine

ANGLE - ACROSS THE STREET
INT

On the third floor Shotgun sits in his straight-backed chair
in front of the open center window drinking coffee cradling
his rifle on his lap Sees the frat boys picking up their
shit Then he looks out at Bones tomb

Dark blank windows staring back at him the buildings front
door covered with broken vertical boards with jagged pieces
missing looking almost like a jack-o-lanterns grin

Shotgun then looks back down at the boys below From behind
them they hear their car alarm go off

PALMER
Someones screwing with the car

But from the other way come cops in a plain wrap car a hand
reaching out and putting the spinning blue light on the roof
No place to run No place to hide for the boys They reach

for the door of the shuttered building -- and it opens
SHOTGUN
Yo You two get the hell away from
there

But they ignore him and disappear into the darkness inside
the gaping maw of Bones building

Shotgun shakes his head sitting back down cradling his
rifle

SHOTGUN (CONTD)
Fools

BONES BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

Inside the boys huddle in the darkness behind the door
waiting for the cops to pass

The boys look around the decayed Gothic interior lit only by
the eerie glow of the sodium vapor lights outside

What we last saw as the ornate 70s luxury lobby in Bones
day is now a horror show

Walls torn and stained Mold grows in patches on the wall
and ceiling Huge cobwebs hang The furnitures all broken

A gnawing tearing sound makes Palmer spin a rat sticks its
head up through the rotted cushions of the couch

PALMER
Lets get the hell outta here

Jason shushes him as the room is filled with the flashing
blue light of the cop car trawling slowly down the street
From inside they hear the sounds of a car door slamming and
cop shoes walking

JASON
Oh fuck cmon

He gropes his way in the darkness to a staircase Palmer is
right behind him as they slip upstairs deeper into the
gaping darkness of the abandoned building

While below them the door opens and cop lights and cop voices
penetrate the gloom

OLDER COP
not going in there Waste o time

YOUNGER COP
I saw em go in

And from the boys high vantage point up the stairs we see
the first cop walk in with flashlight drawn

WHILE INSIDE THE COP CAR - CLOSE ANGLE

All we see are two meaty hands unwrapping a wax-paper covered
pork chop sandwich The cop face in shadow brings the drip
ping sandwich up over his huge belly towards his face

INSIDE BONES BUILDING

The frat boys hold their breath while rats run across their
feet Jason slamming his hand over Palmers mouth to keep
him from screaming

DOWN BELOW

The young plainsclothes cop steps deeper into the room and
shines his flashlight at the stairwell

UPSTAIRS

Jason pulls the reluctant Palmer further up the stairs to
the third floor as below them they hear the cop coming up

Jason pulls Palmer through the nearest door and into
INT JIMMY BONES OLD PAD - CONTINUOUS

The rotted remains of what was once Jimmy Bones master
bedroom The room he was betrayed and slaughtered in

DOWNSTAIRS

The cop begins to head up the stairs Visible behind him
down through the open front door is the plain wrap car The
older cop inside mouth fulla sammich loudly says
FAT OLDER COP
Forget it No way theyre in there
Trust me Ive been working down here
twenty years No one goes in there

FROM THE FAT OLDER COPS POV

We watch as the younger cop returns to the car giving up
And when he climbs in we reverse and reveal who the older
cop is LUPOVICH the cop who helped kill Bones

But hes decayed and expanded into a Hank Quinlan-like
mountain of corrupt cop flesh Too many pork chop
sandwiches

LUPOVICH
Lets get the hell outta here

INT JIMMYS OLD PAD - SAME

From upstairs the boys see the blue light of the cop car
recede as the car pulls away down below

Palmer reaches for the door He wants out But in the
darkness he cant find the door

PALMER
Gimme some light

Behind Jason we see a shape a shadow a tall silhouette a
man-shaped deeper darkness forming within the darkness

Jason lights his lighter And in the flickering we see
behind him that this room now contains a portion of hell

Its not just the chipped paint and peeled rotted wall paper
or the cracks and gaps in the broken old ceiling mirror

All surfaces seem to be a swirling shifting pattern in which
we can dimly and subliminally make out faces as if people
were trapped on the surface of things Exactly like the
glimpse we had beneath the world when Jimmy died

The floor the walls the furniture everything in it -- made
out of the wracked and twisted devouring and devoured forms
of dead souls Their faces hollow pleading eyes and howling
mouths visible like flowing grain in wood

And in the center of it all stands the dark silhouette of
Bones impossibly tall and thin stretching malevolently out
across the room like a living shadow

But the boys dont see this as theyre finding the door We
see Bones shadow arching towards them while they fumble

Palmer finally opens the door to the sound of a deep rumbling
growl from the darkness on the other side And in the open
door stands the black dog
They boys jump back But breathes easy

PALMER (CONTD)
Just a dog

And the black dog leaps up at them -- teeth flying right for
the boys throats And in the flickering ghastly light we
see its demon face breaking through

The dog sinks his long teeth into Jasons arm He flails and
drops his lighter still lit on the floor

As soon as he does the dog releases Jason and disappears as
fast as it appeared back into the darkness

The two kids panic Jason shaking and bleeding looking
around waiting for the dog or something else to attack
seeing back through the doorway into the room from hell

Behind them we see that tall man-shaped shadow The Bones
shadow is oblivious to the two frantic boys intent only on
the small flickering flame of the lighter still burning where
it fell against the lower wood paneling of the wall

A thin trail of black smoke as the flame barely begins to
catch on the chipped lead-filled flammable paint

THE BOYS RUN

And stumble down the hall away from the horror while back in
the room the Bones-shadow watches as the lighter flickers and
dies out Other than a slightly blackened spot the wall is
unburned

The black shadow shudders in rage arches back and hooooowls
in frustration its mouth abnormally large The shadowy head
snaps in the direction of the boys -- ready to vent its
wrath and for a subliminal second we see in the head the
hellish face of Jimmy Bones

The boys round the second floor landing and fly down the last
flight of stairs

Jasons foot breaks through a rotted floorboard and for a
second it appears as though rotten hands are just below the
stairs grabbing at his foot and leg

He yelps in terror pulling his foot back as they continue
towards the front door the Bones-things woofer-busting howl
roaring down from the third floor

THE SHEER INFINITE ADRENALINE RUSH
Of pure horror and the desperation to survive drags the boys

off the stairs as they tear across the floor and hurl
themselves out the front door into the night air Jason
falling and lying on the stoop
EXT BONES BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

Across the street Shotgun sees the boys in the doorway
Then as a nearly dead vapor light suddenly flickers and
comes to life the shadows created on Bones building make it
look almost like a demonic face

Gulping for air laughing hysterically at their survival the
frat boys pause Jason sits back on his butt checking his
wound The doorway behind them just a black hole in space

PALMER
(bumping fists together)
Damn bro That was close

THEN SUDDENLY

Something - it happens so fast were not sure just what grabs
sucks-pulls Palmer back into the black doorway hole

Jason still prone tries to crawl away but whatever got his
friend now sucks him in too His fingernails scraping along
the stoop in frenzied desperation

WITH SHOTGUN

When he hears the boys pitiful screams and whimpers from
across the street he leaps to his feet and tries to see into
the dark of the doorway across the street But he can only
hear what is happening to the unlucky frat fellas

Moans and the sound of flesh torn and swallowed and their
last dying screams

UP AND DOWN THE BLOCK

The screaming reverberates Faces appear in some windows
While in others shades are drawn and the lights go out

BACK WITH SHOTGUN
Mumbling to himself

SHOTGUN
For outside are dogs and sorcerers
Revelation 22 vs 15

Tears welling in his eyes that he angrily flicks away
LOOKING AT THE BUILDING

It still has the shadowy lookshape of Jimmy Bones now
shifting again as the vapor light on the street sputters out
again plunging the street into near darkness The body of
Palmer no longer visible below
When he looks back the building seems just an old building
again Then theres movement in an upper window catching
his eye Shotgun sees the tall shadowy silhouette

The figure is elongated cant tell if it is a man or the
distorted shadow of a man It beckons to Shotgun

SHOTGUN

Just tightens his grip on his rifle and speaks as if the
shadowy thing across the street could hear him

SHOTGUN (CONTD)
You still mad Still want me Come on
and get me

THE SHADOW

Shakes its head As if it can hear him And again mutely
beckons to him

ON SHOTGUN

SHOTGUN (CONTD)
Oh right You cant Youre trapped
there Well aint that too bad Aint
that just too damn bad

Behind the fur-covered steering wheel SHOTGUN a broke-nosed
bodyguard for the man in the back seat

toys with a long silver razor polished and oiled to
perfection so that the long glinting blade can swing back and
forth or lock into position

Bones steps out from the car on to his street like a
benevolent feudal lord or a popular Mafia Don

QUICK CUTS OF JIMMY

-- greeting and soul shaking every man woman and child on
the block they display a mixture of fearlove and respect

-- coolly taking down numbers in a notebook soothing to the
losers encouraging to the wary tough with the welchers

-- and handing out a rare win to an astonished old man
standing in his pajamas in the doorway of an old tenement

We see Pearl standing at the sink scrubbing the blood

on her washing her hands washing and washing them
CREDITS ROLL OVER

Her hands washing becomes time passing Years decades the
building and the surroundings decay And still the dark
skinny dog prowls the shadows Just one more reason we no
longer see anyone walk the street at night

The 90s end --

And Bones building stands worn and naked with burnt-out lots
on either side And the street feels like a ghost town

In the evil colored light of the gaseous street lights
Bones own shadow stretches and distorts across all three
stories His shadow face filling a window As in and around
the building and out in the ruins on either side the black
dog still walks

AND FINALLY RETURN TO WEATHERED HANDS STILL WASHING
THEMSELVES IN HOT WATER --

To the PRESENT

years older washing her hands And then drying them

Tia checks out the second floor while Bill and Maurice
continue up the stairs to the third floor Bones old crib

WITH BILL AND MAURICE

Behind them barely subliminal glimpse - a manshaped darker
shadow within a shadow Bill feels a cold wind from nowhere
And hears a whispery sound seemingly carried in the breeze

HOLLOW ECHOES
It aint eh money Its the big fat

MAURICE
I didnt say nothing

HOLLOW ECHOES

BELOW ON THE SECOND FLOOR

Tias checking out a bedroom Hears a light tinkling in a
closet She opens it empty except a row of rusty metal
hangers holding the moldy remains of Bones old suits

DOWNSTAIRS IN THE BASEMENT - PATRICK

Is there a flashlight poking around Trying to find the
metal knob to turn on the gas Eerie as hell down there

Out of the corner of our eyes we see a shadow moving
looming A scurrying sound and Patrick turns his flashlight
in the other direction we glimpse a bloated rat

Behind him the shadow we glimpsed grows elongates Patrick
notes another door This one padlocked Sensing someone or
something behind him Patrick turns with the flashlight

Nothing there But the Bones-shadow is behind him again
Again he feels something and again he turns the flashlight
around nothing

Except the Bones-shadow is againbehind him

Shaking it off Patrick heads for the old heater pulling out
matches to light the pilot as Bones-shadow stays behind him

BONES POV
Bones watches as Patrick reaches around the gas heater When

Patrick strikes a match head the Bones-shadow moves even
closer to him as Patrick reaches in and lights the pilot
When Patrick steps back Bones-shadow grows and stretches
spreading like an ink stain reaching across to where the
pilot flame flickers

In profile the shadow-mouth blowsbut no breath comes out
The flame doesnt even flicker

Bones tilts his head back and lets loose an eerie bellow of
frustration in a subliminal flash we see a howling mouth
bigger than any human mouth howling within the shadow-face

The sound echoes all through the basement rooms as Patrick
walks back upstairs He slaps a nearby plumbing pipe

PATRICK
Go on old pipes groan all you like
Just please dont burst That I cant
afford

FOLLOW WITH BONES POV

As disappointed in whatever he hoped blowing out the furnace
pilot would do he steps into the rusted remains of the old
elevator and the POV begins to levitate

INT ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

Bones POV rises straight up as if still in a working
elevator It rises and we follow up from the basement to the
empty first floor past the second floor to

THE THIRD FLOOR

Where were still inside floating in the elevator cage
Then the POV moves through the metal bars and floats towards
Bill whos approaching the door of the room where Jimmy
died

As Bill reaches to open it Bones POV floats closer - and
closer - right up on Bills back now Bill feeling the hairs
on his neck suddenly rising Then he hears

HOLLOW ECHOES
Go on It wont kill you

Bill turns around to check with Maurice

BILL
You had to hear tha

But Maurice is gone And he doesnt see the shadow there
behind him Bill leans in to the door listening

HOLLOW ECHOES
I aint gonna be the only one with this
niggers blood on my hands
BILL
What the f--

A hand jolts him from behind He spins -- its just Maurice
MAURICE
S up
BILL

Nothing Contact paranoia Must be
buggin from hanging with you

They turn to walk back down Maurice stops to re-light his
joint when the Bones-shadow reaches out to grab his wrist

But its no good The shadow hand passes right through
Maurice pauses for an instant as if he felt something

Maurice lights his roach and the match burns closer and
closer to his fingertips Then singes them and he drops the
match Maurice then heads downstairs after Bill

e shadow remains behind staring at the still burning match
n the wooden floor He bends down staring intently as if
illing it to burn his hands urging it on the flame

uddenly rising But then the match sputters harmlessly out
e shadow turns back towards the boys downstairs

HuozOH

WHILE ON THE SECOND FLOOR

Tia explores the rest of the floor Hears a sound like a
whimpering from behind another door

She slowly eases open the door then jumps back -- Inside the
dog It growls low and mean the black fur on the back of
its neck rising Its eyes burning too red and bright

Tia freezes

The dog growls deeply at her And as he does we see the
Bones shadow rising behind her It seems to lean in and over
her and the dog stops growling

Tia cautiously holds her hand outstretched with the burger
for the dog to smell

Bones shadow from lingers behind her perhaps simply
enjoying the first sight in hellish eons of a beautiful girl

TIA
Howd you get locked in here And for

how long Poor baby

The dog leaps up - but not to rip her throat out Instead it
snatches the burger and wolfs it down in one gulp

TIA (CONTD)
Poor boy You must be starving

into my pocket so I could buy toys and

(now to Mauriceat camera)
Bones was awrright He was solid And
then one day he just wasnt around no
more Dont pay to ask too many
questions ‘round here

INT THE BUILDING - THAT NIGHT
Upstairs inside what was once Bones bedroom Beneath the
cracked ceiling mirror Bill lies on the airmattress Hes
listening with headphones to a minidisk player

Eyes closed head nodding to the beat Around him we see
something strange The room shifts

Its the same room But changed It looks like it did when
the frat boys were trapped in here Or in the instant after
Jimmys death all surfaces seem to be a swirling shifting
pattern in which we can dimly make out faces as if people
were trapped on the surface of things

Then the faces and bodies begin to step out of their surfaces
and into the room

So as Bill eyes still closed rocks to the hypnotic beats in
his headphones we see the room around him begin to fill with
figures

-- all twisted dead human forms emerging out of the surfaces
of floor and walls We hear a low murmur of ghost voices
different languages

And as the track ends the sound cuts through Bills
headphones and his eyes snap open

But the room is empty And completely normal Bill pulls
off his head phones Ears strain to listen

BILL
Tia Patrick That you

The sounds return fainter and form above Bill looks up
and for a fraction of a second in the mirror Bill sees the
crowded eerie hell of the other version of the room

Bill jolts out of bed and to the door whips it open and
someone dark looms right there But its just Patrick

BILL (CONTD)
Shit

PATRICK
Spooked

Bill looks back into the room normal now Glances up at the
mirror just a cracked reflection of the empty room

BILL
No Well yeah Maybe just a little

PATRICK
Yeah there is a strange vibe here

He stops Both brothers look at each other waiting for the
other to admit hes seen or felt somethings here
BILL
Wheres the others

PATRICK
Maurice left Tias taking a bath

INT BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

The bathroom is entirely wood lined like some 70s hot tub
paradise The room dominated by a large two person tub

Tia lights four small scented candles on the counter The
wind through the open window blows the curtains She shuts
the window and then steps gingerly into the steaming bathtub

She lies down in the bath with her back to the door The
four candles throwing varying shadows of her

Then one of the shadows becomesthe shadow of Bones All
its attention is focused on one lit candle The one closest
to the curtain

Slowly the Bones shadows fingers start to caress the
curtain to make it move ever so slowly closer and closer to
the candle The drapery reaches out straining straining
towards the candle flame

Tia soaks with her eyes closed enjoying the moist heat

Bones shadow fingers more and more urgently drawing the
flame towards the curtain the curtain towards the flame
And soon the corner of the drape just reaches the little
flickering flame And in an instant the drape is on fire

INT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Patrick and Bill still talking in front of the bedroom down
the hall from the bathroom

PATRICK

Their conversation interrupted by screams from down the
hall from the bathroom

walls Tia leaps out of the tub screaming trying to throw

Pearl reaches into an old bureau drawer and pulls out an old
photo Jimmy Bones with his arm around her She sits down at
her table with a drink and just looks at the picture of
herself and her lover when the world was innocent and young
She downs her glass and wipes her tears away

In the upper window of the Bones Building we see his
silhouette staring down the block towards Pearl

INT JEREMIAHS KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Bones the dog slinks into the kitchen Sniffing the air
Still hungry Always hungry

His big black paw actually opens the refrigerator With his
long nose he digs into the meat drawer Inside he finds

plastic wrapped raw hamburger meat

He pulls it out and drops it on the floor Tears it open and
gorges himself on the raw meat

INT SUB-BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
And as he does the ground seems almost to breathe or glow
Bones plunges his long shadow-hands right into the earth as
if he could touch what was beneath and raise it up

He remains like that shadow hands buried in the dirt head
tilting back and howling

The house is dark and quiet All are asleep The dog moves
silently through the house sniffing at doors

INT MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

The dog silently noses the door open and stealthily enters
and pads softly over to Jeremiahs side of the bed

Where it stares intently at the sleeping Jeremiah who begins
to toss and turn He settles again on his back His head
tilted back his soft vulnerable throat exposed

The dog steps closer to the bed We can almost feel the
dogs hot fetid breath inches away from his throat

The dog stares at Jeremiah And for just a second the long
doggy face wavers and changes in shifting shades of black a
ragged red demonic face ripples beneath the black fur -- and
looks for an instant as if it were about to lunge and rip out
Jeremiahs throat

But at the last second it freezes Head cocks and ear lifts
as if hearing something in the wind Its masters voice
perhaps And then the dog reverts to normal and pads out of
the room as silently as it entered

EXT BONES BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

Cinnabar stops outside the building Shes about to knock
when she instinctively freezes We can almost see the hairs
standing up on her neck one by one

She looks around -- what is it A sound like a moan Is it
her name Or just the wind

Suddenly with a creak the door swings open

She takes a hesitant step into the building Suddenly she
jumps as a door to her left flies open

Its just Patrick She laughs in relief

CINNABAR
Just thought Id see if you needed any
help

Patrick too surprised and tongue-tied to respond so Tia
helps him out

TIA
Good We do need help First you can
help us eat lunch

Cinnabar follows Patrick into the room with a last tense
look over her shoulder -- still the feeling somethings
there

INT BONES BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

Tias feeding the insatiable dog Handing quarter-pounders
to it the thing scarfing em as fast as she can unwrap them
Then for a second it stops And looks up And just stares
at something it knows is there -- but we humans cant see

Watcha looking at poochie

Cinnabar follows the dogs glance She sees nothingor is
there something for a second there in the corner

REVERSE - BONES-VISION POV

Is staring back at her and at the dog Cinnabar pulls her
sweater around her shoulders

CINNABAR
I hate it when dogs do that Like
theyre looking right out of the world

The dog continues scarfing down burgers having him his way
Cinnabar looks warily at the beast Who stares right back at

her while wolfing down the burgers

Steps through the rusted metal into the old elevator shaft
and we follow it as it floats down

over the seeing dirt the dirt moving ever so subtly and for

INT BONES BUILDING - LATER THAT DAY

In Bones old room Patrick rolls over the faded stained old
shag carpet with a huge carpet cleaner

ANGLE ON

The transparent tubes of the cleaner fill with disgusting red
fluid and carpet fibers

TIME CUT TO

Patrick stands back and surveys his work The carpet looks
perfect Old a little faded but clean No stains

With a smile of satisfaction he rolls the cleaner out of the
room and closes the door behind him We remain in the room

ANGLE ON

The now clean carpet Suddenly we see glutinous red liquid
seeping back up through the shag until the stain is right
where it was Wet and fresh Then we see it spread and
move in the shape of a body and the path by which it was
dragged out of the room

The door opens again and Patrick steps in to show off the
freshly painted room clean rug to Cinnabar and the others
Hes brought up short by the sight of the stain

PATRICK
Must be something seeping through From
the floor

They roll the carpet back thinking there must be something
on the floor The floor beneath the carpet is wet too but
cant tell if its from the rug or vice-versa
He puts his hand down on the wood A low rhythmic rumbling

PATRICK (CONTD)
Do you feel that

The others place their hands on the floor

TIA
Yeah Its Throbbing

BILL
Like a heartbeat

MAURICE
Like a heartbeatLike a love beat
Listen to the Di Franco twins there
Just the plumbing or something fool

PATRICK
Maybe theres a pipe underneath the
floor It leaked and stained

They just look at him

PATRICK (CONTD)
You got a better explanation

INT BASEMENT - LATER

Patrick and the others in the basement listening to some very
strange sounds groans thumps throbs

MAURICE
Sounds like we got the Invisible Scratch
Piklz hiding in our pipes

Patrick traces the piping with the wrench he comes to a
triple corner where three small pipes all come together

PATRICK
I think these bring the water down from
the bathroom Into this

A larger pipe that goes down the wall and disappears beneath
the floor The thumping sounds emanate from here He puts
his finger along the seam of the joint He pulls it away
red

PATRICK (CONTD)
Check it out The same shit that was in
the carpet Told you it was from the
plumbing

He lifts the wrench to tighten the seal The metal groans
Then snaps Sending a thick spray of foul smelling red
sludge shooting out of the seam right into Patricks face
PATRICK (CONTD)
Damn I knew these pipes were wacked

He turns the wrench the other way re-tightening The sound
seems to move now through the piping Then the red sludge
sprays out of the next three joints smearing the others

The pounding throbbing sounds begin to bounce around the
room as if something were actually moving through the pipes
until it returns to the central large pipe and moves down
disappearing beneath their feet

Then a rasping bark calls their attention Bones the dog
sits by the padlocked door panting Grinning

Patrick smashes the old lock with the large wrench and opens
the door to reveal another set of stairs leading down into a
deeper storm cellar where the sound disappeared

INT STORM CELLAR STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

As they go the temperature drops A cold damp sheen
appears on their skin Then comes a thick glutinous buzzing
sound

TIA
What is that

Flies The stairway walls are thick with furry black flies

MAURICE
(stopping)
Ugh Muchos moscos man This is too
much
BILL

Just some flies

MAURICE
Some flies I think this qualifies as
way more than some

CINNABAR
What a smell

MAURICE
Hey what you expect Where theres
smoke theres fire And where theres
flies theres shit

The stairs end in a dark damp dirt cellar and the remnants
of the terminus of the old elevator shaft

MAURICE (CONTD)
Oh yeah I guess this would be that space
that was so perfect for a recording
studio

BILL
Maurice man shut the fuck up

PATRICK
Yeah well Maurice is right Its gonna
take more work than I thought But we
can still do it Well lay a real floor
in here Put damping on the walls
Totally controlled sound Be perfect
No one could hear shit up on the street

Behind them the dog is digging in the dirt Furiously

MAURICE

Yeah perfect Really excellent We can
make our first record where no one can
hear us scream Be afraid

Theyre not paying any attention to the dogs incessant
digging Only Cinnabar is Shes staring at it

CINNABAR
Oh god

And she sees in the deepening muddy hole at the dogs paws
at first glimpses and then the full view a rotted human
corpse Really just a skeleton With something sticking out
of its chest Cinnabar shrieks while the guys try very hard
to act real cool

BILL
Hello Whore you

Maurice bends and pulls out the now blood rusted razor

MAURICE
Boys and girls Moms and Dads Children
of all ages Id like you to meet
Jimmy Bones

BILL
What the hell you talking about

MAURICE

(singing)
This is the story of Jimmy BonesBlack
as night and hard as stonesGold plated
deuce like the King of SiamGot his
switchblade loose and a diamond on his
hand Theres the switchblade and
theres the diamond Dont know where
the deuce is parked

He points to one of the bony hands The left one On the
third finger is Jimmys big diamond ring
BILL
You think thats really him

MAURICE
Damn Its sofresh

And hes right Oddly for an old skeleton there are strands
and bands of wet raw flesh Maurice lifts the hand wearing
the ring He starts top pull it loose from the finger

TIA
Boy put that thing down You cant take
that Might be evidence

PATRICK
Evidence of what

TIA
Somehow I dont think he stabbed himself
in the chest then buried himself too

Cinnabar sees something Bright color beneath the body
Bends down to a piece of cloth poking out from beneath the
bones

The dog growls viciously as she reaches down to the scrap of
color poking up Tia restrains the hound the best she can

PATRICK
Get your damn dog girl

The cloth is the corner of a dressthe dog suddenly lunges
for Cinnabars hands ripping at them She pulls back

PATRICK (CONTD)
Shit Damn dog We gonna have to do
something about you

TIA
What we have to do is call the police

MAURICE
Right Call the police Well have no
problem getting our permits then

TIA
We cant just leave it here

PATRICK
Yeah we can Least till after this
weekend He aint going nowhere Well
deal with it then

BILL
Whatever lets just get the hellout of
here
They all start to leave except Maurice and Cinnabar Hes
loitering by the body eyeing the ring Shes staring into
the dark corner of the sub-basement

HER POV IN THE DIM LIGHT

She sees something wavering a shadow-mirage Bones

PATRICK (0S)
Cinn

CINNABAR
What Oh yeah Coming

She follows the others upstairs Bones watches her form as
she climbs the steps and --

-- for a second from BONES POV we see her mother when she
was young

Bones looks now at Maurice Who checks to see if the others
are gone Then Maurice hurriedly bends down and while
holding his face back away from the stench attempts to pull
Bones ring off his finger But its stuck

He tugs again harder and rips the corpses finger off

MAURICE
Oh fuck

Oh fuck is right Bones shadow rears as it sees this
desecration Maurice slips the ring off the finger stump

MAURICE (CONTD)
(to the corpse)
Sorry but you wont be needing this

He places the finger back by the hand And pockets the ring

MAURICE (CONTD)
Or this

INT BUILDING KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT

Tia fills a bowl with dry dog food But Bones the dog turns
his head away and just whimpers

TIA
Picky mutt

She pulls out a package of raw hamburger dumps it into the
bowl then leaves Behind her the dog tucks into his chow

INT THE STORM CELLAR GRAVE - CONTINUOUS

The lock broken the door stands ajar And as the dog gorges
upstairs something very strange is happening down here

Flesh is growing on the bones Bit by bit red wet strips
of muscle and flesh appear and spread over the corpse

The shadow looks down at his semi-reconstituted corpse It
almost looks like him minus the skin But it still has a
long ways to go Still mere strips of muscle and flesh on
the skeleton

EXT PEARLS STOREFRONT - NIGHT

Her usual small crowd arrives for her seance all hoping this
will be the night they reach their loved ones spirits From
outside through the window we see Pearl greet and seat each
of them around the table She starts lighting candles

INT BONES PAD - NIGHT

Patrick and Cinnabar sipping a little Remy in his room
Alone at last Awkward Intimate He refills her glass

CINNABAR
She doesnt want me here With you In
this house

PATRICK
Believe me my old mand rupture his
spleen if he knew we was down here All
he talks about is the medal he deserves
for building us a life as far from this
hood as possible

CINNABAR
He probably thinks hes saving you from
something Im sure thats what my
mother thinks

PATRICK
Im sure I can make your mother like me
But then do I gotta worry bout your
father

Suddenly their banter is dead Her face looks stung like
hed slapped her

CINNABAR
I dont know anything about my father I
never met him Momma wont talk about
him either

He puts his arms around her and she melts into him
INT PEARLS STOREFRONT - NIGHT

Pearl and the others seated in the dim room around a circular
table They are holding hands Only candle light

PEARL
We should begin with a hymn

INT BONES BUILDING - NIGHT - UPSTAIRS

In Bones old room the temperature between Cinn and Patrick
goes from PG to R

The two kiss passionately deeply -- Cinnabar loses herself
for a long beat -- then as if swimming up from the bottom of
a deep pool she pulls herself back

CINNABAR
I cant Not yet

PATRICK
Its alright If you want to go home

CINNABAR
No I want to stay with you guys But I
cant I mean Im not ready

PATRICK
Dont worry about it Ill stay with the
boys

EXT PEARLS STOREFRONT - NIGHT

From outside through the open window we can hear the
strains of singing coming from her window

INT PEARLS PARLOR - CONTINUOUS

We float around the members of Pearls circle See objects
on the table flickering in the candlelight

PEARL
The spirit world is all around us right
this minute And the departed are
pressing in around us

Still singing they all glance about them in darkness as if
they can make out the spirits around them

Over the low bass of their hymn-singing her voice cuts in
Uncoiling and rising like smoke in the air its a beautiful
voice and it does seem to open a window in the air

INT BONES ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Cinnabar gets into bed and turns off the light Pitch dark
in there cant see a thing
As shes drifting off to dreamland she hears what sounds
like the door quietly opening and someone slipping into the
darkness of the room we just stay on her face

Its cold in the place And spooky So she doesnt mind
when she feels what she assumes is Patrick slip in bed beside
her Though we see only a shape sliding under the covers

CINNABAR
(half-asleep)
Its okay just dont get funny on me
Its warmer this way

INT PEARLS PARLOR - CONTINUOUS

Suddenly the curtains fly open And Pearls voice suddenly
stops and the flame on the candle shoots up scorching the
ceiling before returning to normal

PEARL
Someones with us Whos joined the
circle

OLD MAN

Lordywhats that smell

OLD WOMAN
Look The flowers

The flowers whither They retch from some smell
PEARL
Knock once for yes And twice for no
Is there someone who wishes to send a
message

Table rocks once

PEARL (CONTD)
A message for one of us in the circle

Table rocks once

PEARL (CONTD)
Is it for miss Lillian

Table rocks twice -- no

PEARL (CONTD)
Is it a message for Mr Abernathy

Table rocks twice -- No again She goes around the room
inquiring for each of them Each time the table says No
Until there is only her left An eerie pause

PEARL (CONTD)
Is the message for me

The table starts bucking wildly And suddenly Pearls neck
SNAPS back like its been caught in a whip

Her mouth opens and a low moan escapes But sounds nothing
like her voice A deep wind through an organ tube with
swarming bees and squealing hogs mixed in

Everyone around the table just stares at her in alarm

As her eyes widen Go super close on her eyes and we see a
reflection in her pupil not of the room she is in but the
Jimmys building twenty years ago

INT BONES BUILDING - PASTPRESENT

INTERCUT with her face back in the seance staring wide
mouthed in her trance

The sound of her heart pounds like the deepest dub track

Total dislocation for her as she sees Jimmys old room as it
was -- but also sees it as it is now and with her daughter
Cinnabar lying underneath the covers of the big round bed

And lying close beside her another figure beneath the
covers

Whoever is there snuggles closer to Cinnabar She responds
as he presses against her then wakes up

CINNABAR
(laughing low)
Cut it out

But he doesnt The movement beside her is undulant
Strong erotic she almost gives into it And still laughs
as she says

CINNABAR (CONTD)
No no Patrick Stop

The figure in the bed presses urgently against her ina
rocking movement which catches her up in it She cant help
it she begins to respond to the urging behind her

Pearls eyes widen as the whole room shifts and becomes one

fetid Necropoliptic texture The bed retains its shape but

liquefies seems to become one with the floor and the walls
all made of a kind of thick bloody-mud in which the trapped
faces and distorted limbs of the dead twist and moan

Meanwhile on that strange bed the figure behind Cinnabar
seems to wrap soft limbs around her locking her in embrace

CINNABAR (CONTD)
Cut it out

But it doesnt cut out It builds Strong Erotic
Insistent She almost gives in to it

CINNABAR (CONTD)
No no Patrick Stop

But the movement is more insistent And rougher She starts
to protest louder when she feels a hand or something steal

across her mouth to muffle her objections

Pearl tires to reach across her vision to grab her daughter
and help her but she cant

INT PEARLS PARLOR - CONTINUOUS

Back at the seance Pearls back is arched like a bass fiddle
string bowed and then drops Released Back in her chair

The instant shes returned to herself shes out of her chair
and out the door

INT BONES PAD - CONTINUOUS

Cinnabar struggles with something in the bed the covers
pulled tight against her face she cant scream She twists
and wrenches herself about finally striking behind her with
a flailing fist twists her face free and screams

CINNABAR
Patrick Stop

Across the room the door suddenly opens -- its Patrick

PATRICK
Whats wrong

ANGLE - AT PATRICKS FEET
The black silhouette of the DOG slips out the door

PATRICK (CONTD)
Are you alright

Cinnabar looks wildly around the room -- shes alone in the
big bed No one attacking her And she sees Patrick in the
doorway But then who - or what - was in the bed

Suddenly her mother yells from below

PEARL (0S)
Cinnabar

Cinnabar lurches out of the bed over to the window Down
below her mothers going nuts at the entrance pounding on
the door and practically running over Bill whos opening the
door

PEARL (CONTD)
Outta my way boy Cinnabar Im
coming

BILL
Why dont you hang on and Ill see if
shes here

PEARL
I know damn well shes there

INT BONES BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

Cinnabar races down the stairs with Patrick bewildered at
her heels

Cinnabar runs out the door and straight into her mothers
arms burying her face in the protective bosom of her mom

Pearl wraps her frightened daughter in her arms and turns her
to home Pearl looks up at the boys standing stunned in the
doorway

PEARL
You might as well just dig down six feet
of muddy earth and sleep in your own
grave than stay another night in that
house

She turns back towards her place still holding the sobbing
Cinnabar Bill and Patrick stand stunned in the doorway

BILL
You sure got a way with women bro What
happened up there

PATRICK
Damned if I know

EXT BLACKSTONE - DAY

Up on a ladder the boys put on the finishing touches and
then HANG a new NEON SIGN over the door Looks pretty cool

TIA
Yes Were in business

INT JEREMIAHS CAR - LATE AFTERNOON

Heading south on Lake Shore Drive a tensely smiling Patrick
in the front seat with Jeremiah

JEREMIAH
Where are we going You know I hate
surprises
PATRICK
A little business move I made On my
own I think youre gonna approve

EXT CAR - CONTINUOUS

Heading off the main road into the ghetto But as they head
further and further south Jeremiahs getting uneasy

JEREMIAH
What are we doing down here

PATRICK
Like you always said Pop look for the
undervalued

Now they are on the old street As they drive down the
street Jeremiahs getting more and more agitated

EXT BLACKSTONE - CONTINUOUS

They park and get out He looks up and down the street
oddly frightened

PATRICK
I bet you didnt even know your bank
owned the place I did it through a
broker so you wouldnt know it was me
I couldnt wait to see your face when I
fixed it up

Its the building Freshly painted with the neon sign But
Jeremiahs face shows nothing like what Patrick expected
Nothing but a horrified angry disgust

JEREMIAH
Is this some kind of sick joke

Jeremiahs so angry he almost smacks Patrick

JEREMIAH (CONTD)
Listen to me boy I didnt work all my
life to get out of this neighborhood for
you to move right back in

PATRICK
I thought youd be psyched Just trying
to do what you did Take nothing and
make something out of it

JEREMIAH
No onell ever come here Shut it down
Dont worry the bankll buy it back
Ill take care of it

PATRICK
Youll take care of it Not this time
No way I bought it fair and square
And we open tonight

JEREMIAH
Bullshit Bullshit Youre selling it
back Thats an order

Jeremiah is furious out of all proportions Some of the
others on the block have stuck their noses out to see what
the fuss is Then Jeremiah comes eye to eye with Pearl
standing across the street watching worried out of her
mind

Then he looks up and sees Shotgun in the window
Feeling
trapped humiliated He wants out of this street Out of
those glances

JEREMIAH (CONTD)
You all are coming back to the house
now

Nobody moves Jeremiah walks back to his car and pulls away
Patrick frozen turned to stone by rage and hurt and shame

Another car pulls up Several young people inside They
look around a little dubiously

CLUBBER
Man I think were lost You guys know
where Illibent is

They all look at each other Silent Until Maurice answers
by flipping a switch igniting the neon sign for the first
time

Illibent shines in brilliant blue gas letters

DOWN THE BLOCK - LATER

The deuce and a quarter stops in front of a storefront A
young Nefertiti in platforms and dashiki picks fresh fruit
and vegetables from the small grocery PEARL VAUGHN

BONES
Pull over Ill walk the rest

Pearls picking ripe fruit Jimmy steps in catches her
hands and the melon in them in his hands

BONES (CONTD)
Naw all wrong First start at the
belly button

He strokes his thumb over the end of the cantaloupe leaning
in to her

BONES (CONTD)

Gotta be an in-ey and gotta be smooth
If its ragged it was picked too soon
Wont ever be ripe Second its got to
have just a little give here

(his hands on her hips)
At the edges And last but not very far
from least

(now only a breath apart)
You gotta get your nose in it and give it
a gooooood looooong sniff

PEARL
I dont know whether to chill you and
serve with cottage cheese or rip you
open and eat you right here

She chooses the latter they kiss
EXT STREET - TIME CUT

Jimmys walking Pearl home an apartment above the storefront
of her mothers fortune telling business

BONES
Listen Baby I gotta TCB this evening
So come over bout eight We should be
finished by then

EXT BONES BUILDING - LATER

Jimmy arrives home to be greeted on the steps of his building
by soul shakes and black hand fives from the corner boys
hanging out front

INT BONES BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

Follow Bones into the lobby with people waiting to see him
for favors etc Rooms on either side doors open allowing
us to glimpse his crew taking orders over the phones

An old fashioned metal cage elevator with an equally old
fashioned operator waits to take Mr Jimmy up to his pad We
ride up with him the king in his castle

INT BONES PAD - CONTINUOUS

The elevator lets him out in his main room A 70s love
pit Mirrored ceiling circular bed Thick shag carpeting

Jimmy nods at Shotgun who lowers the needle into classic
vinyl groove of some prime Funkadelic (Nappy Dug-out)
Jimmy splashes cologne on his face and looks contentedly out
the window at all his people at his kingdom below

EXT BONES BUILDING - LATER - DAY

The cop we saw with Jeremiah LUPOVICH and the wannabe
player EDDIE MACK (wearing an old Superfly suit and sleek
black driving gloves) pull up in front of the old stone
building

INT BONES PAD - CONTINUOUS
Shotgun mixes drinks at the bar and hands them to the just

arrived guests Jeremiah Officer Lupovich - looking stiff in
plain clothes - and Eddie Mack in his purple suit

JEREMIAH
Hey Jimmy you know Eddie Mack dont
you

BONES
We met

MACK

Yeah we used to do the after-school b
ball at Kenwood What it is

BONES
What it will be

JEREMIAH
And Officer Lupovich

Bones says nothing Just nods at the cop

MACK
You got a nice crib here

BONES
I do alright Everybodys happy

MACK
But things change You gotta think
ahead

LUPOVICH

They got lotteries all over now Bonesy
Coming here too maybe next year

Bones look sez Bitch dont call me that again

JEREMIAH
Half our old customers are gonna be
getting their people to cross state lines
to pick up lotto tickets
MACK
Besides theres more money to be made in
the gin than the juice What do anybody
want with numbers anyway

BONES
What else Money

MACK
It aint the money - its the high The
big fat floating what if And its way
more profitable Nobody ever wins So
you never have to pay out

BONES
But a two dollar bet is cheaper than a
twenty-dollar bag

MACK
Yeah but I aint talking horse Im
talking about a five-dollar kick in the
head thats a quick ticket to heaven
And the fools keep coming back for more

BONES
Those fools are my people

MACK
Aint no big thang Its just a po
mans free base Here check it out

Eddie pulls a little rock of crack out Jimmy takes it in
his hand and sniffs it Then shrugs and hands it back

BONES
I aint interested And if you gonna
sell it dont sell it round here

MACK
Just try it

BONES
I said no thanks

MACK
Go on It wont kill you

SHOTGUN
Back off Huggybear

MACK
Its like this Jimmy Theres a wave
coming A big ass Krakatoa East of Java
wave And either you gonna be on top of
the wave up there in chocolate heaven or
you gonna be buried neath the muddy
undertow
BONES
Thats cool Totally wide-screen sci-fi
Forward thinking I respect that But
that aint my life Im here and now
Comfortable as a bed bug on a cold night
in a warm nappy dugout Im maintaining
Thats what its about for me And your
twelve and a half-minutes is up

Jimmy just walks away from him Meeting over Eddie and
Lupovich and Jeremiah all look at each other frustrated

MACK
Fine Lets go Loopy-Lou Jimmy aint
into it Gonna skip the money train and
take the bus His loss

Lupovich turns but then spins back around with a 45 in his
hand and its pointed at Jimmys forehead Jeremiah didnt
expect this - or did he

JEREMIAH
Everybody just be cool Jimmy man I
think you oughtta hear the deal

BONES
I dont need to hear the deal I dont
need any partners I dont need new
product And I sure as hell dont need
this motherfuckers mattie in my face

MACK
Just try it Jimmy Thats all

He hands him the rock And a little pipe

LUPOVICH
You heard the man Try it

Bones keeps his eye on him as he lights the lighter and takes
a deep puff Then lets out a deep cloud of smoke

His eyes go a bit glazed And from his POV we see the room
start to tilt on its axis as everything goes wobbly

Just then the door opens and Pearl steps in distracting
Lupovich for an instant

In one eternal crack fueled fast-and-slo-mo second Jimmy
sees his chance he pulls his razor but too slow --

Lupovich turns the razor no more than lightly slices his
arm and he pulls the trigger on Jimmy Bones

Pumping three shots into Jimmys abdomen knocking him to the
ground Shotgun grabs his gun but too late Hes covered
MACK
Aint worth it Blood Just drop it
And kick it here

Pearl in screaming shock Her lover bleeding on the carpet

LUPOVICH
Tell her to stop screaming

Bones is bleeding and still tripping bad

LUPOVICH (CONTD)
I said stop that bitch screaming or Ill
spread her like butter

Shotgun gently puts his hand on Pearls mouth to quiet her
BACK IN BONES FUCKED-UP POV

Looking down he sees his own blood pouring out a thick
divine river of many colors Looking up they all stand
wavering above him hungry demons their voices distorting

LUPOVICH (CONTD)
Get his razor I aint gonna be the only
one with this niggers blood on my hands

Mack plucks Bones silver razor right out of his hands

LUPOVICH (CONTD)
Take the gloves off Everybody leaves a
print We hang out together Or we hang
separately Cut him And cut him good

Eddie pulls his glove off and enjoys himself as he shoves the
razor into Jimmy

MACK
What it is What it will be muthafucka

LUPOVICH
Now you

JEREMIAH
No way man

LUPOVICH
You cut him or I shoot you Make your
choice

Jeremiah gets down near Bones Bones stares right into his
eyes as his life blood pours freely weakly lifts his arm to
his best friends face

BONES
Jay birdhelp melike brothers
Jeremiah feels Lupovichs gun behind his head Hears it
cocked

JEREMIAH
Sorry my brother

BONES
Since we was just grasshoppers

JEREMIAH
You always told me its a dog eat dog
world

And he thrusts Bones razor right between the ribs Bones
eyes tighten but never lose their lock on Jeremiahs eyes
His mouth moves as if hes trying to speak Instead he
spits a bog of blood right into Jeremiahs face

A shaken Jeremiah hands the bloody razor to Shotgun

JEREMIAH (CONTD)
Just do it He wont even feel it

Bones eyes bore into Shotguns Shotgun hesitates Eyeing
his gun on the floor feeling the one on the back of his neck
-- calculating his chances

Then Shotgun slices him Bones flinches he definitely still
feels it Shotgun hands the razor back to Eddie

LUPOVICH
Now you girlie

PEARL
I wont

LUPOVICH
Same deal all around Or die with him

She takes the razor and slowly kneels beside her dying lover
Her hands trembling Theres no way she can do it Lupovich
brings the gun to the back of her head

PEARL
I cant I wont Go ahead Shoot me
Ill be better off

Bones reaches one hand round the back of her neck weakly
storking her there And with his other hand Bones takes
her wrists and pulls her hand towards him burying his razor
in his heart His eyes roll back and his hand falls away and
hes gone

She drops her hand from the razor which remains sticking out
of his chest a river of blood pouring from around it
BONES POV

As his spirit rises and rises up to the ceiling looking
down on them as they stand watching his body bleed to death

Pearl just stands there completely covered in his blood
Then in a frantic daze tears her dress off Jeremiah gently
takes her bloody dress

From above Bones can hear them speaking below but its as
if they were speaking far away

JEREMIAH
Too risky to take him outside Take him
down to the storm cellar and bury him
And get rid of this too
(tosses Pearls bloody dress)
Let this whole damn building be his tomb

Shotgun and Lupovich drag Bones body out of the room
leaving behind a deep wet blood stain in the shag carpet

BONES POV

As he stares down in horror at all this Above him it seems
he can see right through the ceiling to the night sky and a
swirling light opening above his head

NOW HIS POV
Is floating upward towards the light but then he looks
BACK DOWN

Staring down at the sight of his body in a deep puddle of
blood and his murderers removing his womans dress covered
with is blood As he sees this his (and ours) POV changes
becomes darker yet clearer too sharp razor sharp as some
softness perhaps life itself drains out of it Bones sees
his best friend Jeremiah and Lupovich together dragging his
body out the door leaving a thick wet stain behind him

We can hear Jimmys last wail of rage twist and distorts in
the air becoming another deeper voice within the voice
And then he (and we) plunge back down to the ground right to
the dark wet stain in the carpet

Hit it and go down through an instants glimpse into the
black sea beneath the foundation of the world

Necropolis Where space itself seems to be made of pale
bloated gnawing writhing things Bodies perpetually
devouring themselves and each other

We see through this dog-eat-dog nightmare back out through
the blood stain as through a key hole slowly closing

EXT CLUB - LATER
A line out front

PATRICK
Be cool Everybodys gonna get in

Patrick alternates between tending the crowd and throwing
anxious glances down the block towards Cinnabars home

Torn between exhilaration at seeing his dream come true and
disappointment that Cinnabars not there to share it

People chomping to get in Across the street Shotgun watches
with dismay

Patrick hears voices down the street Looks up to see
Cinnabar walking towards the club His smile freezes when he
sees Pearl right behind her Trying to stop Cinn

PEARL
Ive seen things In there Last
night You did too Dont tell me you
didnt You were crying like a baby

CINNABAR
You said the vision the images Theyre
just that Just pictures They cant
hurt you Thats what you always said

PEARL
I lied

CINNABAR
All the more reason I should be here

PEARL
Please Its for your own good

CINNABAR
You said bad things hurt places So
maybe good things heal them Good things
are happening here Maybe for the first
time ever And maybe thats all it
takes

Pearl sees she cant stop Cinn Any more than her mother
could have stopped Pearl when she was her age

PEARL
I hope so child I really hope so

She can only watch as Cinnabar gives Patrick a big hug and
follows him and the rest of the crowd into the club
INT THE BUILDINGCLUB - CONTINUOUS

The place is unfinished But all the cooler for it The bar
is crude Cheap beer and jug wine But the crowd dont
mind The place is alive The boys are on fire

A packed floor of dancers move as sound and image break beat
and Maurices voice erupts in deep dub reverb

MAURICE
The gangsta of love is in the house

Hits the reverb and it echoes

In the househousehouse

ON SCREENS

Throughout the house the video interviews the guys did and
mixed like audio samples with old blaxploitation clips and
other video oddities the boys came up with

MAURICE
Ill Bill is in the househousehouse
house

And over Maurices Gothic drum and bass Bill starts
turntabling some seriously dark funk

INTERCUT WITH THE BLACK DOG
coming ominously down the third floor stairs

MAURICE (CONTD)
Jimmy Bones is in the househouse
house
This is the story of Jimmy Bones Black
as night and hard as stones

The dog now on the second floor stairs

BILL
Bones ol Bones so mean and bad
whupped his mamma shot his dad

MAURICE
Saw Bones ol Bones on top of the hill
Rolling fat jays outta hundred dollar
bills

TIA
Lord he never worked a day and he
never will
Bill builds lets the record spin then pops the kill button
The tune fades in a distorted way as he startstopsstart
stops it forcing the sound backwards and forwards

aS Maurice twiddles dials and distorts it all further --
its spooky but way funky

NEW ANGLE - THE BLACK DOG

Is now in the house too Walking through the throbbing
crowd making a path right through them most of the dancers
paying it no mind its just another part of the trippy
scene Or do they even see it We cant tell

CLOSER ANGLE - ON THE DOG

And its single-minded concentration Staring straight ahead
as it moves through the crowd towards Maurice who for a
second notices the dog coming but making nothing of it

REVERSE - THE DOGS POV
What its staring at Bones old ring on Maurices finger
NEW ANGLE - MAURICES POV

When he looks back he sees not a dog but a beautiful black
woman a Dark Lady who only has eyes for him

Dancing seductively drawing a crowd as she moves she stares
straight ahead at Maurice

Maurices joint droops from the corner of his mouth as he
realizes YES this world-class beauty is most definitely
flirting with him

The Dark Ladys still throwing him deep looks as she dances
off the floor and then disappears up the stairs making
Maurice lean into Bill

MAURICE
Can you take a little extended solo right
about now funk soul brotha

BILL
Go for it

Maurice heads upstairs sure that his short DJ career is
already paying off big time

INT UPSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS

Maurice slips into the darkness of the room and closes the
door behind him

MAURICE
Hey baby Time for a little meat beat
manifesto

In the darkness he cant see where she is Just hear a deep
breathing almost panting

MAURICE (CONTD)
Ahhh tantric breathing Im in love

He cant see her Or anything in the dark room Finally his
eyes adapt to the dark and he sees a dark shape by the bed

MAURICE (CONTD)
Thats it honey Dont need to speak
Jesuis le Gangsta de lamour El Gaucho
della Cosmos We will speak zee
international language of love

He pulls out a lighter to light his joint (and see where she
is) but when he does its not her beautiful dark features he
sees but

For the blink of an eye its totally blank face except for
a HUGE MOUTH with liver lips pink gums and wolfen teeth
When it exhales out comes a noxious cloud of tiny insects
And then in the blink its the raging black dog leaping open
jawed at his face

Maurice screams and drops his light in fright He starts
crawling towards the door and the overhead light switch
While trying to fend himself from the wailing teeth and claws
of the canine creature

INT THE CLUB - CONTINUOUS

Maurices screams are inaudible Just another faint part of
the complicated mix Maurices voice a sample loop is part
of the boys mix

MAURICE (0S)
(voice in music mix)
Jimmy Bones is in the househouse
house

INT UPSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS

Furious flashes and glimpses of savage teeth and claws
ripping Maurice

INT THE CLUB - CONTINUOUS

Bills extended turntablism rocks the house Tia replaces
Patrick behind the bar while Cinnabar drags him on to the
dance floor

INT SUB-BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

Bones-vision movesfloats all the way down to the basement
He squats over his own corpse

Before our eyes (INTERCUT with flashes of the demon-dog
feasting on Maurice upstairs) more and more flesh grows on
the bones of Bones

INT DANCE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

Bill signals Patrick calling him over

BILL
Wheres the gangsta of love

PATRICK
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some
corner

BILL

Well go find his lazy ass I scratch
any more tonight Im gonna have carpal
tunnel syndrome

INT UPSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS
Patrick walks upstairs - we fear he will be next

PATRICK
Yo Maurice Where are you

He tries a door Nothing Then he hears noises from the
third floor

INT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Patrick opens the remaining bedroom door on a nightmare
tableaux Maurice lies in a pool of blood His body shakes
and shudders spasmodically as the dog feasts on his liver

Patrick starts for Maurice but the dog growls to keep him
back away from its precious food Patrick backs up a step
Almost out of his mind with terror He really loses it when
the dog in SLO-MO looks up and directly at him It seems
to be wearing Maurices face and speaks with a twisted
version of his (Maurices) voice

DOGMAURICE
The gangsta of love dont eat no fried
chicken

And before Patrick can even freak the dog has returned to
its normal dog face and it lunges at Patrick taking a
sizeable bite out of his arm
Patrick leaps back out the door with only a fast glance back
at the thing in the room --

The dog is not following him Its standing Over Maurices
remains Growling low it begins to shudder uncontrollably
to bulge and ooze

The gore covered dog quivers and swells and bulges and
finally explodes into a shower of pulsating maggots flying
all over the room and all over Patricks eyes and in his
mouth

INT BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

The body is now done It looks whole again Even strong and
young If still gray and cold until Bones lies down curls
up into the body filling the rejuvenated corpse with the
vital life force of his vengeful rage

BonesThe Body opens his eyes stands up not tottering as
before but filled with strength He looks as good as new
except for the tattered clothes

ON THE DANCE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

The dancers cant hear Patrick screaming or running down the
stairs Theyre just groovin along to Ill Bill and the
funk

Until the maggots start oozing and pouring through the
ceiling onto their hair and faces and clothes into their
drinks at the bar and onto their pizza slices

Then Patrick comes into the room screaming and all hell
breaks loose as the sight of him plus the maggots sends
everyone tearing for the exits

Seeing his brother in terror Bill slams the tone arm
screeching the needle across the record leaving only the
psycho drum and bass playing on the other channels of the
mix

INT BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

Meanwhile down below the freshly embodied Bones studies the
gas furnace This time when he bends down to blow out the
light -- wooosh he blows it out He reaches under the tank
and the gas hisses out

Then he eyes his old razor on the floor With a confident
strong grip he picks it up and now finally --

BONES IS BACK IN BUSINESS
INT DANCE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

Hell-maggots still falling onto people maggots on the floor
making people slip and fall as they jam the exits Screaming
chaos people trying to break windows to get out faster

Patrick looks across the chaotic room and sees Cinnabar and
Tia cringing under a table Trapped there Bill in the
doorway trying to get people out

INT BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

At the top of the stairs leading up out of the sub basement
Bones smashes the bulb of the hanging light Then flips the
light switch -- the spark ignites the gas behind him It
causes a fiery explosion in the lower basement

The fires light seems the very glow of hellfire behind Bones
as he marches up the stairs razor in his hand

INT DANCE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

Patrick trying to stay low crawls his way to where his
sister and Cinnabar are trapped

Fire begins to burn through from the kitchen and up through
the floor The room is filling with smoke

Bills helping those trampled in the rush to get out Bill
himself bleeds badly from his neck

Patrick runs with Cinnabar and Tia toward the door And as
the smoke fills the room through the haze we see

Bones step into the room His arm raised with the razor
And he flings it out like a boomerang the razor flies
around the room

It swoops down through the smoke at the remaining kids
hacking at them through the smoke like some savage bird
though it doesnt seem intent on slaughtering them but
rather herding them out Bill and Patrick pull Cinnabar and
Tia out the door -- theyre the last in the room

Suddenly the razor stops freezes in mid-air and zips back
into Bones waiting fist - just like a boomerang

Razor held high Bones advances on them steadily cool as
ice amidst the now fully burning house

EXT STREET - CONTINUOUS

Shotgun Pearl and a few others have run out into the street
to watch the fire In the distance sirens already wail
Pearl holds her breath until she sees Cinnabar safe

Looking for an instant they all see Bones as the room is
engulfed in flames See him raise his fists in a rage Or
is it in triumph Before his figure is obscured by falling
debris
Sirens wail as fire trucks pull up and the men start
unrolling a hose But freeze at the cocking of the shotgun

SHOTGUN
Unh-unh Let it burn

The rising flames illuminate the faces of spectators
Especially shotgun and Pearl who for the first time in 20

years look each other straight in the eyes

SHOTGUN (CONTD)
We shoulda done this a long time ago

PEARL
I dont know

Her flame-reflecting eyes telling us her fear this may be a
huge mistake

INT BONES HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

In the burning room we see Bones oblivious to the flames
climbing the stairs

INTO HIS HOLD ROOM WHERE

He comes to whats left of Maurice Finds his hand bloodied
and barely attached to the wrist and on it -- Bones ring

BONES
You wont be needing this

Bones slips it onto his stump of a finger
INT POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS

Patrick and the others sit ashen-faced under questioning by
cops and arson investigators

INVESTIGATOR
Flying razor big black man spontaneous
explosion I got just one question what
the hell narcotic were you all on

PATRICK
We never did that OnlyMaurice was
into it

COP

BILL

The Gangsta of Love

He breaks down Just then Jeremiah walks in with a lawyer
JEREMIAH
None of you say another word

INT PEARLS STOREFRONT - CONTINUOUS
Cinnabar is crying Pearl holding her

PEARL

CINNABAR

PEARL
If he was trying to kill you youd be

CINNABAR

Who Who is he What is he

PEARL
Your father He was your father

INT CAR - LATER THAT NIGHT

Jeremiah drives his still shocked and silent brood back to
safety behind the gates of Rossmore Park

JEREMIAH
I dont want any of you ever back down

INT PEARLS STOREFRONT - CONTINUOUS
Cinnabar listening to her mother is told what happened

PEARL

- we - killed him that you were already
alive inside me Lifes like that
Grows right out of death

CINNABAR
But if its him If hes really come

PEARL
Sure if it was really him But it isnt
that simple Jimmys body died a long
time ago And his soul is long gone and
all thats left is that ravening hungry
spirit in the blood that soaked into the
house itself I suppose
CINNABAR
But how do you know Maybe he just
wanted to see us And now hes gone
again And youve all killed my father
for the second time

Cinnabar runs crying out of the room

EXT BACK ON THE STREET - PRE-DAWN

The building is finished just a blackened shell Remnants
of the staircase lead up to fragments of the upper floors
Smoke still billowing from the empty center of the ruin

Silhouetted in the smoke and the low light of the rising sun
a tall dark figure not of then nor quite of now

It is Bones Taller thinner darker and more menacing then
ever But unmistakably Bones He steps out of the rubble
And looks across the street up at Shotguns lit window

INT SHOTGUNS APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Shotguns hand shakes as he pours another shot Then downs
it He turns to the window and freezes at what he sees

Bones face is just outside the window The second story
window Smiling in at him Shotgun is petrified But then
he picks up his gun and shoots at the face in the window

BONES (0S)
Free at last free at last

Shotgun whirls and there stands Bones behind him now

SHOTGUN
It wasnt my fault I didnt know what
theyd planned

BONES
Shush It dont matter now

SHOTGUN
No Really Jimmy Remember man Its
me I was on your side Dont you
remember

He just walks towards the terrified Shotgun closer and
closer leaning right over his shotgun his face coming just

inches from Shotguns face

BONES
Take a look at what I remember
brother

His big brown eyes fill Shotguns vision and in what now
seem to be the gigantic pupils in Bones eyes Shotgun sees
the old apartment and there it all is again and again

Shotgun sees himself hesitating almost risking it all and
instead giving in stabbing Bones -- he cant look away
Then Bones closes his eyes Shotgun sobbing now

SHOTGUN
I had no choice Jimmy What else could
I do

BONES

You coulda died with me Died trying

Shotgun is cradling his weapon hands shaking He points it
at Bones and pulls the trigger Bones doesnt even flinch as
the pellets rip through him

BONES (CONTD)
Feel better

Bones impossibly long fingers hold his long rusty razor He
waves the razor in front of Shotgun the rusty blade swinging
free back and forth hypnotically with a rasping sound

BONES (CONTD)
You gonna be free and clear Shotgun
All debts paid

And then in one swift motion on the back stroke Bones hand
and razor slash across Shotguns throat

Shotgun doesnt even have time to scream we just hear his
breath and blood escaping from the new opening across his
neck

Bones bends down and cradling his old friend whispers gently
into his ear Singing perhaps We cant quite hear

BONES (CONTD)
See you on the other side brother

Bones gets up and moves around the room standing before the
window and looking down at the neighborhood he used to own

For a second he sees the old neighborhood everybody hanging
out Then he blinks back to reality He looks down the
block and sees Pearls reader and advisor sign

INT JEREMIAHS HOUSE - DAY

Bill in a kind of shock can only lie in his bedroom staring
at the ceiling
Tias out in the living room sitting on the couch weeping in
her mothers arms

Patricks in the bathroom tending the bloody scratches on his
back and arms Hes frightened And angry He storms out
of the bathroom down the hall to his fathers office

INT JEREMIAHS STUDY - CONTINUOUS

As Patrick slams the door behind him Jeremiah hides a stack
of papers and photos beneath a pile on his desk

PATRICK
Did you do it

JEREMIAH
Sure son I went down there and torched
the place myself

PATRICK
You could have had it done You didnt
want us there

JEREMIAH
I wouldnt have risked killing you to get
you out I was trying to protect you

PATRICK
From what

Jeremiah cant answer But Patricks not leaving it alone

PATRICK (CONTD)
Why Why did you give a shit about the
building Why did you care that we were
there of all places

JEREMIAH
Itsits a bad neighborhood As you
can see now

PATRICK
Bullshit Dad Dont front me For
once Just tell me the truth I came
from there too

JEREMIAH
You were just a kid

PATRICK
I saw your face You knew that place
You knew those people

JEREMIAH
Thats the past Its dead
PATRICK
Dead I dont think your past is dead
(points to the bandages
Its alive And it bites

EXT BLACKSTONE STREET - NIGHT

That night we see a walking shadow The long tall black clad
Bones Heading down his old block Alone

As he moves his face changes at times demonic and intent
But periodically that shifts as if a mask slipping off to
reveal a similar but different face below More human lost
pained confused and we see why

FROM BONES FUCKED UP UNDEAD POV

The dark and desolate street he walks down keeps flashing for
brief instants into the street of twenty years ago

One moment people nodding to him waving blowing kisses
And then suddenly its the empty burnt block it is now

Bones face shifts cracking one second the hungry ghost
The next hes the old Bones who once ruled this ‘hood

He sees down the block the old palmistry sign Its
Pearls place For a second the face of the real Jimmy
Bones triumphs and he smiles Then hears voices behind him

Stank and Weaze They see a tall thin figure in some very
fine looking long duster

STANK
Looking to score

BONES
Unh-unh little brother I got a natural
high A supernatural high

STANK
Hey Eddie Mack dont like no wackos on
his street Go be Rain Man on some other
bitchs block

BONES
(sorta singing)
Big Bad Eddie Mack Got shit for brains
and thats a fack Hey-heh

WEAZE
Yeah But he got a baaaad coat Whataya
say bro I check out your coat

BONES
Sure Here it is
Suddenly out from the depths of his shadow flies the edge
of Bones razor and the blade slashes Stank in the face
Cutting a sideways smart aleck smile in his cheek

Weaze pulls a gun and shoots Bones Bones jolts a little as
the bullet imbeds itself in his stomach But he takes it
like a punch and looks up

BONES (CONTD)
Cut that shit out

He grabs one of the boys in each long hand and hoists them up
to his height and pins them against the wall

BONES (CONTD)
You tell my old friend Mackie Ill be
seeing him Soon Real soon

STANK
Wh-wh-whooo

BONES

INT PEARLS PARLOR - NIGHT

Pearl sits alone drinking Maybe crying a little Her
hands shuffle large tarot cards She lays her own spread
First card face down Second card face up

THE LOVERS

And across it the third is laid the crumbling Tower

Then she slips the first card the down-turned card out and
flips it face up Death Suddenly a long black shadow falls

over the table

PEARL
(without looking up)
Welcome back lover

She finally looks up at him
PEARL (CONTD)
Not so bad Youre not quite him But
youre not the shaggy demon I expected
neither

His face quivers and we see from his POV

Pearl - then and now Again then and now
PEARL (CONTD)

You look confused The dead often are
Course so are the living Take me I
been confused a long time Least twenty
years Maybe if I hadnta walked in at
that moment Or maybe if I hadnta let
you go at all I figure one way or the
other I killed you So its only fair
kill me lover I dont mind Ill even
help you The way you helped me

She grabs his hand tries to stab herself with his razor
But he resists Pulls his arm free

PEARL (CONTD)
No That mean theres something more
left of you than just that hungry spirit
What are you going to do now Kill us
Kill us all

BONES
No Notnot you You I forgive

She hurls herself at him Slapping him Slamming her fists
against his shadowy chest

PEARL
Forgive me The hell with you Jimmy
Cause I dont forgive you I dont
forgive you for dying And for being so
goddamn stubborn Or for haunting my
dreams And I dont forgive you for
anything youre about to do

He looks down at her His face wavering between the true
face of Jimmy Bones and the angry Bones ready to kill her

Then he wraps his arms around her and they kiss She faints
the cards in her fist fluttering to the floor

He lays her gently down When suddenly Cinnabar throws the
door open

She and Bones make eye contact She sets eyes for the first
time on the father shes never known And in the blink of
her eye hes gone She runs to where her mom lies on the
floor

EXT BLACK CAT POOL CLUB - NIGHT

Stank and Weaze with Eddie Mack whos getting a manicure
from a coke whore

MACK
You boys been hitting the pipe

WEAZE
No Eddie Its just that I dunno He
was tall and thin and like a shadow
his face was just a blur All I remember
is the voice It was smooth and low and
it didnt seem to be comin out of his
mouth

MACK
Then howd you hear it fool

WEAZE
It was just like in my head

MACK
Maybe I oughta open a couple holes in
that head and let all them voices out
Youll feel better I promise

STANK
No Eddie man Wait

But hes not about to shoot him He leans over and snorts a
line of white powder off the mirrored tray

MACK
I told you not to lie to me Now what
the hell happened

COKE WHORE
(needs a hit)
What about me baby

MACK
Shutup bitch Now what he just said to
tell you what He was back Who was

STANK
Bones

At the very sound of the name Mack freezes Then with
sudden coke-fueled ferocity he whips around and starts
smacking the shit out of Stank breaking his nose The coke
whore cheering Eddie on Wanting to see more action

MACK
Bones What the fuck is that supposed to
mean Get the fuck out of here Both of
you fore you hear my voice up in yo
head

INT PEARLS STOREFRONT - NIGHT

Cinnabar pours some bourbon into a coke for her mother But
Pearl just grabs the bottle and takes a straight hit

PEARL
Hell kill them Hell kill every last
one of them

CINNABAR
Who

PEARL
Eddie Mack that cop And Jeremiah And
even when hes done who knows He wont

be satisfied Just like that demon dog
Feed it and it just grows hungrier
Feed his hunger for revenge - he just
wants more Who knows where itll stop
That kind of hunger aint never
satisfied

CINNABAR
Arent you gonna do something about it

PEARL
Like what I got a little power sure
A touch of the shining a little of the
sight But no more than you do Were
not witches I cant wiggle my nose or
say a magic word and make him go away
Besides maybe they deserve it Maybe we
all do

CINNABAR
I dont Patrick doesnt And his
brother and sister dont And theyre in
the house with him

PEARL
(long beat)
Fine Maybe I got nothing to lose
Cept you

INT BLACK CAT POOL CLUB - NIGHT

The lights are low and only the glow of the jukebox and the
sounds of Harold Melvin and the Bluenotes as Mack and his
manicurist get down on the pooltable beside an ornate mirror
laden with two gold 45s and an ounce of cocaine Which they
are both doing to excess

Macks wearing nothing but a black hat and black satin briefs
(not a pretty sight) Working now on her blouse

MACK
Bones my ass
(sings while unbuttoning the
manicurists blouse)
if you dont believe hes laid to
restYou count the holes in his
motherfucking chest
She laughs and gets up

COKE WHORE
That tickles I want to hear that again

He watches her sashay to the other room where the juke box
is Then bends over the mirror to do a new line

From the other room the song changes A deep menacing
rolling funk number

MACK
Thats it baby Gimme the rolling bass
and Ill tickle your tweeter all night
long

INT CLUBROOM - CONTINUOUS

Babys standing wide-eyed next to the jukebox staring at
Bones his razor pressed against her quivering lips

INT BLACK CAT POOL CLUB - CONTINUOUS
Macks wondering where she is

MACK
Cmon baby

He walks doing a little funky Rufus Thomas shuffle to the
music He steps into the club room Its dark lit only by
the jukebox But its empty

MACK (CONTD)
Bitch Nobody walks out on Eddie Mack

Then he sees something Her legs on the floor sticking out
behind the jukebox He walks towards her slowly

Then sees the deepening pool of blood pouring across the
floor right towards him Whatever happened to her shes
beyond his help now

MACK (CONTD)
Muthafucka

He whips around but cant see anyone He strides defiantly
back into the pool room

MACK (CONTD)
Cmon I take you all on

Mack picks up the two gold plated revolvers off the mirror
with coke on it Suddenly all the coke moves on its own
The many grams piled there all merge into one pile

MACK (CONTD)
What the
He bends down to check it out And the coke actually flies
straight up off the mirror with the force of a punch and
shoots like a fire hose straight up his nose

He reels back choking Coughing After having probably an
ounce fly straight up his snot-locker Blood pouring out his
nose Wobbly now

He hears a low echoing laughter through the club and the
sound of the cue ball breaking and sending pool balls
spinning round the table

MACK (CONTD)
Whos there

Bones stands by the pool table under the overhanging light
He pulls out his razor and with one savage slice splinters
the pool cue in two

MACK (CONTD)
Bones Jimmy Bones That you Youre
dead I killed you and I stuck your dead
ass in a hole in the ground wrapped in
nothing but your bitchs bloody rags
Now Ill count the holes in your
muthafuckin chest And Ill add a few
more

He fires both guns at Bones while backing away Bones dont
feel a thing He just picks up the mirror and holds it up
facing Mack

BONES
This it Your big-ass tidal wave

Mack sees his own terrified face staring back from the
mirror belling hanging over his briefs coke and blood
clotted on his face

BONES (CONTD)
Look like the waves long gone and
nothing but oil scum dead fish and yo
ugly ass left on the beach

Mack shoots wildly at Bones At the mirror - blasting it
into shards

But Bones stands unscathed And the shards of broken mirror
do not fall to the ground They remain in the air forming a
living room swarm of razor sharp glass

Mack turns and runs waaaaay too fucking late as the swarm
of glass shards fly like angry wasps right at him

Eddies thrown forward by the sheer force of them and is
skewered throughout his body by all the glass fragments
Pinned -- face mashed against the wall

BONES (CONTD)
(Macks voice)
Im taking a five dollar kick in the
head thats a quick ticket to heaven

Mack pinned to the wall Bleeding from everywhere Snot
blood-coke mess drips out his nose Bones pulls Macks head
back by his hair and slides his razor into the half inch
between his Adams apple and the wall

As the juke box changes song we hear a liquid slice and a
scream slip into a gurgle

Bones long hands drip blood as he ties something to his
belt We dont quite see what it is not until we catch the
sight of Eddie Macks headless remains pinned to the wall

INT POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Lupovich is at his desk finishing off a huge Polish sausage
Talking on the phone A cop named SAL is nearby tidying up

LUPOVICH

SAL

EXT ALLWAY - NIGHT

Bones walks the night with a slicing stride His legs
stretching too far and somehow covering long distance in an
instant And in slo-motion like a nightmare marionette a
walking shadow or some great black grasshopper
MACKS SEVERED HEAD (0S)
(as if swinging back and forth)
Bones Bones you muthafuckah What the
hell you done to me

Bones stops for a moment and looks down at his waist and we
see Macks severed head tied to Bones belt Severed yet
seemingly alive

BONES
Not half what Im planning on

MACKS SEVERED HEAD
This some sick fucked up shit What you
want with my head

BONES
Just using it to carry your soul

MACKS SEVERED HEAD
My soul Fuck you Look I killed you

Bones got no time to argue He bends and picks up a handful
of fetid city garbage

MACKS SEVERED HEAD (CONTD)
were even No need to get all meta
fucking-phys-i-gack

And shoves it into the still talking mouth of Mack
EXT SOUTHWEST SIDE - NIGHT

Bright loud summer night Blues coming from inside a blues
bar the guy playing Killin Floor

Lupovich heads toward the Armor building From a distance
he sees a young runner emerge from a passage on the farside
of the building then set off to meet his mark Lupovich
heads for the passage the music following him

Lupovich looks around to make sure no one is watching Then
slips into a passageway leading to the old slaughterhouse

A scary walk through inky darkness scattered with broken
glass and scurrying rats and lit only by the eerie red light
spilling like blood out of the open door into the old
slaughterhouse at the end of the way

Lupovich reaches the back right next to the old loading dock
where the still-livestock were unloaded He enters the door
disappearing into the red darkness

INT SLAUGHTERHOUSE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

The room large and open soaked in the sodium vapor that
streams through the tall windows from the streetlights

There are a few blood rusted meat hooks still there backlit
hanging from the ceiling Graffiti covers the walls with
arcane tags and symbols The floors are caked with a sticky
grime turned black in the orange haze

In the far corner burn three red votive candles Behind the
candles lies a crumpled brown paper bag The stash

Lupovich starts over to the corner twitching at the gross
sound of his shoes sticking to the layers of old coagulated
blood on the killing floor

Behind him framed for an instant int he doorway - a tall
sharp shadow a walking razor - Bones

The walk is tense Somehow the music has followed him here
and is echoing and wailing in the walls around him He gets
to the corner and reaching over the candles opens the top
of the paper bag Jackpot Five ziplocks of the rocks

He hears a noise Lupovich fumbles for his gun and at the
same time reaches to snatch the stash bag His wrist touches
the candles flame and it burns

LUPOVICH
Shit Fuck

He hears another noise a blade scraping on concrete right
behind him Now the music blends with the echoing squeals of
the hogs once butchered on the cutting line

Lupovich hears another noise a blade scraping on concrete
right behind him Now the music blends with the echoing
squeals of the hogs once butchered on the cutting line

Lupovich turns and there towering over him stands Bones
And just as startling theres Macks laughing severed head
swinging from his belt

Lupovich can only choke on his terror and while his mouth is
open Bones shoves a glass pipe into it

Brandishing his razor Bones packs a rock into the bowl and
torches it He holds the razor to Lupovichs throat

BONES
(in Macks voice)
Just try itgo aheadit wont kill
you

Lupovich trembling takes a massive hit of the crack deep
into his lungs The music and the sounds of the dying pigs
attack him as the coke fills his lungs and then his blood and
then his brain his eyes starting to bug
Bones then knocks the pipe from his lips and seals his hand
over Lupovichs mouth and nose He cant exhale The sounds
get louder the grafted walls come alive

Bones removes his hand revealing Lupovichs nose is fused
shut and his mouth is simply gone the skin flat where the
mouth used to be

Lupovichs gotta lung full of crack and no way to exhale
Severed Mack laughs insanely as he sees Lupovichs eyes bulge
as his lungs start to strain under the agony

His frenzied suffocation is nothing but pure torture While
he is still kicking with the fear and the drug rush Bones
drags Lupovich to the middle of the room

With one arm Bones lifts the fat cop up and hooks him to one
of the meat hooks above

BONES (CONTD)
(in Lupovichs voice)
I aint gonna be the only one with this
niggers blood on my hands

As Lupovich squirms Bones takes his blade and shoves it in
just below Lupovichs sternum And a spray of blood paints
Bones and Macks hanging head

Thick crack smoke emerges from the wound and floats foglike
out of the chest cavity Bones then yanks the blade
southward and slices the cops belly wide open

We hear Lupovichs guts spill out on the floor

MACKS SEVERED HEAD
Was that really necessary Can you wipe
my fucking face I cant see a goddamned
thing

The dope smoke wafts in the room four feet off the floor
The song immolates itself Blood drips And Bones adds
another weight to his belt

EXT ROSSMORE PARK - NIGHT

Just round the corner from the entrance to the gated suburb
Cinnabar and Pearl On foot

PEARL
Well have to sneak in

CINNABAR
No we wont Momma I1l just have them

PEARL
Girl they build gates like that to keep

Cinnabar walks up to the guard at the gate He picks up the
phone to check

INT PEET HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Phone rings Patrick grabs it But his fathers already on
the other end

GUARD

EXT ROSSMORE GATE - CONTINUOUS
The rent-a-cop hangs up the phone and shakes his head

GUARD
Sorry Miss

CINNABAR

GUARD
Sure But not from here Nearest public
phone would be back a few miles Outside
the mall

Cinnabar sees its useless to argue and walks away Shocked
and hurt Back to where her mother stands in the shadows
outside the gates

PEARL
Told you so Alright We tried Lets
go home

CINNABAR

Mother No
Hear a voice from the other side of the gate

PATRICK
Cinnabar Walk around the north side
Theres an opening there

EXT MAIN GATE - CONTINUOUS

As they sneak around the other side a dark figure steps
right up to the main gates

The rent-a-cop wakes up fast when he sees Bones standing in
front of him
After all how often does he come face to face with
everything he is there to keep out He hitches his belt in
best John Wayne style

GUARD
Can I help y--

but then he notices the two-severed heads swinging from
Bones belt All three of them smile

MACKS SEVERED HEAD
Can Jeremiah come out and play

EXT NORTH WOODED SIDE - CONTINUOUS
The other outer edge of the sub-development Patrick leads

them in through some bushes and behind some of the pipe and
power systems of the subdivision

CINNABAR
Why couldnt you just tell him to let us
in

PATRICK

My old man calls the shots He built
that gate and these damn walls

PEARL
(to Cinnabar)
You sure we oughta save him Why not
just let see how safe his gates and walls
keep him when his past comes calling

PATRICK
Save him What are you talking about

INT JEREMIAHS STUDY - CONTINUOUS

Jeremiah locks the door to his study Then he pulls out the
stack he hid on his desk A dusty manila envelope Inside
photos the old days His first wife His first life Back
in the old neighborhood Him and his best friend Jimmy Bones
as children teenagers and as adults

BONES (0S)
Hey brotha What it is

And Bones stands right behind him Severed heads hanging
from his belt

BONES (CONTD)
What it will be

JEREMIAH
How did you get in here

BONES
Time like this is that what you really
want to know How I got the fuck in
here

EXT MAIN GATE - CONTINUOUS

A car drives up to the gate But no guard comes out to check
it out The driver of the car honks But no response

Just the aimless squawk of the radio in the booth Cant
really see into the tooth The windows are splattered and
obscured by deep red stains

INT PEET HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Patrick runs in with Cinnabar and pearl past a startled
Nancy

PATRICK
Wheres Dad

NANCY
His study Whore your friends

But they run right past Though Pearl gives a kind of half
wave hi-hello

Patrick runs down the hall to his fathers study The doors
locked From the inside he pounds on it

PATRICK
Dad Open up Dad

Bill and Tia stick their heads out to see what all the racket
is

PATRICK (CONTD)
Cmon We got to get in there

Bill and Patrick slam against the door Finally it gives way
and they both tumble through the broken door into the room

INT JEREMIAHS STUDY - CONTINUOUS
But its empty Jeremiahs not there
EXT BONES BUILDING - NIGHT

A strange greenish fog up and down the street emanating from
the burnt out shell of the building

INT BONES BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

High in the center where the master bedroom once was we see
a kind of mirage forming Another image of the room still
there vaguely luminescent in the night
INT PEET HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Theyre in shock

BILL
We cant go back there Are you crazy
You saw --

PEARL

Its the only way Its possible your
father may not be dead yet

They look around at the mess in the room Over turned chair
Signs of struggle Spatters of blood

PEARL (CONTD)
Your father was his best friend He
loved Jeremiah So he must hate him the
most of all now Hell take his time
But even if it is too late If your
father is dead Its not over The door
has to be closed

BILL
Well close the fucking door by all
means But dont expect me to go down
there and do it

PEARL
I dont

She gets up to go Cinnabar stands too

PATRICK
You aint going down there Not alone
Ill go

BILL
Fine But Im bringing a couple of
friends

He steps out of the room and comes back with a gun anda
knife in a sheath on his belt

PEARL
They wont do you no good

Bill with a defiant well it cant hurt look Nancy
appears in the doorway as they hurry out seeing Bill with
the gun in his hand

NANCY

police and 911

PATRICK

INT BONES BUILDINGNECROPOLIS VERSION - ETERNAL NIGHT

It is Bones old bedroom The Necropolois version The
floor the walls the furniture everything in it -- formed
out of the wracked and twisted shapes of dead souls

This is that same version of the room weve glimpsed before
And it remains even when the real room has burnt away

INT BONES BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Bones there in the flesh with Jeremiah on his knees Bones
untying the heads from his belt

BONES
You two bitches were just meat never had
any idea smarter than getting yourself a
little more But my brother Jaybird
here He was smart He didnt just want
more He wanted more with compound
interest

Bones shoves the screaming severed heads through the undead
wall of the Necropolis

SEVERED HEADS POV

For only a flashcut moment we see the heads see coming at
them - reaching for them Laughing at them The undead

BONES (CONTD)
Time for him to collect his interest
Jeremiahs gonna have the unique
experience of seeing his reward tasting
it while hes still alive

Bones wraps his long arm around Jeremiahs neck ina
brotherly choke hold Jeremiah terrified

EXT LAKE SHORE DRIVE - NIGHT
Pearl Cinnabar Bill and Patrick speed south by car

PEARL
see there aint just two parts toa
person Theres three Body-Soul and
Spirit The spirit lives in the blood
Its the wanting that holds body and soul
together and sometimes the wanting
lives on Jimmys blood must still be in
the house

PATRICK

But the place burned to the ground

PEARL

The blood is still there We just gotta
figure out where

CINNABAR

In his grave there was a cloth or a dress
or something Covered with blood

My God

PEARL
My dress We have to find it

And burn it And shut the door

Bill and Patrick look at Pearl like she might be crazy Then
they see Cinnabar next to her glaring back at them

INT BONES BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Bones has Jeremiah on his feet now leading him towards the
wall of the undead

Suddenly hands shoot out of the wall only inches away from

Jeremiahs face

He twists and turns to stay away from them

but the long nails on one of the hands claw at his cheek
While hungry mouths open from the palms of hands

BONES

(keeping Jeremiah out from

hands reach)
I dont understand it You were my Man
Since we was grasshoppas I always
looked after you You had a piece of
everything I had

JEREMIAH

I didnt want a piece of yours I wanted

my own

BONES

And the hell everybody else right

Bones pushing Jeremiahs face towards the grasping hands

JEREMIAH

Wait Jimmy Think about it You woulda
done the same thing if you was me

BONES

No brother I wouldnta I never done a
man - any man Let alone a brother like

that

Course aS you can see no good
deed goes unfucked Now the question is
if the good get fucked what we got saved
up for the bad You about to find out

Bones rams Jeremiahs head (his eyes closed in fear) through
the Necropolis wall

INT NECROPOLIS WALL - CONTINUOUS

Jeremiahs head inside now Eyes still closed head bobbing
in the jelly-like base that holds what he sees when he dares
to open his eyes

Hideous malformed faces genetic anomalies the kinds of
faces that wound up in side-shows in less enlightened times
All laughing and leering and glaring at Jeremiah

FULL CU - LUPOVICHS FACE AND HEAD

The skin peeling away like congealed jelly lLupovich tries
to talk to Jeremiah or to scream but nothing comes out
Except for a hideous wobbling bubble

For a subliminal moment Jeremiah sees a figure trapped
inside the bubble His own figure silently screaming to get
out

NEW ANGLE

Suddenly Jeremiah is screaming for real as Bones has just
yanked his head back out of the wall

BONES
Its a trip aint it

Bones sounding almost sympathetic to Jeremiah Almost

EXT BONES NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

Suddenly as they round a corner onto Blackstone they see
tendrils of an eerie greenish fog It seems to be emanating
from the still smoking remains of Bones house Or perhaps
it is just the smoke tinged only by the gaseous street
lights

PEARL
Weve got to hurry Weve got to shut
the door Theyre getting out

Then theres a shape and a thump The real terror of
thinking your car just hit a human being

Then a face appears in the car window Just a homeless guy
shaking an angry fist at them Quickly hes gone in the
fog

Straining to see Patrick stops grabbing a flashlight from
his glove box They all get out Making their way through
the fog glimpsing in darkened doorways eerie shapes
perhaps more of the dead out of Necropolis

EXT BEHIND THE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

They arrive at the back side of the ruined building

PATRICK
There was a storm door to the cellar

They search frantically in the dark amongst the tall weeds
abandoned junk and burnt rubble

INT BONES BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Jeremiah still with Bones looking for a way out

JEREMIAH
What will it take What do you want
Just tell me Jimmy

BONES
Aw thats easy I want my life back
Can you swing that my brother

JEREMIAH
You know I cant

BONES
Then fuck it

In a righteous fury Bones headlocks Jeremiah again and rams
his head through the Necropolis wall

OVER JEREMIAHS SHOULDER - HIS POV

As hes back inside face to face with living dead mutations
with Lupovichs head coming at him its mouth suddenly
opening to ten times its normal size swallowing Jeremiah
whole

BACK WITH BONES

Watching with some pity as the rest of Jeremiah his legs and
feet are pulled into the wall and gone Accompanied by the
disappearing screams of the last of Jeremiah

BONES (CONTD)
(sadly)
Dog eat dog brother Dog eat dog

EXT BEHIND THE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
They search for the cellar door The night air is shattered
by a scream at once very close and infinitely far Finally

BILL
Here

Hes found a chipped gray storm door Patrick easily kicks
in the rotten wood revealing a dark tunnel of stairs leading
down beneath the ruins of the building into the sub-basement

PATRICK
Its not safe down there The fire
started down there The whole thing
could collapse

PEARL
Then your fathers a dead man and Jimmy
Bones is gonna be around a long time

Patrick steps down into the darkness of the cellar his
flashlight on

INT STORM CELLAR - CONTINUOUS

The group stoops low as they descend the stairs Beneath
wood supports the dirt is reclaiming it already a constant
trickle of dirty falling from between the boards

In the dim Patrick leads them walking through a mass of
spider infested webs and just ahead is the sub-basement
where they originally found the body

INT SUB-BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

Throwing debris aside they come next through a small door at
the bottom of the stairs and enter the sub-basement Nearby
is the elevator shaft a gaping hole in the ruins - but
recognizable as such The ceiling above them is nearly
collapsed and over most of the room the accumulated debris
and ruin from above has simply fallen through

And what remains of the ceiling is still shifting groaning
coming apart

Patrick shines his flashlight down to the ground until

PATRICK
Here

Hes found the hole that was Bones hastily dug grave but
theres nothing in it now but swarming white maggots

PEARL
Is it there

She gets down on her hands and knees as Patrick shines the
light but after a few frantic moments of digging its
clear

PEARL (CONTD)
Its gone He got it

Just then the sound of tremendous strain and creaking of
wood And the ceiling starts to give way They all scramble
for shelter and then it gives way completely -- completely
blocking their way out Theyre trapped

BILL

They all look in every direction for some glimpse of hope -
of a way out There is none Then they hear behind them a
resonant DING

TURNING - THEIR POV

Where moments before there was a gaping ruined elevator
shaft there is now a fully functioning elevator just as it
was in 1979 the doors opening to them in eerie slo-mo

Pearl starts towards the open car The others trying to hold
her back

PEARL
Its alright Let me

She walks closer peering into the dark recesses of the
elevator Maybe again a flash of visible movement inside

Closer ever closer until Pearl almost entranced steps in
And once inside theres no one or no thing there Pearl
is about to tell them Its okay when suddenly the doors
of the elevator slide-slam shut

CINNABAR

Then they hear the elevator chain start to move and the
elevator starts to rise Cinnabar screaming louder

INT THE ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

Pearl stands there summoning all her courage for what she
knows shes going to have to face Watching the elevator
arrow as it climbs to the number three

INT SUB-BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

Patrick and Bill beat on the door and try to pry it open
Then they try jamming jagged boards into the opening but
still to no avail

PEARLS POV
As a moment later the car stops and the doors open onto

INT BONES PAD - CONTINUOUS

Down to the last detail exactly as it was 22 years ago the
night Bones died Music playing (the Delfonics Didnt I
Blow Your Mind This Time) The only new detail are the
dozens of candles romantically burning everywhere

BONES (0S)
Hey baby

Pearl feels a soft touch on the back of her neck and spins
finds Jimmy right behind almost nuzzling her His face
hidden though in darkness Holding something in his hand
behind his back

PEARL
(still with her back to him)
Jimmy youve got --

BONES
Ive got what I want Turn around baby
look at me Look at your man

She turns slowly and we dont know what to expect
Something horrible or something beautiful

Finally shes face to face and its Jimmy just as he was
22 years ago All traces of the demonic are gone Pearl
melts as the Delfonics swell Jimmy holding her close

BONES (CONTD)
I want you to do something for me baby

PEARL
What

We see what hes holding the dress Rotted and blood
clotted and ruined

BONES
I always loved you in this dress

He holds it up for Pearl to see and from
HER POV

The dress is brand new and beautiful Shes finally
entranced

INT THE SUB-BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

Patrick Bill and Cinnabar have managed now to pry open the
elevators outer doors They step inside on the soft ashen
ground and look up
THEIR POV

The shaft goes all the way into eternity But along the
tacked walls they see hand and footholds put there for
workers

PATRICK
We can climb out

BILL
Climb out to where

PATRICK
Anywhere but here

One by one they start to climb Bill first As they climb
they become aware of light on the first floor level just
ahead

BACK IN BONES CRIB

Pearl steps into the frame to look at herself in a floor
length mirror on Bones closest door

PEARLS POV - IN THE MIRROR

Not only the dress but she too looks exactly as she was 22
years ago skin smooth as cocoa butter eyes free from worry
and pain

Roberta Flacks Killing Me Softly as Jimmy takes her in his
arms and starts to slow dance her in the midst of all those
candles

PEARL
Where are we baby

BONES
Where well always be

PEARL
But

BONES
Hush baby

Pulls her closer closer until her last misgivings are gone
Whatever purpose she came with lost in the power of having
the impossible

INT THE ELEVATOR SHAFT - CONTINUOUS
The three still climbing handhold by handhold knocking loose

dirt in each others eyes Bill is just now reaching the
first floor level trying to force open the outer doors
Suddenly an ominous sound the chainmechanism of the
elevator as they see it starting to descend towards them
Panicking Bill tries with all his might

As the elevator inches closer and closer --

Until Bill finally manages to get the doors open They all
scramble to safety just as the elevator slides by them

NEW ANGLE

After they catch their breath they look up and around to
find themselves --

INT THE NECROPOLIS - CONTINUOUS

A distorted MC Escher-like feel to the place Where up
seems to be down down up and left is right Not helped by
behind only lit by the eerie flickering gaseous lamps
outside and the moonlight falling through the skylight

Then slowly through the gloom they begin to perceive that
the walls are clotted and congealed teratomic masses of
distorted flesh faces limbs eyes mouths all trapped -
all contorted in agony At first they seem to be frozen in
the walls like the ruins of Herculaneum But then we see --

They are slowly writhing moving Hands grasping teeth and
rotted jaws widening and worst of all the eyes staring out

PATRICK
Is this Hell

BILL
(gripping the gun)
Or just Hell-adjacent

CINNABAR
Aint no Heaven Aint no Hell Theres
just the world of the dead my momma
always talked about Like she said the
door is open and were seeing right
through our world into this one We just
have to remember what was really here
And follow it Those stairs should take
us to the second floor

As they approach the stairs they can hear faintly above the
dronemoan of the dead the soft music playing in Bones
crib

ANGLE AS

They start up the stairs into the darkness Patrick first
Cinnabar in between him and Bill Patrick still holding his
flashlight but its starting to flicker a little
More of the same horror along the stairway walls eyes
looking at them hands caress Cinnabars hair another hand
shooting up from the stair floor and grabbing Bills thigh
Bill stabs the hand with the knife on his belt And the
hands shoot back down

BACK IN BONES CRIB

The Munch-like dance of death goes on Bones stroking the
back of her neck

BONES
Just like I told you this morning Id be
stroking your neck tonight

Pearl absolutely lost
BACK ON THE STAIRS

The three still ascending when Patricks flashlight suddenly
cuts out Total darkness

PATRICK
Shit

A faint sound Patrick shaking the flashlight Nothing but
the sound of breathing both human and non-human

PATRICK (CONTD)
Thing worked fine a minute ago
Batteries were brand new --

Then as suddenly as it went out the flashlight comes back
on illuminating a horrible sight Maurice Standing right
there a few feet in front of them

BILL
Maurice

Maurice puts a finger to his lips and beckons them to follow
The boys want it to be Maurice But Cinnabar knows better

CINNABAR
Thats not Maurice --

But with the beam of the flickering flashlight they follow
the shadowy figure up the steps

Then Maurice gets a bit to far ahead and they cant see him
for a beat

PATRICK
Maurice Hold up man

Then after a silent beat just Maurices hand appears back
out of the darkness beckoning them onward Then the
flashlight cuts out again Theyre back in the darkness
PATRICK (CONTD)
(as he shakes the flashlight)
Okay were on the second floor I feel
it No more steps

The sound of Patrick cursing and shaking the batteries around
in the torch Eventually it comes on again

Up ahead they still barely see Maurice his back to them
face in one quarter profile leading them towards the next
flight of stairs at the end of the hall

They follow Closer and closer to the stairs Maurice going
eerily in and out of their vision The flashlight dies
again

Darkness Patrick shakes it and it comes back quickly Then
just as quickly dies again A shake and its lit again --
just as Bill is stepping into the corner where Maurice
disappeared

FLICKERING HORROR

As the dog leaps at them from the corner all teeth and
slavering jaws Everyone scrambles for their lives and the
flashlight falls to the floor

LOW ANGLE FROM THE FLOOR - JUST BEHIND THE FLASHLIGHT

We see the skewed horror as the dog tears at Bill as his
gun skitters across the floor as Patrick grabs the gun and
fires and we get a bit more illumination from the exploding
gunpowder But it does no good

Bill screams in terror as hes torn to pieces and then the
flashlight goes out and again were in Stygian darkness
The sound of Bill dying and a long silence

PATRICK (CONTD)
Bill Cinnabar Cinnabar

No answer At first Finally in husky voice

CINNABAR
Im here

PATRICK
Bill Bill

CINNABAR
Patrick hes

PATRICK
Okay okay Listen

From somewhere comes the sound of the music from Bones crib
PATRICK (CONTD)
Here find my hand The stairs are right
near here I saw them Lets just walk
up there

CINNABAR
I cant find you

PATRICK
Here

Silence As we expect the worse expect something else to
take her hand But then

CINNABAR
Is that you

Pause -- the music from Bones crib still beckons to them

PATRICK
Yeah Come on Dont let go

Were in near total darkness as they climb the stairs maybe
a bit of moonlight now coming in from the roofless third
floor theyre approaching All we can hear is their
footsteps and their breathing as they walk the rest of the
way up the stairs and emerge into

BONES CRIB - THEIR POV

Both amazed to see Pearl as young and beautiful as Cinnabar
is clinging to the dashing Jimmy dancing to the spectral
sounds of some soul classic from back in the day Cinnabar
entranced by the vision

ANGLE AS

Pearl opens her dreaming eyes and sees them smiling and
beckoning Cinnabar to come join her Cinnabar begins to

Patrick watches her until he hears something OS calling to
him It sounds a million miles away and yet right in his
ear And it sounds like Jeremiah

JEREMIAH
Paaatrick

This portion of the screenplay contains scenes that do not
appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie In order to maintain the
integrity of the screenplay it has not been edited

PATRICKS POV

He turns and looks at the wall -- subtly surging from beneath
the surface of the wall he sees flashes of faces and hands
mouths twisted in torment He moves to the wall drawn by
the strange sight and the recurring sound

JEREMIAH (CONTD)
(as if a million miles away)
Patrick Help me

Its coming from within the wall
INTERCUTTING

Now while Cinnabar is advancing towards her mother and
father across the room --

Patrick at the wall tries to place his ear near it in order
to hear where the voice is coming from

While Cinnabar is now within Bones reach Pearl steps back
to allow Jimmy to embrace Cinnabar Theyre reunited

BONES
Welcome home baby girl

Pearl watches as Bones caresses his daughters cheek
Patrick now close to the wall -- trying to hear the faint
voice calling to him

JEREMIAH
Pleasehelp me

PATRICK
Dad

Suddenly something enormous presses out from the wall
Patrick stumbles back as his fathers head and torso press
out from the wall stretched in straining effort

JEREMIAH
Help me Im so sorry But please help
me

PATRICK
Daddy

Jeremiah or what hes become embedded into the wall his
face stretched mouth huge and hollow eyes dripping bloody
tears

JEREMIAH
Please Help me Im scared

Patrick in anguish
JEREMIAH (CONTD)
It hurts I dont want to spend forever

like this

Jeremiahs arm reaches out from the wall grasping towards
Patrick who reaches out to his father --

When suddenly with frightening speed Jeremiah grabs it and
wrenches Patrick to him pulling Patrick flush up against the
wall even starting to suck him in to the wall

PATRICK
No

As Patrick struggles and writhes and twists to get free from
his fathers grasp he can see back across the room to the
others He sees the room as it really is - he can see whats
really happening

Pearl not in a new dress but in a horrible tattered blood
encrusted old dress standing next to a rotting cadaver
thats stroking Cinnabars cheek and holding her close

Jeremiah pulling Patrick into the wall into the Necropolis
itself Patrick though just as concerned with Cinnabar as
with himself yelling at her across the crib

PATRICK (CONTD)
Cinnabar Stop

But Cinnabar doesnt even turn her head She just steps into
her fathers embrace But Pearl does seem to hear something

She looks back at Patrick beneath the illusion of the room
she sees him being pulled into the awful wall and can hear
him more clearly now

PATRICK (CONTD)
No Cinnabar no

Slowly Pearl turns and looks into the mirror and she gets a
full-length view of herself a woman in ruined tatters of her
old rotted dress

Then coming into her view in the mirror is her only daughter
-- dancing with a decayed corpse

PEARL
Noooooo

Pearl whirls and rips Cinnabar away from Bones who at first
sort of chuckles to himself But he stops laughing when
Pearl grabs the nearest candle and presses the flame to her
breast In a terrible whoosh the dried old dress and Pearl
are engulfed in flames

BONES

Bones runs to Pearl and throws his arms around her trying to
smother the flames any way he can
PEARL
(to Patrick and Cinnabar)
Get out Gol

Cinnabar in a shattered daze on the floor sees her mother in
flames

Patrick desperately tries to escape his fathers death grip
Finally with horrible sound Patrick wrestles free from the
wall and from his father

He lurches free from them and makes it over to Cinnabar and
drags her out the door just as the room dissolves around
them As the flames destroy the dress and the last vestiges
of Bones blood on it the room begins to turn to ash

An eerie wind from nowhere begins to howl blowing the ash
and smoke from the dress and from the dissolving walls

Cinnabar taking one last glance at the funeral pyre that was
her mother and Bones now too sees them almost lost in a
shroud of flame and ash

ANGLE AS

Patrick and Cinnabar run down the corridor and back down the
stairs the moon overhead and the flames from Bones crib
giving everything a flickering hellish cat

Everything behind and above them crumbling to dust The
floor and then the stairs and all the howling bodies trapped
inside

ON THE FIRST FLOOR

They reach the open elevator shaft

PATRICK
We gotta jump

CINNABAR
I cant

Everything around them rumbling and crumbling

PATRICK
We have to

Patrick jumps and lands in the muddy ashes dazed but unhurt
LOOKING UP

He sees Cinnabar peering over the edge in fear Then behind
her he can hear a low rumbling growl He sees Cinnabar turn

and scream --

Ashes and falling debris then temporarily blind hen he wipes
his eyes and looks up Cinnabar is gone from view

PATRICK (CONTD)
Cinnabar Where are you

He immediately climbs back up the shaft when he sees Cinnabar
standing at the edge of the shaft above him

PATRICK (CONTD)
Cinn Jump

And she jumps landing right next to Patrick who quickly
gets her to her feet

PATRICK (CONTD)
Lets go

They run out of the shaft and into the sub-basement just as
the elevator and shaft dissolve into ash

A hurricane wind blowing down and out of the shaft now
Mixed with the sound of all the screaming moaning souls in

the Necropolis

Patrick in a fury to live tears away the boards and debris
blocking the exit

He pulls Cinnabar out with him and they walk up the cellar
stairs step into the dawn weary beaten down but not dead

EXT BONES BUILDING - DAY
Theyve made it out of the Inferno Like Dante said Thus we
emerged again to see the stars No stars here just the

glorious dawn

Patrick stops feels the new sun on his face Breathes clean
air again for the first time

PATRICK
We made it

Then from behind or above or somewhere we can hear what might
be a low low chuckle Jimmy Bones chuckle

BONES (0S)
Dog eat dog boy Dog eat dog

Patrick turns and spins in mounting horror There behind
him right where Cinnabar was standing

The black dog It leaps right at the camera filling the
frame with huge teeth and bloody red tongue WE FREEZE

FADE TO BLACK
