A line of PASSENGERS about to board a Pan Am flight to
London

JACK CAMPBELL 22 head full of long unkempt hair Tom
Selleck mustache the hopeful look of youth in his
eyes sitting next to

KATE REYNOLDS 21 pretty Dorothy Hamill haircut
rubbing the tears from her swollen red eyes

KATE
I got you a few necessities

Kate hands Jack a new copy of Vonnegut’s “Cat’s
Cradle”

KATE (CONT’D)
Your copy was a mess

Jack accepts the book but he’s unable to take his eyes
off Kate She hands him a cassette

KATE (CONT’D)
Every one of these songs will
remind you of me in a slightly
different way

JACK
All in one tape

KATE
I also put side two of London
Calling on there

Kate leans over and kisses him passionately on the
lips

KATE (CONT’D)
That was not officially the
goodbye kiss It was just an
interim kiss

He looks at her his eyes welling up He pulls her
close kissing her deeply Then

ANNOUNCER (0S)
This will be the final boarding
call for Pan Am flight 4 to
London Heathrow

Jack takes Kate’s hand getting up turning sadly to
the gate

KATE
You have your ticket

Jack pulls out a BLUE PAN AM TICKET ENVELOPE Kate
nods They embrace and kiss again As they separate

JACK
I’m not even gonna say it
Kate Maybe it’1l be like
I never left

Jack takes one lastlook at her then heads for the
gate

Kate stands there watching him go Then

-a moment of intuition Something isn’t right She
looks at Jack about to disappear into the jetway
trying to decide

KATE
Wait

Jack turns Kate approaches him

KATE (CONT’D)
I have a bad feeling about
this

JACK
About the plane What do you
think it’s gonna crash Don’t
say that

KATE
(shaking her head)
I know we’ve talked about this a
thousand times and we both agree
that going to London is the
right thing to do But in my
heart this feels wrong

She looks at the gatethe last few passengers are
boarding
then back into Jack’s eyes
KATE (CONT’D)
Don’t go Jack

JACK
You mean don’t go at all
What about my internship

KATE
Believe me I know what an
incredible opportunity this
is for you

JACK
For us Kate

KATE
Right for us ButI’m
afraid that if you get on
that plane

JACK
What

Kate looks at him pleading with her eyes but she can’t
say

KATE
(torn)
Go I’m sorry you should just
go
JACK

(thinking then)
No you’re right What are we
doing

KATE
Were being responsible Go
Get on the plane

His eyes narrow as he measures her determination

KATE (CONTD)
(a smile)
Get the hell outta my sight
You bother me

A laugh from Jack Kate gives him a calm smile anda
nod - its not entirely convincing but its enough for
Jack
JACK
(resolute)
Okay Im going

He takes her in his arms one last time and hugs her
tight Jack looks toward the gate the line
disappearingKate grasps his shirt tightly

KATE
I cant seem to let go of
you

JACK
You hear me complaining about
that

A sober look in Jacks eyes

JACK (CONTD)
Look were at the airport and
no one ever thinks clearly at
the airport so we should just
trust the decision we already
made Youve been accepted to
one of the best law schools in
the country Ive got this
internship at Barclays Bank
We have a great plan honey

Kate nods then with resolve

KATE
You want to do something
great Jack Lets flush the
planstart our lives right
now todayI dont know what
that lifes gonna look like
but I do know it has both of
us in it And I choose us

Jack is jolted by her words

KATE (CONTD)
The plan doesnt make us
great Jack What we have
together thats what makes us
great

Her words sink inA long moment of decisionHe
looks toward the gate only one person left in
lineback to Kateimploring him with her eyes
FinallyHe kisses her deeply on the lips

JACK

»a smile from Katereliefthen

JACK (CONTD)
(taking her face in
his hands)

CHAPTER FOUR - A DIFFERENT LIFE
DISSOLVE TO

24 INT CAMPBELL HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

Close in on Jack’s face bathed in morning lighthe
opens his eyesfeels something strange

Jack looks downthere’s a woman’s head resting on his
chest

A look of confusion crosses his facetrying to
remember did he meet a woman last night

He turns his head to find a large MUTT sitting
faithfully beside the bed wagging his tail

did she have a dog

He looks down at the woman again craning his neck to
get a look at her face And then he sees her

KATE REYNOLDS

now 34 and even more beautiful a look of utter
contentment on her radiant face sleeping soundly
His head darts around the room - it’s cramped and lived
in clothes and toys are strewn about family photos on
the dresser Laura Ashley curtains a tiny poster bed
and a charming little bay window

He instinctively reaches for his Franck Mueller watch
on the night stand but it’s not there It’s a Timex

Indiglo and it reads “757 AM”

Jack looks back at Katehe rubs his eyesmaybe it’s

a dreambut nothing changes Then Kate stirs
KATE
Mmmmten more minutes
Jack it’s Christmas

Jack jumps as he hears Kate talk for the first time

Suddenly the door bursts openA SIX YEAR OLD GIRL
ANNIE in a little nightgown walks into the room
carrying an 18 MONTH OLD BOY JOSH SINGING at the top
of her lungs

ANNIE
Jingle bells Santa s
mells Rudolph laid an
eggla la la la-la la
la la la la la la

Annie places Josh on the bed and then jumps up
herself She gestures to the dog patting the bed

ANNIE (CONT’D)
You too Luce

The dog faithfully jumps on the tiny bed joining
everybody else and leaving very little room Annie
starts jumping

ANNIE (CONT’D)
Riseandshine

KATE
(stirring)
You’ re jumping
sweetheart

Jack looks at this activity like a man at his own
funeral

ANNIE
Mom don’t you think we
need to open the
presents

KATE

(groggy)
Mommy needs five more
minutes in la la land
That could be her
present

Josh crawls directly up to Jack’s stomach climbing
on

ANNIE
C’mon Dad Get up

She said “Dad”

That’s it Jack moves the baby gingerly over then
gets out of bed stumbling over a baseball bat lying
next to it

He picks up the batthe same Willie Mays autograph
bat that was encased in glass in his NY apartment

Frightened Jack drops the bad looking down at himself
for the first timehe’s naked

a mortified look on his face as he sees the kids on
the bed

he quickly grabs a pair of sweat pants anda yellow
cardigan off the chair and throws them on

Kate still half asleep reaches out her hand

KATE
Jack

Jack turns by instinct Kate grabs him drawing him
near A look of fear on his face as Kate opens her
eyes

Eye contactJack’s certain he’s about to hear her
scream

KATE (CONT’D)
(still groggy)
Strong coffee okay

She lets him go as Jack backs out the door
25 INT CAMPBELL HOUSE LIVING ROOM - SECONDS LATER

A garishly decorated Christmas tree sits in the middle
of this messy and disorganized living room a bevy of
gifts underneath and four red stockings over the
fireplace

Jack darts to the top of the steps

KATE (0S)
(calling from
the bedroom)
Use an entire can if you
have to

He looks back at the bedroom then at the
stairsquickly heading down the CREAKY steps still
in shock

He grabs an overcoat from a hook by the front
doorabout to step out when he looks down and
realizes

-he’s barefoot He glances at a pair of rubber over-
boots sitting by the door slips them on just about to

leave when

He hears the sound of a KEY TURNING in the door

lockJack looks at the door not quite sure what to
do
The door opensinto the house arms laden with

wrapped gifts walk BIG ED and LORRAINE REYNOLDS (both
60s) Kate’s parents Big Ed’s wearing a ten gallon
hat and a suede overcoat Lorraine has a cigarette
dangling from her mouth

JACK
(drawing on a
memory)
Ed Lorraine

Big Ed hugs Jack as best he can with an armful of
gifts

Jeannie I found Jack
36 INT BENDER HOUSE DEN - A LITTLE LATER

Jack follows Arnie into the den of this garishly
decorated suburban home Arnie’s arm around his
shoulder

ARNIE
You look terrible

Jack takes in the decor - it’s a male leisure time
fantasy - old pinball machine wide screen TV dart
board and kitschy ‘50s style bamboo bar

ARNIE (CONT’D)
Truth is I expected you
Kate called before and
asked if I knew where you
were

Arnie notices Jack’s fascination with the room

ARNIE (CONT’D)
I know I moved the
Barca-lounger into the
corner It’s throwin’
everybody off What do
you think

JACK
(with a nod)
Great room

A satisfied smile from Arnie Jack’s approval means
something to him

ARNIE
You and me buddy We
know how to live

Arnie shepherds Jack onto a bar stool and pours a drink
out of a bamboo bottle holder

ARNIE (CONT’D)
So Jack you okay

Jack doesn’t respond his eyes drawn to a softball team
photo on the barJack and Arnie kissing a huge trophy
with the caption “Plainfield NJ Softball League
Champs 1994”
ARNIE (CONT’D)
I mean you leave the
house on Christmas

Jack looks over from the photo to Arnie

JACK
We’re friends aren’t we

ARNIE
Maybe I don’t say it
enough but you moving in

Arnie makes a fist and gestures to his heart Jack
nods

ARNIE (CONT’D)
Talk to me

A moment of decision for Jack as Arnie stands there
open eyed ready to listen

JACK
I’m having kind of a bad
day
ARNIE
(nodding)

I read somewhere that the
suicide rate doubles
during the holidays

A raised eyebrow from Jack

ARNIE (CONT’D)

(to himself)
What am I saying You
don’t need to hear
that

(back to Jack)
All I meant was a lot of
people have a hard time
dealing with all the
forced reverie that’s
all Is that you

JACK
Is it
ARNIE
Trouble at work

JACK
I don’t think so

ARNIE
It’s not Kate is it

Jack pauses at the mention of Kate Arnie’s eyes
widen

ARNIE (CONT’D)

(proudly)
You see it’s like we’re
in each other’s heads

JACK
Kate’s my wife

Jack looks at Arnie as if he’s seeking confirmation

ARNIE
(a playful smile)
Just keep saying it
Jack like a mantra

Arnie comes out from behind the bar taking Jack by the
arm

ARNIE (CONT’D)
C’mon I better walk ya

as it is right

37 EXT ARNIE’S YARD - SECONDS LATER

ARNIE
Look you fit the profile

about Where’s the
romance where’s the joie
de vivre Suddenly

Newark Star Ledger
represents a life you
can’t have

JACK
(thinking then)
It’s just two kids
right

A chuckle from Arnie

ARNIE
You made a choice Jack
a promise to your wife
Maybe sometimes it seems
like you gave up the
world but look what you
got

They arrive atthe backyard of the Campbell house
cluttered with a swing set a dog run with chewed up
lawn and a wooden sun deck in the process of being
built

ARNIE (CONT’D)
Four bedrooms two and a
half baths anda
partially finished
basement

Jack trips over a wayward BIG WHEEL

ARNIE (CONT’D)
(shaking his head)

Arnie leads Jack toward the house

ARNIE (CONT’D)
Okay look you probably

what you told me last
summer when I almost had
that thing with Arnie
Jrs speech therapist

A blank stare from Jack as they arrive at the sliding
glass doorArnie faces Jack squarely grabbing his
shoulders and looking him in the eye

ARNIE (CONT’D)
Don’t screw up the best
thing in your life just
because you’re a little
unsure about who you
are Okay

Arnie gives Jack a comforting smie
ARNIE (CONT’D)
God it feels so good to

finally give something
back to you

Arnie turns Jack toward the door and slides it open

ARNIE (CONT’D)
I’m gonna hug you now

Arnie gives Jack a gentle hugthen gives him a little
push toward the door

38 INT CAMPBELL HOUSE DEN - CONTINUOUS

Jack steps inside He turns back to the door but
Arnie’s gone

JACK
You cut your hair

A curious look from Kate

KATE
Ten years ago

Kate just stands there looking at Jack giving away
nothing

KATE (CONT’D)
Are you okay

JACK
Yeahfine

She gives him a resolute nod then
KATE
(into phone)
Never mind he just

Jack grimaces as she resolutely hangs up the phone then
stares him down angrily

KATE (CONT’D)

morning don’t tell me

hours later I had state
troopers looking for
you I called
hospitals

(pointing at

the phone)
Il was just on the
phone with the morgue
for god’s sake

Jack watches her vent the frustration on his face
building

KATE (CONT’D)
What kind of man leaves
his family on Christmas
morning without a word
about where he’s going

Jack’s almost to a breaking po INT

KATE (CONT’D)
What kind of man does
that

JACK
(jumping in)
I don’t know Please

She looks at him curiously

KATE
Where were you

KATE

A raised eyebrow from Kate Jack moves around the
room

JACK (CONT’D)
(pointing upstairs)
I’m not “Dad” Kate

Kate looks him over assessing then

KATE
You know what Jack
It’s not funny this

She stares him down expecting an answer But he has
no answer

KATE (CONT’D)
(loudly)
Jack

Jack takes the bell out of the plastic bag that Cash
gave him holds it up in front of her and starts
RINGING it furiously

ThenAnnie rides into the room on her new bike

ANNIE

Annie rides excitedly out of the room on her bike
Leaving Jack and Kate alone again

KATE
You missed the whole

Jack sees the disappointment on her face

KATE (CONT’D)
You missed Christmas

Jack looks down almost ashamedhe relents giving in
to the moment

JACK

winter air The dog sniffs at a hydrant and a couple
of garbage cans but isn’t doing her business

JACK
Figure it outI’ms
creweddon’t have to
be a genius to figure
that out

The dog stops sniffing at a manicured lawn

JACK (CONT’D)
(to Lucy)
It’s as good a place as
any

But the dog keeps moving pulling Jack with her

JACK (CONT’D)
but obviously not up
to your high standards

(to himself)

Okayhe said you’re
working on a new deal
nowfine you’ve done a
thousand deals what’s
the first thing you do

Lucy’s sniffing around someone’s Christmas display but
Jack’s too wrapped up in his thought process to notice

JACK (CONT’D)
Triage It’s your
signature You survey
the damage find out
everything you can you
probe leave nothing to
chance I’m just gonna
have to go detective
How did you get
Mentadent You learned
everything there was to
know about toothpaste and
then you pounced

Jack narrows his eyes thinking about that deal

JACK (CONT’D)
That’s our play here

Resolute Jack turns to the dog

JACK (CONT’D)
If you could take a dump
some time in this
century then we could go
home where it’s warm

Jack looks around at the unfamiliar houses

JACK (CONT’D)
That is if I can even
remember how to get
home
(to Lucy)
You remember don’t you
girl

But the dog ignores him dragging Jack along
47 INT CAMPBELL HOUSE BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT
Kate is in bed fast asleep

Jack walks into the room his face still red from the
cold outside He looks over at Kate sleeping happily

He takes off his shirt and khakis laying them neatly
on the chair He looks over at the pair of flannel
pajamas folded on the dresser He shakes his head
resigned then dons the pajamas and climbs into bed

CHAPTER SIX - BEING A PARENT

Morning light streams into the room The clock reads
“714”

Jack opens his eyes - a burst of light hitting them
from the windowlike the morning light in his
Manhattan loft
He reaches across the bedit’s empty

A smile of hope from Jack as he puts his head back on
the pillowmaybe it was only a dayThen

The sound of a baby CRYING from the next roomA
pained look on Jack’s face as he realizes he’s still in
Jersey

Now the baby is WAILINGJack lies still a moment
hoping it’ll stopit doesn’t Then he hears the
sound of the SHOWER TURN ON in the bathroom

He gets out of bed and walks to the bathroom

naked body

KATE (CONT’D)

CUT TO
50 INT JOSH’S ROOM - MORNING

Annie’s watching from a baby-size Laz-E-Boy lounger
as

Jack in a robe stands in front of a changing table
Josh laying happily on his back playing with a set of
plastic keys

Jack takes a fresh Huggies diaper and puts it next to
the baby He surveys Josh scratching his chin and
rubbing his hands like Indiana Jones Josh playfully
grabs at Jack’s nose

He looks over to Annie She’s still staring at him
like he’s a Martian He looks at the instructions on
the box of Huggies

JACK
Pull tape

Jack searches the diaper for the tabs of tape then
gingerly pulls them apart releasing the diaper from
the baby’s bottom and seeing what’s inside

JACK (CONT’D)
Holy mother of god

Jack holds the diaper out away from him searching for
a place to put it Annie points to a Diaper Genie by
the dresser

Jack throws the diaper in then quickly replaces the
lid Annie points to the container of Baby Wipes
JACK (CONT’D)
You must be kidding

Annie stares at him a beat Then

ANNIE
You’ re not really our
dad are you

Jack turns to her She’s looking back at him with
complete earnestness They stare at each other another
moment Then

JACK
No I’m not

A look of curiosity from Annie

JACK (CONT’D)
I work on Wall Street

buildings

No response from Annie

JACK (CONT’D)
I live in an apartment
house with a doorman I

anything I want

Annie nods at Jack still suspicious

JACK (CONT’D)
This isn’t my real life
It’s just a glimpse

ANNIE
Where’s my real dad

JACK
I don’t know

A concerned look on Annie’s face Jack’s petrified that
she’s about to cry

JACK (CONT’D)
But don’t worry he loves

(to himself)

She thinks about it for a moment

ANNIE

55 EXT BIG ED’S TIRES - MOMENTS LATER

Jack approaches Big Ed’s from the parking lotslowly
taking it all in

It’s like a Pep Boys with a Texas theme A big retail
store for tires and auto parts and a repair bay for
everything from alignments to brake jobs

Jack walks to the tire bay where HECTOR 40s a
Guatemalan mechanic in grease-stained coveralls stands
with TOMMY the salesman

TOMMY

JACK
Thank you

Jack walks into the office with his name on the door
57 INT JACK’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

There’s no Stairmaster here no leather sofa or
barit’s small cramped and cluttered the walls
littered with tire inventory and price lists

Jack takes a slow sad lap around the office

He makes it to the small wooden desk at the far end of
the room and sits down behind it

On the desk are photos of Jack Kate and the kids a
plastic Michelin Man model a tire-themed day calendar
and a small plastic figurine of a BOWLER the word
“Bowlers Do It In An Alley” embossed on its base

He surveys the desktop briefly then opens the top
drawer finding a personal checkbook and looking
inside

He sees the bottom line and winces then puts it
back

Jack picks up the “Bowlers Do It In An Alley” figurine
and gives it a good look

JACK
Bowlers do it in an
alleyNon profit
lawyers do it for free
what is it with these
people Don’t they
realize this refers to
sex

He replaces the figurine then opens the bottom drawer
where he spots a bottle of Glenfiddich He lifts it
out

JACK (CONT’D)
At least you splurged on
some decent scotch

He takes a paper cup and pours himself a shot He
drinks it down in one gulp and then crumples up the
cup throwing it toward the NET’S basketball
hoopgarbage can near the door

He misses

He looks more closely at the photographsmost are
family photos a happy Jack with Kate with Annie at
the pony rides at Josh’s birthin every one of them
Jack is smiling

JACK (CONT’D)
(to Jack in
the photo)
What are you smiling

He turns his headspots a small plaque on the wall
behind him It reads “Jack Campbell - EF Hutton 1

eyebrow

JACK (CONT’D)

He grabs it off the wall and looks at it more
carefully

JACK (CONT’D)

Jack’s jarred into reality

JACK (CONT’D)

I have no idea what

you
A KNOCK at the door

JACK (CONT’D)
Look just send us what
you sent us last month
okay And keep doing
that until further
notice

He hangs up the phone as the door opens Big Ed sticks
his head in

Big Ed walks in followed by SYDNEY POTTER 60s a
tough looking man

BIG ED
Jack meet Sydney Potter
BuyRite Transport one of
Jersey’s top
businessmen

Potter extends a hand Jack rises from his chair
trying to place the name Then

JACK
and a helluva bridge
player Ed’s told me a
lot about you

They shake hands Potter nods his head at Jack
immediately impressed Big Ed is beaming

POTTER
(in a heavy Jersey
accent)
Lucky in cards lucky in
business lucky in love
My cup runneth over

(to Big Ed)
He’s a nice looking
boy

BIG ED

My daughter’s no slouch
either
A smile from Potter then a serious look

POTTER
Let’s cut to the chase
Jack Big Ed tells me
you’ re the grease that
makes the wheels turn
around here I need a
new parts supplier for my
fleet You seem to have
the parts That we
know What we don’t know
is why the hell I should
buy them from you

Potter stares Jack down But Jack’s not about to be
intimidated by him He pauses matching Potter’s
stare Then

JACK
I have no idea

A surprised look from Potter An anxious laugh from
Big Ed

BIG ED
(nervous)
C’mon Jack

JACK

(to Potter)
I mean it From what I
can tell we’re a mom and
pop operation we’re
already over-extended in
sales and any price
advantage we could offer
would easily be matched
by a larger supplier

Jack continues to stare down Potter

JACK (CONT’D)
So like I said I don’t
have any idea why you
should buy your parts
from us

The staring match continues Big Ed’s getting more
nervous Potter’s the first to blink
POTTER
Okay you got my

attention

JACK
Except for rule number
one

Jack smiles

JACK (CONT’D)
The customer is always
right A cliché Sure
The difference is we
mean it We’re small we
need our customers We
can’t afford to
disappoint them ever
Yeah you could go to
some leviathan supplier
probably save a few
pennies on the price of
oil filters but with us
you get more than a
supplier you get a
bridge partner

A smile from Potter Jack gives Ed a wink Ed
watches thrilled

JACK (CONT’D)
You want to bid hearts
we’re right there with
you You feel the need
to redouble you’re not
going to get any argument
from us

Potter nods at Jack Jack moves in for the kill

JACK (CONT’D)
The big guys may have the
high cards but you know
as well as I do Sydney
high cards don’t always
take the trick

Potter pauses a minute then

POTTER
(to Big Ed
re Jack)
I like him
Big Ed smiles letting out a relieved sigh

BIG ED
(a wink to Jack)
That’s my boy
(an arm around Potter)
C’mon lemme show you the
rest of the ranch

Big Ed and Potter exit the office

BIG ED (CONT’D)
(turning back to Jack)

KATE

KATE (CONT’D)
The trek out to the

JACK

Jack stands at a lane holding a bowling ball the
nickname “The Hammer” emblazoned over his bowling shirt
pocketHe approaches the line and throws the ball
down the lane

It’s uglyThe ball caroms off the hardwood into the
gutter

JACK
Damn

ARNIE
(OS from behind)
Jesus Jack this is a

You can still pick up the
spare

Jack retrieves his ball sets up genuinely

concentrating

rapids at Kenai You ran
with the bulls at
Pamplona You jumped out
of a plane over the
Mojave Desert for
Christ’s sake You can
do this

Jack puts everything he has into the throw heaving the
ball down the lane with as much grace and power as he
can musterhitting the six pin and taking out four
others

JACK (CONT’D)

He turns a fist pumpedBut the guys could care
less

ARNIE
(to TEAMMATE)

Jack walks out of the men’s room heading toward the
lounge He sees a familiar face walking toward hima
woman in a sexy little bowling outfit carrying a
bowling ball to a far lane

EVELYN
Hi Jack

A moment of confusion as he tries to place the face
Then

JACK
Evelyn right

EVELYN
Very funny I saw you

JACK
Something like that

EVELYN
(with a wink)

She brushes past Jack continuing to her laneJack
follows her with his eyes a moment then

JACK
Wait a second

She turns

JACK (CONT’D)
Are we

EVELYN
Are we what Jack

JACK
Is there something going
on between us

Evelyn’s surprised at Jack’s directness She stands
there a beat then walks back toward him

EVELYN
Are we finally being
honest

JACK

It would help me if we
were
EVELYN
Okay you’re right we’ve
been dancing around this
for years

Evelyn looks a little flushshe briefly fans her
face

EVELYN (CONT’D)

God my heart is racing

(a smile)
When I get dressed for a
party and I know you’re
going to be there
well let’s just say I
don’t go strapless
because my husband likes
it

An intrigued smile from Jack

EVELYN (CONT’D)
I’ve got six sets of snow
tires piled up in my
garage and I won’t even
drive in the snowAnd
our kids just happen to
be in the same ballet

She picks a piece of lint off his shirt
EVELYN (CONT’D)
So if you’re asking me
whether I’d like it to be

A look of surprise from Jack
EVELYN (CONT’D)

have to know

Jack considers this for a moment

JACK

JACK
It wouldn’t really be

(off Arnie’s
doubtful look)
It’s complicated

ARNIE

dumps the bag in the coat closet and walks into the
kitchen where

Kate is at the counter her back to him poring over
some legal documents

KATE
(not looking up)
How was the game honey

JACK

(opening the fridge)
Long boring and
generally pretty sad

it

(peering inside)

Kate turns around revealing a huge hunk of chocolate
cake on a plate in front of her a bite ready to go
into her mouth

KATE
(with a smile)

where he can’t reach it

face practically covered in cake smiling and
realizes

-he hasn’t laughed like this in thirteen years
Then

JACK

A sexy smile from Katethey start kissing
passionately right there on the stepsit’s heating

She gets up and heads up the steps disappearing into
the bedroomJack shakes his head frustrated Then
he feels something licking at his hand

He looks down and sees Lucy standing next to him
wagging her tail looking up at Jack with an “I’ve
gotta go” look on her face Jack heaves a sigh
then
JACK (CONT’D)

C’mon Lucy maybe one of

us can get a little

relief tonight
He leads the dog toward the front door

70 EXT SUBURBAN STREET - MINUTES LATER

Jack is walking Lucy He passes a house that looks
familiar to him Then he sees it

the name “THOMPSON” etched on the mailbox

It’s the Thompson house now sans the garish Christmas
decorations a drying Christmas tree tied up on the
curb ready to be picked up as garbage

Jack stops pulling the dog back looking up at the
house

He sees a light on in the upstairs bedroomthe faint
outline of a woman reading by the window

EVELYN THOMPSON

Jack looks around sees the street is empty then
nudges the dog leading her up the path to the house

He gets to the front doormoves his hand up to the
doorbellbut it’s a tentative movehe keeps it
there a moment perched at the buttonbut for some
reason he can’t bring himself to push it

He looks down the street toward his own house then to
the window upstairs Finally he turns

JACK
(pulling the leash)
C’mon girl let’s go
home

71 INT CAMPBELL HOUSE FOYER - MINUTES LATER

The front door opens and Jack walks in with Lucy ona
leash his face red from the cold outside

He gives the dog a pat on the rump then takes off his
coat hanging it and the leash on a hook by the door

He walks through the quiet house into the living room
rubbing his hands together to warm them up

CHAPTER ELEVEN —- HOME MOVIES

He goes over to a glass bar stand and pours himself a
scotch taking a sip letting the alcohol warm him

He strolls through the room looking at some of the
family photos framed and hanging on the wall focusing
on his own face in the pictures studying the
expressions

He moves to a pile of video tapes sitting on a shelf
marked with titles like “Trip to Yosemite ‘96 and
“Josh’s lst Birthday” He runs his fingers along the
tapes stopping at one marked “Jack Singing” His
eyes linger there a moment
He puts his drink down and pops the tape in the VCR
ON TV

It’s a party for Kate’s birthday thrown at the Kramers’
housesame crowd of people as the Christmas party
cheesy “Happy Birthday” decorations

The image jerks up and down surveying the crowd

Bill Kramer at the piano playing some light cocktail
music Kate talking with a group of friends

ARNIE (0S)
Jesus Bill this thing

Bill stops playing and looks up at Arnie

76 INT FRONT PORCH - MINUTES LATER

Jack emerges from the house steps out onto the porch
for some air

He shakes his head a mixture of frustration and self-
pity on his face

He notices Annie’s bike leaning against the side of the
porch and the bell that Cash gave him sitting on its
handle bar
He takes a step toward it and gives the bell a gentle
RING he looks around as if he’s expecting someone
to appear but there’s no one He RINGS the bell
again louder this time really trying to attract
someone’s attention

JACK
C’monc’mon

Nothing Finally he lifts the bike up in the air

Jack raises an eyebrow

JACK
Maybe there’s a jewelry
store back at the mall
I could get her a pair of
earrings or something

ANNIE
That’s good butyou did
forget the anniversary

JACK

Right That’s a major
oversight

(thinking aloud)
So if I’m KateI can’t
really afford the finer
things my husband’s
career is a crushing
disappointment to me
I’m trapped in suburbia

Then
JACK (CONT’D)
Did he ever take her to

Suddenly a look of confidence comes over Jack’s face
For the first time he seems like a man in control

reassuring Kate

JACK (CONT’D)
I never used to be like
this Kate I had it all
figured out No doubts
no regrets

KATE
And now

JACK
NowI don’t

He looks at her staring into her eyes almost
desperate for understanding

KATE
Me neither

A raised eyebrow from Jack
KATE (CONT’D)

I think it’s good to be a
little unsure about who

you are It’s very
human

JACK
But you always seem so
certain

KATE

C’mon Jack you think
there aren’t mornings
when I wake up and wonder
what the hell I’m doing
in New Jersey

JACK
That’s a big one for me
too

KATE
My office is a dump I
answer my own phoneand

you’ve seen my pay check

JACK
Your pay check is a
disgrace to pay checks

KATE
I mean yes I help people
that need it

JACK
I guesssome of them
are probably faking

KATE
(a laugh then)
God sometimes I think it
would be so nice not to
have to stretch ground
beef or maybe drive a car
with a CD player

He smiles right there with her

KATE (CONT’D)
Imagine having a life
where everything was
easywhere you asked
for things and people
just brought them to
you

JACK
It’s wonderful

Kate laughs nodding
A pause then

KATE
I think about it too
Jack I do I think
about the kind of person
I’d be if I hadn’t
married you

It’s as if she’s inside his head They stay like this
for a moment looking into each other

JACK
And

She stops a moment considering Then

KATE
And I realize I’ve just
erased the things in my
life I’m most sure

about You the kids

Jack nods

JACK
Good things

KATE
What are you sure about

Jack looks into Kate’s eyes

JACK
I’m sure that right now
there’s nowhere I’d
rather be than here with
you

Kate smiles at Jack a loving secure smile It’s been
a while

they would’ve approached
you with an offer and
I’d bet anything it
would’ve been thirty
billion not twenty

(a knowing smile)
Problem was Peter you
had a pussycat running

Jack savors the moment until

LASSITER (CONT’D)
So about my car

He’s jarred back to reality a little crestfallen

JACK
Sure We’re going to
have to special order

Campbellthe one I was
telling you about

Mintz a confident look on his face gets up from the

ALAN
Jack of course

They shake hands

JACK
(appropriately
deferential)
Mr Mintz

ALAN
Please call me Alan We
try to cultivate a casual
atmosphere around here

JACK
(re play pen)
I can see that Alan

A chuckle from Mintz

ALAN
You have kids Jack

JACK
(hesitating then)
Uhactually yes Two
good ones

Another laugh from Mintz

ALAN
That’s great
(gesturing to
the sofa)
Why don’t you have a seat

Jack nods sits down on the plush sofa Mintz and
Lassiter take the chairs

ALAN (CONT’D)
So Peter mentioned that
you were an avid CNBC
watcher but didn’t say
whether you had any
actual Wall Street
experience

Jack’s a little taken aback by the question not
realizing he was walking into an interview

He crosses his legs trying to get comfortable

JACK
I was a sales associate
at EF Hutton

ALAN
A broker Really And now
you’re in the tire

business
JACK
That’s right And auto
supply
ALAN
Uh huh The retail end I
understand
Jack nods
JACK

Uhwe actually get about
sixty percent of our
business from automotive
service

ALAN
Mind if I ask what kind of
sales you did last year
Ballpark

JACK
We did one point seven
million in total revenue
Jack pauses

He stops

ALAN
Uh huhone point seven

And what do you project for

this year

Any thoughts at all on
that

As Jack stares into their faces
of his handicap

ALAN
Jack

takes a moment
a confident smile

JACK
Well Alan I think we’re
gonna have a banner year
Sales are up almost
twenty percent in the
first quarter and we just
landed a major trucking
company account

ALAN
Really So you’re
projecting what
over two million

a tad

A gleam in Jack’s eye

JACK
That’s right And that
would make us number one
in our market
(getting up)
You mind if I stand

A raised eyebrow from Mintz

analyzing the situationthe patronizing
questions the smirk on Mintz’s face

ALAN (CONT’D)

he realizes the extent

(CONT’ D)

looking at Mintz and Lassiter

Mintz and Lassiter follow Jack with their eyes as he
crosses the room to the desk
water

pours himself a glass of
JACK (CONT’D)
Look I know our paltry
little two million in
sales is about what you
spend on office supplies
in a year And I know
some regional trucking
company account is
nothing compared to a
sixty billion dollar
merger

ALAN
I’m not trying to knock
the tire business Jack

JACK

(a confident chuckle)
It’s okay Alan I get it
I’m in your shoes I’m
thinking exactly the same
thingbut here’s the
thing Business is
business Wall Street
Main Street it’s all
just a bunch of people
getting up in the morning
trying to figure out how
the hell they’re gonna
send their kids to
college It’s just
people

Jack’s confidence is throwing Mintz off but Lassiter
appears intrigued

JACK (CONT’D)
And I know people

ALAN
I’m sure you do

LASSITER
(intervening)
Let’s let the man have
his say

Mintz covers his embarrassment with a smile
JACK

(to Mintz)
Take you for instance
ALAN
(defensive)
What about me

JACK
You drink about sixteen
Diet Cokes a day You’re
an excellent father but
you feel guilty about the
time you spend away from
home You drink bourbon
but you offer your
clients scotch

Jack looks around the office then back to Mintz

JACK (CONT’D)
And your wife decorated
this office

A laugh from Lassiter as Mintz sits there stewing
caught look on his face

LASSITER
He certainly has your
number Alan

JACK
(turning to Lassiter)
You’re a little tougher
Peter

A raised eyebrow from Lassiter but he’s game

JACK (CONT’D)
For one thing you like
expensive things

LASSITER
(smiling proudly)
That’s easy You’ve seen
my car

JACK

(a chuckle)
Okayyou smoke Hoyo de
Monterreys You’re a
scotch man single malt
not because it’s trendy
but because you’ve been
doing it for forty years
and you stay with what
works You have two great
loves in your life your
horses and this company
You wept openly the day
the Dow hit ten thousand

Lassiter’s impressed

JACK (CONT’D)
And you’re a man who
prides himself on finding
talent in unusual

places
LASSITER
Oh And how would you
know that
Jack smiles
JACK

Because I’m here

On Lassiternodding his head Mintz a plastered-on
smile

JACK (CONT’D)
‘m prepared to do
anything it takes to get
this job Start anywhere
you need me to start
‘ll park cars if I

eyes)
The biggest part of
judging character is
nowing yourself And I
now this I can do this
job Give me a chance
Peter I won’t let you
down

arly

into a deserted section of

Jack returns Mintz’s

huh
you go

through his wallet or

something

Jack’s a little taken aback

ALAN (CONT’D)
No matter That circus
act back there may have

dazzled Lassiter
momentarily but it

doesn’t do shit forme
Even if you get this job
which I highly doubt let
me warn you Lassiter
loses interest in his pet
projects very quickly
I’m in the big office

because I’ve proved

myself to him year after
year and nobody is going
to come in here and start
turning the old man’s
head Especially not some
tire salesman from New
Jersey So you watch
yourself and stay away
from Lassiter and maybe
just maybe I’1l keep you
on after he gets tired of
you Do we understand
each other

Jack stands there staring at Mintz silent
expressionless

ALAN (CONT’D)
Do we

Then a broad smile from Jack

JACK
God you really are
different aren’t you
(nodding)
I meanwowI am
impressed

Now it’s Mintz’s turn to look quizzical
JACK (CONT’D)

Good for you Why shouldn’t
you protect what’s yours

ALAN
I don’t think you’re hearing
me

JACK

Oh I’m hearing you Alan
That’s not the problem
The problem is that what
you think is yours is
really mine And I don’t
care how low on the totem
pole I start I will get
it back

(poking him in

the chest)
So do yourself a favor and
don’t get too attached to
that view because sometime
soon maybe very soon you
and your French country
antiques your chintz sofa
and your little play pen
are gonna be moving out of
that office

Jack smiles at Alan one more time then turns

JACK (CONT’D)
Oh and by the way you
try selling tires for a
living I promise you
youd starve

Jack heads down the corridor whistling a happy tune
leaving Mintz standing there bewildered

A double door opens and Jack leads Kate into this huge
duplex Kate looks around taking the place in

JACK
Welcome to Xanadu

The place is incrediblemarble floors architectural
lines high tech fixtures elegant modern furniture
it’s striking but not at all homey like the Jersey
house

JACK (CONT’D)
Pretty incredible isn’t
it

KATE
It’s like a museum

Jack nods

KATE (CONT’D)
(turning to Jack)
So what’s the big
surprise You didn’t
rent this place for
the weekend did you

JACK
Think bigger

KATE
For the week

Jack chuckles

JACK
This place is a perk
Kate

KATE
A perk for what

JACK
A company called PK
Lassiter and Associates
Investment House uses it
to attract new
executives

Kate’s confused

JACK (CONT’D)
You’re talking to their
new Vice President of
Mergers and Acquisitions

KATE
What are you talking
about Jack

JACK
I’m going into arbitrage
honey Turns out I have
a knack for it I’1l be
making two hundred grand
a year plus a hefty bonus
and that’s just to
start And we can live
in this apartment
practically rent free for
as long as we want

Jack measures her reaction It’s not good

JACK (CONT’D)
We can finally afford to
move back into the city
In style
Kate just looks at him in shock Then

KATE
Are you out of your mind

JACK
I don’t think so This
is going to be a better
life for all of us
honey We’1ll put Annie
and Josh in private

schools

KATE
Annie goes to a great
school

JACK

I’m talking about the
best schools in the
country here Kate

KATE
Jack what could you
possibly be thinking
What about my job

JACK
This is New York City
it’s like the needy
people capital of the
world Those Jersey
clients of yours aren’t a
tenth as pathetic as the
ones you could get
here

KATE
(cutting him off)

I can’t believe you want
to move back into the
city I thought the
reason we left was
because we didn’t want to
raise the kids here

JACK
No this is the center of
the universe If I were
living in Roman times I
would live in Rome where
else Today America is
the Roman Empire and New
York is Rome itself

Look I’m detecting a
kind of funky tension

Jack’s back on his heelsseeing his dream picked
apart

KATE
In traffic It’s over an
hour each way That’s
almost three hours a
day When are you going
to see the kids

He’s frustratedhe pauses a moment to gather
himself Then

JACK
Kate You’re not
understanding me I’m
talking about a great
life A perfect life
Everything we pictured
when we were young The
whole package You said
it yourself life has
thrown us surprises and
so we made sacrifices
But now I can finally get
us back on track

A sad chuckle from Kate

JACK (CONT’D)
I can do that I want to
do that For all of us
I need to do that as a
man
(imploring her)
Think about it No more
lousy restaurants no
more clipping coupons no
more shoveling snow

KATE
Then get a goddamn snow
blower

Jack’s taken aback by the intensity of her tone

KATE (CONT’D)
Don’t get a new career
without even telling me
Don’t take Annie out of a
school she loves Don’t
move us out of a house
we’ve become a family
in

Kate stands there wounded

KATE (CONT’D)
(quietly)
Don’t do that

JACK
Look you’re making this
into something it’s not
This isn’t a referendum
on our lives Kate It’s
a step forward
(appealing to her)
Don’t you see I’m
talking about us finally
having a life other
people envy

Silence Kate looks him in the eye - a deep piercing

bookshelf

KATE (CONT’D)
I think about you on that

your mindyou sitting
there imagining our life

bill from her pocket and slides it across the counter
to Cash

ten dollarshe hands the girl 935

KATE
Don’t do this Jack
But he continues

JACK
We have two kids Annie and
Josh
-Kate looks at him half-mortified half-
interested

JACK (CONT’D)
-Annie’s not much of a
violin player but she
tries really hard She’s a
little precocious but that’s
only because she says what’s
on her mind And when she
smiles

Jack shakes his head remembering fighting back the
tears

JACK (CONT’D)

And Joshhe has your eyes
He doesn’t say much but we
know he’s smart

(lost in the memory)
-he’s always got his eyes
open always watching us
sometimes you can look at
him and just know that he’s
learning something new
it’s like witnessing a
miracle

Kate’s expression has sifted from annoyance to
curiosity

JACK (CONT’D)
the house is a mess but
it’s ours
(chuckling)
well after a hundred
twenty two more payments

Jack begins walking slowly toward Katethe world of
the airport going on around him Jack not caring

JACK (CONT’D)
And youyou’re a non-
profit lawyer That’s right
completely non-profit But

you

Kate raises an eyebrow It’s something she’s thought
about
JACK (CONT’D)
And we’re in love After
thirteen years of marriage
we’re still unbelievably
in love

(with a chuckle)

You won’t even let me touch
you until I’ve said it

Jack gets closer and closerKate’s spellbound now
imagining the picture Jack’s painting

JACK (CONT’D)
I sing to younot all
the time but definitely on
special occasions

Jack walks into a piece of carry-on luggage sitting by a
row of passengers

JACK (CONT’D)

(off hand to passenger)
Excuse me

(to Kate)
We made a lot of sacrifices

surprises but we stayed
together

Jack’s nearly there

JACK (CONT’D)
You see you’re a better
person than I am

Not in this life and Kate knows it

JACK (CONT’D)
and it made me a better
person to be around you

Kate is perfectly still Jack’s words echoing in her
ears

JACK (CONT’D)
Maybe it was all a
dream Maybe I went to
bed one lonely night in
December and imagined it
all But I swear
nothing’s ever felt more
real to me

He’s right in front of her She can’t take her eyes
off him

JACK (CONT’D)
And if you get on that
plane right now it’1l
disappear forever

Silence Jack and Kate in their own little
worldairport business going on around them

JACK (CONT’D)
I know we can both go on
with our lives And we’d
both be fine But I’ve
seen what we can be like
togetherAnd I choose
us

Jack’s words resonate in her ears He gently touches a
hand to her arm

JACK (CONT’D)
