1 LONG SHOT - REVOLVING GLOBE

As the globe revolves it becomes animated -- Long lines
of people (in miniature) stream from all sections of
Europe --to converge upon one point on the tip of Africa
OVER THIS animated scene comes a voice of a Narrator

NARRATOR

Refugees -- streaming from all cor-
ners of Europe towards the freedom
of the New World -- all eyes turned
toward Lisbon the great embarkation
point -- But now everybody could get
to Lisbon directly -- so a Refugee
Trail sprang up --

At first only the turrets and rooftops are visible against
a torrid sky In the distance is a haze-enveloped sky
The CAMERA PANS DOWN the facades of the

Moorish buildings to a narrow twisting street crowded
with the polyglot life of a native quarter The intense
desert sun holds the scene in a torpid tranquility Act-
ivity is unhurried and sounds are muted Suddenly the
screech of and siren shatters the calm Veiled women run
screaming for shelter Street vendors beggars and urch-
ins melt into doorways A police car speeds into the SHOT
and pulls up before an old-fashioned Moorish hotel -
flop-house would be a better word for it

THE SQUARE (FROM THE ANGLE OF THE WAITING LINE)

The square is typically French in its landscaping and
architecture This is the center of the modern city of
Casablanca» The police car is just pulling up to the curb
in front of the Prefecture A policeman opens the grated
door at the back of the car and a nondescript assortment
of refugees begin to pour out

A middle-aged English couple are standing in front of
their table for a better view of the commotion in front

DARK EUROPEAN

To get out of Casablanca they say

one needs two dollars for an exit

visa and two hundred for the Pre-

fect Unless of course one is a
beautiful young girl The rich and

the beautiful sail to Lisbon The

poor are always with us ( )

ENGL1SHWOMAN
Dreadful

unhappy refugees the scum of
Europe has gravitated to Casablanca
Some of them have been waiting

self Take care Be on guard

by this sudden dis-
Play of concern)

politely)
Bon jour Madame Bon jour Msieur

He walks OUT of the SHOT The Englishman still a trifle
disconcerted by the Europeans action looks after him

handkerchief )
Friendly chap wasnt he

He opens his coat feels inside

ENGLISHMAN
Silly of me

ENGLISEWOMAN

Their upturned gaze follows the flight of the plane In
their faces is revealed one hope they all have in common --
and the plane is the symbol of that hope The CAMERA STOPS
at the last of the line far out on the Street just as Jan
and Annina appear and take their places at the very end
Their eyes also follow the droning plane

GROUP SHOT

CAPTAIN LOUIS RENAULT a French officer appointed by Vichy
es Prefect of Police in Casablanca Stands chatting with
other officers He is a handsome middle-aged Frenchman
debonair and gay but withal a shrewd and alert official
Around him are clustered the German Consul HERR HEINZE

young Italian officer CAPTAIN TONELLI and Renaults
aide LIEUTENANT CASSELLE Behind them is a detail of
French native soldiers The officers watch the approach-
ing plane as it taxis toward them The German and Italian

( )

detach themselves from the group and walk toward the place
where the Plane will stop The German walks briskly a
step ahead of the Italian who appears to be making an

effort to catch up

THE PLANE - WITH THE SWASTIKA OVER THE DOOR

When the door is opened the first passenger to step out
is a large German wearing heavy horn-rimmed spectacles
He is bland-faced with a perpetual smile that seems more
the result of a frozen face muscle than a cheerful dispo-
sition On any occasion when MAJOR STRASSER is crossed
the smile melts and the expression hardens into iron
Herr Heinze steps up to him with upraised arm

HEINZE
Heil Hitler

STRASSER
(with a more
relaxed gesture)
Heil hitler

They shake hands

HEINZE
(in German)
It is good to see you again Major
Strasser

STRASSER
Cin German)
Thank you thank you

Strasser turns to greet Renault and Casselle who have
come INTO THE SHOT Herr Heinze makes the introduction

HEINZE
(in Engiisb)
May I present Captain Renault
Police Prefect of Casablanca
Major Strasser

The two shake hands

( )

RENAULT
(courteously - but
with just a suggestion
of mockery underneath
his words)
Unoccupied France welcomes you
to Casablanca

STRASSER
(in perfect English -
beaming on the
Frenchman)
Thank you Captain It is very
good to be here

TONELLI
Captain Tonelli of the Italian
staff at your service sir

STRASSER
That is kind of you

TONELLI
Our staff is anxious to cooperate

RENAULT
Major may I present my aide
Lieutenant Casselle

Casselle does not offer to shake hands They merely sal-
ute and bow Renault leads Strasser toward the edge of the
air field where their cars await them Heinze and
Casselle follow with the Italian captain left to bring up
the rear

TRUCKING SHOT - RENAULT AND STRASSER
walking toward the cars

RENAULT
(again the suggestion
of a double-edged
inference)
You may find the climate of Casa-
blanca a trifle warm Major

STRASSER

Oh we Germans must get used to
all climates - from Russia to the
Sahara

(suddenly the smile fades

and the eyes barden)
But perhaps you were not referring
to the weather ( )

RENAULT
(sidesteps the impli-
cation witb a smile)
What else my dear Major

STRASSER
(casual again)
By the way the murder of the
couriers -- what has been done

RENAULT
Realizing the importance of the
case my men are rounding up
twice the usual number of sus-
pects

Again Strasser looks at him sharply

HEINZE
Captain Renault means that the
round-up is a blind We already
know who the murderer is

STRASSER
Good Is he in custody

RENAULT
There is no hurry Tonight he
will come to Rick’s
(indicating the
cafe at the air-
ports edge)
Everybody comes to Ricks

Heinze shrugs to indicate that he can do nothing with
Renault

STRASSER
J bave already beard about this
cafe -- and also about Msieur
Rick himself

RENAULT
Thank you Rick There are many
exit visas sold in this cafe but

them That is the reason we per-
mit you to remain open

balf the world

RENAULT

seilles nor in Oran he will not
leave her in Casablanca

RICK
Maybe hes not as romantic es
you are

RENAULT

It does not matter -- there is no
exit visa for him

RICK
Louis where did you get the idea
1 might be interested in heiping
Laszlo escape

RENAULT

Because my dear Ricky 1 suspect

at heart a sentimentalist

Laugh if you will but I happen to
pe familiar with your recorc Let

with the Ethiopians against Italy
and you risked your neck with the
Royalists in Spain

MED SHOT - RICK RENAULT AND STRASSER

RICK
I was born in New York City if
thatll help you any

STRASSER
(to Rick - very amiably)
I understand you came here from
Paris at the time of the Occupation

RICK
That seems to be no secret

STRASSER
Are you one of those people who
cannot imagine the Germans in
their beloved Paris

( )
Rick reaches over

RICK
Its not particularly my beloved
Paris

HEINZE

(slight laugh)
Can you imagine us in London

RICK
When you get there ask me

STRASSER
(digging into the
caviar)
How about New York

RICK
There are certain sections of New
York Major that 1 would not ad-
vise you to try to invade

STRASSER
Who co you think will win the war

RICK
I bavent the slightest idea

RENAULT
Rick is completely neutral about
everything And that takes in the
field of women too

Strasser takes a little black book from his pocket
riffles tnrough the pages

STRASSER

(to Rick)
You werent always so carefully
neutral We bave a complete
dossier op you

‘Richard Blaine American Age
thirty-seven Cannot return to
bis country

ious tries to look

over Strassers shoulder)
Also Mr Blaine we know why you
left Paris

72 STRASSER

the book)
Are my eyes really brown

STRASSER
You will forgive my curiosity
Mr Blaine The point is an
enemy of the Reich has come to
Casablanca and we are checking
OD anyone who can possibly be
of belp to us

RICK
My interest in Victor Laszlos
staying or going --
(with a glance
toward Renault)
-- is only a sporting one

STRASSER
In this case you have no sympathy
for the fox

RICK
Not particularly I understand
the hounds peint of view too

STRASSER
Victor Laszlo published the foul-
est lies in the Prague newspapers
until the very day we marched in
and even after that he continued
to print scandal sheets ina cellar

RENAULT
Of course one must admit he has
great courage

STRASSER
I admit be is very clever Three
times be slipped through our fin-
gers In Paris he continued his
activities We intend not to let
it happen again

RICK
(rises with a
Slight smile)
Youll excuse me gentlemen Your
business is politics Mine is run-
ning a saloon ( )

all of us From every corner of

Even Nazis cannot kill that fast

RICK
Youre a fat hypocrite You dont

the fact that Ugarte is dead and
no one knows where those Letters
of Transit are

RICK

Practically no one

FERRARI
If 1 could lay my hands on those
Letters I could make a fortune

RICK

Pause

RICK
Theres no use our fencing around
Youve come about those Letters of
Transit havent you

LASZLO
I have

RICK
It seems to be the general impres-
sion in Casablanca that 1 have
those Letters

LASZLO
(looking at him
very steadily)
Have you

RICK
I dont want to do anything tc
either bolster or dispel that
impression

LASZLO
Suppose we proceed under the as-
sumption that you have the Letters

RICK
(shrugging)
Go ahead
LASZLO

Right You must know that its very
important I get out of Casablanca
(simply)
Its my privilege to be one of the
leaders of a great movement You
know what I bave been doing You
know what it means to the work --
to the lives -- of thousands and
thousands of people that I be free
to reach America and continue my
work

RICK
Im not interested in politics
The problems of the world are not
in my department Im a saloon keeper

LASZLO
My friends in the Underground tell me
that you have quite a record You
ran guns to Ethiopia You fought
against the Fascists in Spain

RICK

LASZLO
Isnt it strange that you always
happened to be on the side of the
under-dog

Rick thinks ea moment

Rick
(rises)
Yes 1 found that a very expensive
hobby too But then I never was
much of a business man

LASZLO
Are you enough of a business man
to appreciate an offer of a hundred
thousand francs

RICK
I appreciate it -- but I dont
accept it

LASZLO
Ill raise my offer to two hundred
thousand

RICK

My friend you can make it a million
francs -- or three - my answer
would be the same -

LASZLO
There must be some reason why you
wont let me have them

From the cafe we HEAR THE SOUND of male voices raised in
song Rick gets up

RICK
There is I suggest that you ask
your wife

Laszlo looks at bim puzzled

LASZLO

I beg your pardon
RICK

I said - ask your wife
LASZLO

STRASSER

(under his breath

to Renault)
You see what 1 mean If Laszilos
presence in a cafe can inspire
this unfortunate demonstration
what more will his presence in
Casablanca bring on I advise
that this place be shut up at once

RENAULT

(innocently)
But everybody seems to be having

such a good time

STRASSER
Yes much too good a time The
place is to be closed

RENAULT
But I have no excuse to close it

STRASSER

Find one

Renault thinks a moment then be blows a loud blast on
his whistle The room immediately grows quiet Ail eyes

How can you close me up ‘On

Renault throws (pen the door to the gambling room

RENAULT

STRASSER
It is possible the French author-

ILSA
And the other alternative

LASZLO
Apparently he has the Letters

ILSA
Yes

Ilsa turns away to conceal her emotion She sits on the
edge of the bed Laszlo follows her with his eyes He
is looking at her steadily and thoughtfully - but in no
way antagonistically

LASZLO
But no intention of selling them
One would think if sentiment
wouldnt persuade him money would

ILSA
(111 at once trying to
keep her voice steady )

Did he give any reason

LAS ZLO
He suggested 1 ask you

He said -- ‘ask your wife’ I
dont know why he said that

Ilsa finds it impossible to look at him She looks away

except for the dim light that comes from the shaded
windows

LASZLO

RICK

I told you this morning youd

Your unexpected visit isnt con-
nected by any chance with the

ters Ill never be lonely

ILSA
(looks at him steadily)
Richard you can ask any price
you want But you must give me
those Letters

RICK
I went all through that with your
husband Its no deal

ILSA
I know how you feel about me but
Im asking you to put your feelings

aside for something more important
( )

RICK

Do I have to hear again what a
great man your husband is What
an important Cause hes fighting
for

ILSA
It was your Cause too In your
own Way you were fighting for
the same thing

RICK
Im not fighting for anything any
more -- except myself Im the
only Cause Im interested in

A pause- lisa deliberately takes a new approach

ILSA
Richard we loved each other once
If those days meant anything at
all to you --

RICK

I wouldnt bring up Paris if I
were you Its poor salesmanship

ILSA
Please Please listen to me If

you only knew the truth --

RICK

I wouldnt believe you no matter
what you told me Youll say any-
thing now to get what you want

rest of the world Youre a cow-
ard and a weakling

intently

RICK
And then

ILSA
It wasnt long after we were married
that Victor went back to Czechoslo-
vakia They needed bim in Prague but
there the Gestapo were waiting for him
Just a two line item in the paper
Victor Laszlo apprehended Sent to
concentration camp I1 was frantic

it came He was dead shot trying
to escape 1 was lonely 1 had noth-
ing Not even hope Then 1 met you

RICK
Why werent you honest with me Why
did you keep your marriage a secret

ILSA
Oh it wasnt my secret Richard
Victor wanted it that way Not even
our closest friends knew about our
marriage That was his way of pro-
tecting me I knew so much about his
work and if the Gestapo found out 1
was his wife it would be dangerous
for me and for those working with us

RICK
Well when did you first find out he
was alive

ILSA
Just before you and 1 were to leave
Paris together A friend came and
told me that Victor was alive They
were hiding him in a freight car on
the outskirts of Paris He was sick
he needed me

He is wrapping one of the small bar towels around a cit
in bis wrist Rick comes into the SHOT looks question-
ingly at the injured hand

LASZLO
Its nothing Just a little cut
We had to get through a window

He buttons his cuff down over the towel to hold it in
piace as Rick walks in back of the bar eeiatay up a bottle
of whiskey and pours a drink

RICK
This might come in handy

He shoves the glass across the bar to Laszlo

LASZLO
Thank you

Laszlo takes it in a swallow Rick is now pouring one for
himself

RICK
Had a close one eh

LAS ZLO
Yes rather

RICK

Dont you sometimes wonder if its
worth all this

(Laszlo looks at

him puzzied)
I mean what youre fighting for

LASZLO
We might as well question why we
breathe If we stop breathing
we die If we stop fighting our
enemies the world will die

RICK
What of it Then itll be out of
its misery

( )

LASZLO

Do you know how you sound Msieur
Rick Like a man trying to con-
vince himself of something that in
bis heart he doesnt believe Each
of us has a destiny For good or
for evil

RICK
(drily)
Yes I get the point

With the bottle in his hand Rick starts around toward the
front of the bar Laszlos body turning as he presses Rick
closely

LASZLO
I wonder if you do I wonder if
you know that youre trying to
escape from yourself and that youll
never succeed

Rick looks at Laszlo for a moment then sits down ata
table and begins to pour himself another drink

RICK
(ironically)
You seem to know all about my
destiny

LASZLO
I know a good deal more about you
than you suspect I1 know for in-
stance that you are in love with
a woman

Rick has lifted his glass to drink He puts it down
stares at Laszlo who stands facing him from the bar

LASZLO
(smiles just a little)
It is perhaps a strange circum-
stance that we should be in love
with the same woman

Rick straightens up in his chair watches Laszlo closely
Laszlo walks over to the table

LASZLO
I knew there was something between
you and Ilsa the first evening I
came in this place Since no one
is to blame I demand no explana-
tions I ask only one thing

( )
237 He sits down Their eyes hold across the table

LASZLO
You will not give me the Letters
of Transit All right But 1
want my wife to be safe1 ask
you as a favor to use the Letters
to take her away from Casablanca

Rick looks at Laszlo incredulously

RICK
You love her that much

LASZLO
Apparently you think of me only
as the leader of a Cause Well
I am also a human being
(looks away for a
moment then quietly)
Yes I love her that much

At this moment there is a sharp knock on the front door of
the cafe followed by the entrance of several gendarmes
Rick and Laszlo rise as a French Officer walks into the

lighted area addresses Laszlo

you please Why are you still
interested in what happens to
Laszlo

RICK
Im not But I am interested in
what happens to Ilsa and me We
have a legal right to go thats
true But people have been held
in Casablanca in spite of their
legal rights

RENAULT
What makes you think we want to
bold you

RICK

Ilsa is Laszlos wife She knows
a good deal that Strasser would
like to know Louis 1‘11 make a
deal with you Instead of the
petty charge you have against him
you can get something really big
something that would chuck him

in a concentration camp for years
that would be quite a feather in
your cap wouldnt it
