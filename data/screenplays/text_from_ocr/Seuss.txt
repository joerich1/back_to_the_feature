BLACK SILENCE

Pinpoints of light appear growing first into bright stars then
slowly into various nebulous creatures curious eccentric
whimsical hairy

OLD MAN (VO)

This is the story of a young boy named Ted
and the wonderful things that filled up his
head

We move closer to one figure in particular It is furry black
with white features closer still we see it is an animal
smiling feline

OLD MAN (VO)

Zonks and grommets and tin-armored doves
things that could only exist but for
love

Closer and closer until the figure is obscured - shades of
charcoal fill the screen until finally we see

INT HOUSE -- DAY
A PENCIL TIP coloring a piece of paper

The pencil drops as a young boy - TED 8 dark-haired and
wearing a neatly tied bow tie - is handed a shoulder bag by his
adoring mother - HENRIETTA “NETTIE” GEISEL 30s strong yet
tender He bounds out the front door

OLD MAN (VO)
Love was the thing that was key to his spring
and the people who said you can do anything

Seconds later he runs back in and kisses her cheek then dashes
back out without a word

OLD MAN (VO)
Pushed him and nudged him and gave him the guts
to be who he was though some might say nuts

Nettie picks up Ted’s sketch and smiles a mile wide

EXT CITY STREETS SPRINGFIELD MASSACHUSETTS 1912 -- DAY

Ted marvels at the scene his imagination running wild a baker

tossing a loaf of bread to a man with a wide handlebar moustache
a dog catcher with an oversized net a butcher curiously juggling
fish a MAN IN A TALL TOP HAT bending low as a lady passes

A signpost marks the thoroughfare this is MULBERRY STREET
OLD MAN (VO)
You have to believe in this magic you see
defy those who say it can’t possibly be

Suddenly a rock whizzes by Ted’s head then another nearly
missing him A group of BULLIES appear from around a corner
Ted takes off as amidst another volley of rocks

A WILD CHASE ENSUES as Ted runs through the city Only steps
ahead of his attackers he scrambles past dumpsters and trucks

OLD MAN (VO)
Through bad times and good believe yes you should
For it’s magic so strong it turns terrible good

Rocks continue to sail but as they hit building facades in his
wake they mysteriously burst into splashes of brilliant color
like splatters of paint

Ted finally emerges in front of a school building and sprints up
the steps through the front door safe for the day

OLD MAN (VO)

I tell you the truth I promise you’1ll see
I know this because it all happened

to me

SMASH TO BLACK

A single title card fades in SEUSS

INT PRINCIPALS OFFICE -- DAY

A stern-looking PRINCIPAL - 50s proper - shuffles a stack of
loose-leaf paper Ted sits quietly across from him

The Principal holds up a page presenting an ambiguous-looking
design to the boy

TED
Bird

He shuffles again presenting another drawing

TED (CONTD)
Lion

And another

TED (CONTD)
Duck-dog

Frowning now the Principal shifts in his seat Then one more
TED (CONTD)
Zizzer-zazzer-Zuzz

PRINCIPAL
Son there is no such thing as a--

The office door CREAKS opens as a grim-faced man enters eyes
locked on the boy who lowers his head This is TR GEISEL -
30s burly cold and most importantly Ted’s father

PRINCIPAL (CONTD)
Mr Geisel thank you for coming We
were just reviewing your sons
arithmetic assignments

TR approaches the desk and flips through the pages not an
ounce of arithmetic to be found amongst the odd drawings

PRINCIPAL (CONTD)
You see our concern

TR barely masking a fuming rage returns the pages to the
corner of the Principal’s desk In his heavy German accent

TR
Indeed Thank you

TR storms out Ted musters a brave smile at the Principal
then takes his drawings and stuffs them into his pockets as he
hurries out the door

INT MOTORCAR -- MOMENTS LATER

Father and son ride in total silence neither one breaking it
Ted stares out the window

TR
You are wasting your education Making a
mockery of this family

The lack of reaction from the boy suggests this isn’t a new
criticism After a beat he turns pointedly to TR

TED
Once six is six two sixes are twelve
three sixes are eighteen four sixes are
twenty-four five sixes are--

TR
Enough

Ted looks back out the window vindicated
INT GEISEL HOME -- DUSK

An anxious-looking Nettie puts the finishing touches on the
family meal doffing her apron as the front door SLAMS

NETTIE
What happened

TR drags Ted into his bedroom by the scruff of his coat then
swiftly collects the BRIGHTLY-STRIPED SKETCHBOOK and pencils on
his desk He shuts the door and locks it behind him

TR
You coddle him too much

INT BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Ted finds a nub of a pencil under his bed and draws on the
floorboards A HEATED ARGUMENT echoes through the walls

NETTIE (0S)
He’s eight years old He’s just a boy

TR (0S)
Then he’s ten then fourteen then twenty-
four then fifty When does it end

Ted pulls the school drawings from his pockets which bear a
resemblance to the odd-looking stuffed animals around his room

NETTIE (0S)
Never If that’s who he is

TR (0S)
He will amount to nothing if you continue
to indulge these doodles
With a sudden burst Ted rips the drawings apart one after the

next Slumped on the floor he screws his eyes shut amidst the
shreds as the argument in the next room continues

INT BEDROOM -- LATER

Nighttime Silence Ted stares up at the ceiling when the lock
to his door turns with a CLINK Nettie peeks in

NETTIE
Thought you might be hungry

She offers him a plate of food which he tears into

TED
Why does he hate me so much
NETTIE
(heart breaking)
Come here Your father doesn’t hate you
Not one bit He just has no imagination
You want to know a little secret I
think it’s maybe because he feels left
out

TED
Left out of what

NETTIE
The wonderful world of things that live
up here
(she taps his head then
his chest)
And in here

Young Ted struggles to absorb this

NETTIE (CONTD)
Do you want to tell me what happened
today Did you see anything you liked
(then with a twinkle in
her eye)
Anything wild and amazing and
extraordinary

Ted brightens - this is a game that’s been played many times

TED
I walked down Mulberry Street to school

NETTIE
Well there’s not much to see on Mulberry
Street

TED
There is

NETTIE
Tell me

INTERCUT WITH
EXT MULBERRY STREET -- DAY

Ted back on the city streets Only this time the roadway is
plain sepia devoid of color A blank canvas

A nondescript horse and buggy appear

TED (0OS)
A horse And a wagon
NETTIE (0S)
A plain old horse and wagon

The horse and buggy transform before our eyes into

TED (0OS)
I mean a zebra And a charioteer

NETTIE (0S)
And maybe an elephant

Ted and Nettie stand by the side of the road now watching the
parade materialize in front of them

TED
Yes A zebra a charioteer an elephant
and a brass band and a raja--

NETTIE

Ooh a real live raja

Ted is now by himself in the middle of the menagerie the
ringleader of the show that continues to unfold around him

TED

Yes And jugglers and policemen and
and the mayor

BACK TO SCENE

INT BEDROOM -- SAME

Ted breaks into giggles as Nettie hugs him tightly

NETTIE
Quiet now you’ll wake your father

Nettie hums quietly as the boy closes his eyes

TED
Stay a while

NETTIE
Always

After a moment she looks up to see TR in the open crack of
the doorway His face remains stoic then vanishes

Nettie turns back to Ted and gently touches his head
NETTIE (CONTD)

Youre off to great places

CUT TO
INT GEISEL HOME -- LA JOLLA CALIFORNIA -
A cocktail party in full swing guests mingle and imbibe
appetizers are passed TED GEISEL now mid-50s stands awkwardly
at the center of attention with his wife HELEN GEISEL 50s

AUDREY DIAMOND late 30s stands next to husband GREY and raises
a flute of champagne TING TING TING

AUDREY
It’s an honor to see so many friendly
faces tonight Thank you all for coming--

TED
To my house

AUDREY
We couldn’t very well get you to
celebrate anywhere else now could we

A few CHUCKLES around the room

TED
I know you’re only here for the
canapes Especially you boys from

Random House
Two JUNIOR EXECUTIVES in the back of the room raise a glass

AUDREY
To your latest book Ted - may it charm
and delight the rest of the world as much
as it has all of us

A few HEAR-HEARS round up the toast Helen wraps a protective
arm around Ted as the congratulatory crowd descends

JUNIOR EXEC 1
(aside)
How’s it tracking

JUNIOR EXEC 2 just shakes his head

JUNIOR EXEC 1 (CONT’D)
Are the rumors true

A portly gruff BENNETT CERF 50s approaches Ted and Helen
across the room Ted embraces him warmly

JUNIOR EXEC 2
Poor son-of-a-bitch doesn’t even see it
coming

Cerf breaks the embrace
CERF
(to Ted)
Have a moment

TED
Of course

INT GEISEL HOME -- STUDY -- MOMENTS LATER

Ted takes a seat at a large desk gestures for Cerf to sit
Helen stands to the side

CERF
(indicating Helen)
Id rather imagined we’d be alone--

HELEN
We are
CERF
(miffed)

Of course Ted you know I’m not much
for small talk so let’s cut to it
We’re not picking up your contract

Teds face drops The LAUGHTER of the crowd in the next room
fills the silence

TED
Impeccable timing Bennett--

HELEN
This is ludicrous Everyone loves Ted’s
books Walter at the Times--

CERF
Teds books don’t sell Helen And I
can’t publish books that no one buys no
matter who likes them This little
experiment is over

HELEN
Thidwick McElligot’s Pool the
Bartholomew Books-- you call these an
experiment

CERF
A failed one

HELEN
Fine We’ll go to Scheuster or Houghton
Mifflin or--

CERF
They won’t bite
Helen scoffs

HELEN
Old boys’ network alive and well is it
Bennett

CERF

Everyone’s pushing for primers Helen

TED
Early readers are hot now Bennet

HELEN
So Ted will write you a primer

CERF
All due respect Ted’s books are filled
with nonsense The “Jungle of Nool”
“Horton” And “Whos” And--

TED
Youd prefer Dick and Jane See Dick
Run See Dick get stabbed in the back by
his publisher

CERF
Ted

HELEN
Dropping Ted cold sales or no sales is
going to raise some eyebrows

CERF
Raised eyebrows I can handle Red ink I
can’t

TED

You’re making a mistake Bennett
Cerf studies Ted measuring his response Sighs
CERF
Tell you what I’ve got a list of words -
300 of them
He pulls a piece of paper from his lapel pocket
CERF (CONTD)
Unrelated beginner words-- some sort
of bureaucratic educational decree I

need to turn them into a book

Ted takes the list reads
TED
(sarcastic)

Rain house bump fish cat This one

should write itself

CERF
I can’t make heads or tails of it and

neither can any editor in town You do

this we’ll talk

HELEN
Done

They both turn to Ted who shrugs

TED
Okay

CERF
I need it fast

Cerf stands and turns back at the study door

CERF (CONTD)
“Oobleck” is not on the list

HELEN
We understand

As Cerf exits sounds of the party bleed into the room

wipes a crease in his forehead defeated

TED
So I’ll go back to writing ads

Helen goes to him

HELEN
You can do this Ted

TED

A primer I don’t even know where Id

start how I can--

HELEN
Hey

She places a hand on his chest

HELEN (CONT’D)
It’s all right here Just be you

Ted

Ted melts dismissing his troubles with a wave of his hand

TED
So are we celebrating Or what

INT GEISEL HOME -- LIVING ROOM -- LATER

Ted Helen Audrey and a small group of friends stand around a
baby grand singing as Grey plays “As Time Goes By” Everyone
is tipsy and enjoying themselves to the fullest

As the final chorus winds up Ted’s eyes meet Helen’s across the
piano They smile - this is a couple for the ages

Suddenly Helen stiffens then stumbles as her knees buckle
She claws at the piano as she falls landing in a heap on the
floor amidst a flurry of GASPS Ted rushes over

INT HOSPITAL -- EARLY MORNING

Ted sits with head in hands in a waiting room chair - he’s
clearly been here all night He is disheveled eyes bloodshot

DR ADAM DAVIS 40s approaches Ted jumps to his feet

DR DAVIS
Sit Mr Geisel Girls taking okay care
of you Show you the way to the
cafeteria some coffee

TED
Doc please spill it

DR DAVIS
Pathology indicates that your wife’s
body’s immune system is attacking her
nerves -- it’s called Guillain-Barre
syndrome Usually starts with weakness
and tingling in the extremities -
sometimes rarely - symptoms progress
very rapidly with complete paralysis of
legs arms and breathing muscles over the
course of a few hours That’s where we
are with Helen Mr Geisel

Ted face registers shock horror

DR DAVIS (CONTD)
It is treatable with plasmapheresis -
blood cleansing - which we do through a
series of transfusions The first is
underway

TED
She’s paralyzed

INT HOSPITAL ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

The room is filled with archaic beeping machines glass bottles
and tubes We forget what medicine looked like 60 years ago

Helen is encased in a cold airtight metal cylinder that looks
like a medieval torture device Only her head is visible This
is an IRON LUNG

DR DAVIS (0S)
Thing’s keeping her alive Doing the
breathing for her Best we can do right
now

IN THE HALLWAY Ted looks in through the window face ashen
Helen alone stares at the ceiling blinking back tears
INT HOSPITAL HALLWAY -- SAME

Ted wanders down the hallway shell-shocked and finds himself
standing before the nurse station

NURSE

Ted beams under his father’s tacit approval
TR (CONTD)
This is a first for the Geisels I

crashing to the ground

Mac springs to his feet and launches the suitcase shot-put style

MAC (CONT’D)

One of the bears edges close to Ted and the ham hock spurring
him into terrified action

TED (CONTD)
Okay here you go fella That’s right

ham hock gauging a huge bite inches from Ted’s fingers

wagon

Ted cautiously opens the cage and the first cub walks straight
onto Sam’s car The second cub starts out then pivots on Ted
and rears on its hind legs dangerously close

TED
Um Sam-- I am

ZOOKEEPER SAM

The cub slams its paws against the cage pinning Ted above the
shoulders The bear sniffs his face then suddenly licks him
with a sloppy wet bear tongue and turns to join the other

Old man problem

TED
Old man problem - you mean my father

MAC
No I mean you’re 18-years-old and you’re
acting like you’re an old man

Ted doesn’t bite

MAC (CONT’D)
You know my father always expected I
would go off to school and come back a
‘man of the cloth’ like him True
story And I started out intending to
stick to the plan - religion philosophy
Greek Hebrew Problem was one day I
woke up and discovered that I hated
myself Day after day week after week
And all the sudden I was miserable
Wouldn’t have known fun if it bit me on
the ass

Ted absorbs this

TED
And now you run Jacko

Mac shrugs

TED (CONTD)
What did you say to your dad

MAC
I told him life’s too short to walk in
someone else’s shoes

Ted stares out at the horizon the rolling hills the autumn
colors creating a vibrant patchwork vision

MAC (CONTD)
Gotta have something to live for

CUT TO

INT HOSPITAL ROOM -- 1955 -- NIGHT

Ted walks into Helens room leaving Audrey at the door As he
approaches the iron lung the rhythmic pump beep and hiss of
the machinery temporarily overwhelm him He finds Helen’s eyes

At the sight of him silent tears stream down Helen’s face Ted
kneels down and places his head next to hers struggling to hold
it together
TED

You know you can’t get rid of me that

easy
Helen sobs laughing and crying simultaneously Ted produces a
tattered old card from his pocket It’s a faded sketch of a
young woman

TED (CONTD)
Remember this old gal

Helen takes a deep breath a twinkle in her eye Ted smiles and
stays with her

A LOUD KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK

CUT TO

INT TED’S DORM ROOM -- 1922 -- DAY

The knocking persists as young Ted dabs at a giant mural on his
wall with a paintbrush - it’s a scene of two playful bear cubs

TED
One second

Brush still in hand Ted swings open his door to find his
father TR staring coldly Nettie standing behind him

TR
Theodor

TED
Father Mother What are you--

TR
You haven’t written or called since you
arrived

TED
I’ve been busy

Studying

Indeed

TR frowns at the mural as Ted drops the brush

TED
This this is nothing

TR

adventure for us

TR turns as Nettie lingers to admire the mural

TED
(impressed)
An adventure

INT HOTEL CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY

A bulletin board reads “WELCOME BOSTON AREA ROTARY
BUSINESSMEN” Dozens of stuffy humorless late-50s men in coats
and ties mingle about making idle conversation

Ted stares blankly at a BUSINESSMAN chewing an hors d’oeuvres
talking out the side of his mouth

BUSINESSMAN
That’s the advantage of the IS In the
case of multiple gobs the shears cut the
gobs simultaneously and they fall into
the blank moulds in parallel--

A waiter walks by with a tray of appetizers

BUSINESSMAN (CONT’D)
Do excuse me

As he and TR trail off after the grub Nettie leans in

NETTIE
Some adventure isn’t it

OFF Ted his mother’s humor the only saving grace

INT RESTAURANT BOSTON -- LATER

TR talks enthusiastically drawing a diagram on a scrap of
paper as Ted mindlessly spoons soup

TR
If we can recalibrate the furnaces to
accommodate the new process then we just
might make it We can cut corners by
eliminating the dealkalinization

As TR trails on Ted’s gaze lands on Helen the girl from
Mac’s party Her smile lights up the restaurant as she laughs
aloud enjoying a joke from her friends Ted involuntarily
chuckles as well swept up in her vibe

TR (CONTD)
Theodor this is important

TED
Yes sir

But Ted remains distracted as he sees Helen rise from her table

TED (CONTD)
Excuse me Sorry dad

TR sighs in frustration - Nettie smiles knowingly

Ted heads off but lingers at the register He grabs a blank
order card from the counter and a pencil and begins sketching

As Helen arrives she stands behind Ted waiting patiently

HELEN
Excuse me are you in line

TED
Me No

HELEN
Hey - Dartmouth guy right At the
party with the hat

TR glares from across the room

TED
No I mean yes

HELEN
I’m sorry

Ted turns and hands Helen the order form

TED
For you

The sketch bears a striking resemblance to Helen complete with
a towering hairdo She smiles

HELEN
I hadn’t realized quite how bad a hair
day it was until just now

TED
It’s beautiful Your hair

Ted turns to leave but Helen grabs his wrist puts the drawing
in his hand

HELEN
You keep it

TED
But it’s for you--

HELEN
This way you’ll never forget me

Her eyes twinkle as she turns away Ted beams

EXT TED’S DORM -- DAY
Nettie walks Ted to his dorm as TR idles in the car

NETTIE
It’s a lot to take in all at once being
here Everything so new so much
happening go easy on yourself

TED
It just feels like a lot of pressure To
do the right thing be the right--

NETTIE
Just don’t get hung up - keep going right
along Being you Maybe think about
drawing again Or maybe you already
have

They stop at the entrance to his dorm Ted kisses her cheek

NETTIE (CONTD)
Girl at the diner was a cutie

She winks at Ted - their secret

CUT TO

INT HOSPITAL ROOM -- 1955 -- DAY

Ted stands at the window gazing out at the view adjusting a
and tilting a small handheld mirror on the sill

Dr Davis enters and stumbles over a standing mirror barely
catching it before it smashes to the ground

TED
Careful Doc That’s seven years I don’t
have

DR DAVIS

What are you doing

The room is filled with a series of mirrors in a a visual relay
Inside the iron lung Helen barely manages a smile but her eyes
glisten with joy

TED
Changing the scenery

DR DAVIS
Where did you get all these mirrors

TED
Around Here and there Everywhere

Ted slaps a final piece of duct tape on an accordion-arm mirror
connecting it to a rolling IV stand

TED (CONTD)

Give me a hand here Doc Or rather a
foot Stand here - needs a counter-
weight

With the Doctor’s foot securing the IV stand Ted extends the
mirror over the iron lung directly above Helen’s eyes

TED (CONTD)
(to Helen)
Don’t move Just kidding

Ted runs out of the room then pops back in

TED (CONTD)
You either Doc

And he’s gone The Doctor stands impatiently Finally a
distant BARKING echoes through the room

From Helen’s POV in the mirror we see an upside down image of
Ted leading a DOG down the path running outside Helen’s window

INTERCUT WITH

EXT HOSPITAL GROUNDS -- OUTSIDE HELEN’S WINDOW -- SAME
As Ted reaches the mirror the pup BARKS into it

TED
See someone you know there don’t ya

BARK BARK The dog licks the mirror

TED (CONTD)

Atta boy He really misses you Helen
(then)

Doc how’s she doing

DR DAVIS
She’s smiling

Helen suddenly breaks into a weak laughter which builds
TED
(alarmed)
Is she okay

Doctor Davis checks a gauge on the iron lung adjusts it

DR DAVIS
Take a deep breath Helen can you

Helen’s laughter calms she inhales carefully then nods As
the muscle control returns to her mouth her speech is garbled

HELEN
Uh huh Yes yes I can

As Ted climbs through the window--

DR DAVIS
She’s breathing on her own Mr Geisel

TED
Well get her out of that thing already

Helen sees Ted and bursts into a SOB of happiness Dr Davis
unclasps a few latches and with a dramatic HISS the iron lung
is open With Ted’s help they slide Helen out

DR DAVIS
Your fingers your toes try wiggling
them

Ted grabs Helen’s hand With considerable effort and
concentration Helens limp fingers slowly contract and squeeze

As Ernest’s pleading sends the guys into another round of
subdued laughter a resolve spreads across Ted’s face

the mountain the Jacko Staffers’ faces drop

CHARLIE

montage of his attempts each of which he tears off his sketch
pad and crinkles into a ball

with a plate of green ham

Mac paces behind the staff peering over shoulders

loaded on the back of pick up next to the barn Only one window

is lit

Peeking in he sees the OLD BOOTLEGGER- 60s bent over
in a lime green quilt next to the fire bushy brow and

pair of kegs roll into Ted’s truck finally getting the
Bootlegger’s attention She jumps back in and fires up the
truck’s engine

and beelines for the truck No sooner does he hit the yard when

not to hurt the harmless pup

ground which FIRES upon impact taking out a tree right beside
them

Ted dives in the open passenger side door Helen peels out
Leaving the Bootlegger in the dust they burst out laughing

Ted and Audrey have a good laugh

There I am skis strapped to my feet
tethered to a model T - water slash snow
skiing at 30 miles an hour as I’m hauled
across campus Many a close call on
many an adventure

AUDREY
And youll have many more I’m sure of
it

A swell laps into the boat knocking Audrey off balance and
into Ted’s arms They stare into each other’s eyes for an
awkward moment

TED
Well see
Helen and Grey emerge just as Ted and Audrey untangle

themselves

A labored silence hangs

HELEN
You see Grey - I knew we were missing
all the fun inside

AUDREY

Helen Feeling better

HELEN
Don’t quite have my sea-legs yet

EXT HARBOR PARKING LOT -- LATER

as the boat approaches the harbor

Helen and Ted walk towards their car in silence Helen a step

ahead

Ted stops abruptly

TED
I’m going to catch a taxi down to the gas
lamp for a nightcap if you don’t mind

HELEN
(suddenly in a rage)
Of course I mind And the hell you are
Youre going to drive your wife home

TED
Of course I am

Helen stops abruptly

HELEN
You know what Go Do whatever it is
you need to do See if Mrs Diamond
might like to meet for a drink

TED
Audrey Helen come on you’re being
ridiculous--

HELEN
Give me the keys I don’t need your
condescension

TED
Helen please you’re tired--

HELEN
And I certainly don’t need your pity

She grabs the keys and storms towards their car - Ted follows at
a distance

HELEN (CONTD)
Stop following me like some sad puppy
Here around the house into the kitchen
into the bathroom I am not an
invalid

Helen gets in the car and screeches out of the lot - several
BYSTANDERS look on

TED
(shouting after)
And I’m not a puppy
(then to bystanders)
Woman’s got fire

INT LA JOLLA HOME -- THE NEXT MORNING

INT LA JOLLA HOME - STUDIO -- CONTINUOUS

Ted wields a large brush painting broad blue strokes across a
sprawling canvas He keeps at it as Helen enters

TED
Hi

HELEN
Hi

What are you doing

Ted looks over his canvas at Helen mischief in his eye

TED
Staying out of trouble

HELEN
I mean what are you painting

TED
Oh that

Ted turns his easel around so Helen can see - it’s a tiny patch
of land in the middle of a wide ocean

TED (CONTD)
It’s our island Just big enough for
two I can’t help but follow you around
see It’s too small No matter where we
go the other of us is right there Like
always Remember

This catches Helen off guard - she is visibly moved

EXT FERRY -- 1923 -- AERIAL OVER

Young Ted bursting with excitement standing at the boat’s bow
as it motors across the wide blue sound a beautiful sight

EXT NANTUCKET FERRY DOCKS -- LATER

The landing is a tableau of wealth - fancy cars men and women
dressed in their summer best parasols and chauffeurs

Ted wearing his trademark bow-tie stands out like a sore thumb
as he searches the crowd

TED
Now Where are you Helen Palmer

EXT CLIFFSIDE BEACH CLUB -- MOMENTS LATER

Ted has made his way down to the shore and soaks it all in the
ocean cabanas sailboats A large sign reads “CLIFFSIDE BEACH
CLUB NO TRESPASSING” which Ted wanders right by

TED
Amazing

There a group of PREPSTERS toss around a football a few girls
watching on the sidelines Ted smiles - one girl giggles and
elbows a friend as a MAN IN A SUIT approaches

MAN IN SUIT
Excuse me sir Members only

TED
Pardon It’s the beach--

MAN IN SUIT
Members Only

Suit Man escorts Ted past the Prepsters and girls who look at
him disparagingly Ted is shades of red

TED
Bully

EXT PUBLIC BEACH -- LATER

Ted looks out over the vast expanse of water the cliffs by the
shoreline and the hotel beach he’s just been booted from With
a heavy sigh he closes his eyes and soaks up the warm sun

Suddenly SPLASH A bucket of ice-cold Atlantic water is dumped
on Ted’s head jolting him from his slumber He looks up to
find Helen proudly standing above him

HELEN
Oh I’m sorry did I just dump a bucket
of icy water on your head on purpose

Helen plunks down next to him in the sand

TED
You know that snow drift was meant to be
for someone else

HELEN
Oh I think it was definitely meant to
be
(then)
Hi See island’s not so big

TED
Big enough for two

HELEN
Glad I wandered off the reservation

TED
I believe this is where I’m supposed to
ask you for a dance

HELEN
Or a stroll along the water

Ted stands and reaches out his hand

HELEN (CONTD)
I thought you’d never ask

Helen sneaks a quick kiss to Ted’s lips then playfully sprints
ahead Ted is smitten

EXT BEACH CLUB CAFE -- LATER

American flags and red-white-and-blue streamers decorate the
cafe - a July 4th theme in progress

Helen indicates a group of girls on the beach

HELEN
They’ve been here every year since they
were little girls We were all close
back at school so they dragged me
along Prolonging our good-byes till the
end of summer

TED
Avoid growing up at all costs

HELEN
Something like that

TED
So you’re not one of them

HELEN
No just visiting Like you

Ted hands the Waiter a soggy bill He snorts and heads off

TED (CONTD)
(calling after)
Thank you

HELEN
Well la-di-da

Ted gestures over to two stuffy OLDER MEN in animated
conversation at a table nearby Ted mocks from a distance

TED
“Good one Sylvester McMoney Have I
shown you my Duesenberg Fastest
reddest car on the island” Damn
sneetches

HELEN
Sneetches

TED
(matter of fact)
Snooty beaches
(then yelling over)
Sneetches

HELEN
(laughing)
Shhhh Aren’t you embarrassed
Ted suddenly

A beat

TED
Oh I embarrass myself all the time

HELEN
I find that hard to believe

TED
Honest As long as I can remember
Actually here’s a story So when I was
a kid I was in the Boy Scouts--

HELEN
I bet you were adorable

TED
Of course but listen One summer we
all sold these war bonds And the five
of us that sold the most war bonds won a
medal

HELEN
Oooh a medal

TED
But these were no ordinary medals - they
were to be presented by the then former
President Theodore Roosevelt himself

HELEN
(serious now)
That’s a big deal Ted You won one

TED

So there I am on the stage watching as
he places the medals on the first four
boys one by one until he finally gets
to me Thing is at this point he’s run
out of medals They miscounted or
misplaced one who knows But instead of
owning up to it the former President in
front of the entire town of Springfield
my parents every kid in school bellows
“What’s this little boy doing here”

(then sobering)
Then he turns and bears down on me
squinting his eyes and he says “Who are
you” And then storms off leaving me
center stage out to dry

laughs like he’s delivered a punch line

TED (CONTD)
Like I was invisible

HELEN
That’s the saddest thing I’ve ever heard

Ted shrugs Helen slips her hand into Ted’s

HELEN (CONT’D)
Sneetches I like it They have their
club we’ll have ours

EXT NANTUCKET HOUSE -- 1923 -- NIGHT

Fireworks light up the sky as the party gathers outside Ted
takes Helen by the hand and together they slip away

He grabs a bicycle and rolls it over to Helen She jumps on
holding tight as Ted zig-zags out onto the coastal road

HELEN
(laughing)
Where are we going

TED
On a hunt for the elusive baboona

HELEN

dunes chasing each other through the soft tide their mutual
affection growing with each passing moment

As the sun rises over the water Helen returns from freshening
up at a roadside diner to find Ted sketching the stunning
horizon on a napkin

EXT NANTUCKET ROAD -- DAWN

Back on the bicycle Ted swerves to avoid colliding with a
stubborn seagull and lands the bike in a ditch with a CRASH

Helen lies limp her legs tangled with Ted’s He panics

TED
Helen Oh my god Helen are you okay

Ted puts his face down by her mouth to check for breathing wild-
eyed After a beat she BITES his ear giggling

TED (CONTD)
Oh my god I thought you were dead

HELEN
No just compromised

Her skirt rides dangerously high up her leg
TED
I think this is what they call a ‘happy
accident’

She giggles harder pulls Ted in for a long kiss

HELEN
You are one-of-a-kind Ted Geisel

TED
Marry me

HELEN

(laughing hard now)

What

TED

Unable to resist any longer she pulls him down on top of her

HELEN
Okay maybe

Their laughter fades as their passion builds

EXT LA JOLLA BEACH -- DAY -
Adult Helen and Ted stroll on the beach hand in hand Though
her strength has returned Ted walks slowly to support her

TED
So the star-free Sneetches get a visit
from a fix-it-up chap who offers to put
stars on their bellies for a price He
creates an all out star war

HELEN
Okay but no fad lasts forever How
about having stars be in fashion then
they’re out in then out--

TED
And it goes on and on until the chap has
bled the entire Sneetch beach dry taken
all their last pennies

HELEN
(with a smirk)
No resentment there Ted

TED
None at all

HELEN
And so the Sneetches finally get their
due I love it

TED
I’ve also got this idea about a guy named
Sam-- his name is Sam-I-Am actually--
isn’t that great Who loves green ham
and he tries to convince some poor schlub
to taste it--

Helen stops

HELEN
What about the primer

TED
It’s coming

HELEN
Really

TED
(he taps his head)
It’s all up in here Somewhere I just
have to figure out how to get it out

HELEN
You still haven’t started

Ted is silent

HELEN (CONTD)
Ted All of these ideas-- the Sneetches
Sam-I-Am everything They won’t amount
to a thing if no one is publishing you

TED
Do we really need a publisher Hel I
mean these new stories are fantastic
And fantastical Everyone’s going to
love--

HELEN
Who Ted Who’s going to love them
Critics friends Ted Not the public
That’s all that matters Cerf’s right
if you don’t deliver this primer none of
these-- none - will ever get printed

TED
The primer the primer the primer

HELEN
So get it done It’s the same as

We can do this together Ted

Helen holds out her hand which Ted takes She rests her head
on his shoulder as they continue walking down the beach
INT GEISEL HOME KITCHEN -- 1956 -- DAY

Adult Helen looks over some of Ted’s sketches early versions of
Sam-I-Am the Grinch the Sneetches She is quietly impressed

TED
Gabberynacky

Ted balls up the primer word-list and tosses it
TED

(CONTD)

This is stupid

Helen retrieves the list un-balls it and places it back in

front of Ted

He stands and shuffles over to the stairs up to his tower

office

HELEN

Try again

TED

Start with the fun words

There aren’t any

HELEN

Sure there are

TED
Okay HAT

There once was a fun fun

it the Fun Hat-- this is ridiculous

HELEN
Better than half the primers I’ve read

TED

I can’t even use the word “people”

HELEN
Don’t think about the words you can’t

use

TED

The ones I can use don’t fit

None of

this makes any sense

HELEN

Since when did that concern you
your imagination
start with “hat”

TED

I’ve drawn hats before

Use
You picked “hat”
Go draw a hat

500 of them

HELEN

Ted go do something
there is not any fun and it’s not going

to get this thing written

TED
Fine

Fish is definitely not fun Oh but
“cat” is Now there’s a fun one That
fun fun cat lLet’s go play upstairs

Ted takes the list and drags himself upstairs Helen smiles
with self-satisfaction

INT STUDIO -- MOMENTS LATER

Ted stares at a sheet of paper where he’s assembled all the
words that could potentially rhyme He puts pencil to paper
Stops Nothing He sighs big

TED
Hat cat gown down net bet tricks
kicks play say

In a burst of exasperation he throws his entire sketch pad out
the window with a frustrated SHOUT Outside the papers shuffle
in the breeze above the garden

Ted looks around his studio notices that a picture frame was
knocked askew in the ruckus He moves to right it and we focus
on the frame’s subject a young Helen beneath the brim of an
oversized sun hat

He turns back to his desk grabs another sketch pad

Now there’s a hat

He sketches the outline of a familiar face of a grinning feline
in a floppy top hat He sits back then--

Helen sees the papers floating outside shoots an inquisitive
looks upstairs

All smiles she heads for the stairs but on the second one her
knee buckles and she catches herself just before falling She
winces her face registering pain and fear

HELEN

Just in the middle of something I’11
come see in a bit okay

INT SCOTTIE’S TAVERN -- 1924 NIGHT

In a rustic campus diner prettied up for the occasion an
emotional MRS PALMER late-50s simple makes a toast

MRS PALMER
I want to thank you all for making it up
to this beautiful New England campus to
celebrate this wonderful engagement

TR and Nettie flank the young couple as Mac and a few of
Helen’s friends look on CAT-CALLS from the back of the room
reveal the Jacko Staffers also in attendance

MRS PALMER (CONTD)
I must admit although the news certainly
comes as shock--—

WILDER
(to Charlie)
She marries me that’d be a shock

MRS PALMER
I’m relieved to know that Theodor is a
bright young man from a good family with
a promising future If you’d all be so
kind as to raise a glass

As Mrs Palmer’s emotions overcome her TR takes over

TR
To their bright futures
(to Helen)
In the classroom--
(to Ted)
And in business

HERE-HEREs abound as the crowd mingles Ted wipes his brow
MAC
Still thinks you’re coming home to run
the family store huh

TED
Hasn’t exactly come up lately

MAC
You might want to get on that

Nettie approaches Ted and Helen
NETTIE
I think it’s time to let the boys be
boys I’m so happy for you both

HELEN
I’1l walk with you Mrs Geisel

NETTIE
Lovely Shall we

Glowing with pride she kisses Ted on the cheek and exits

EXT CAMPUS STREETS -- MOMENTS LATER

HELEN
It was a lovely reception My sincerest
gratitude for the manner in which you’ve
accepted me into your family

NETTIE
Of course

HELEN
Mr Geisel seemed in good spirits

They walk in silence

NETTIE
I worry for him

Helen is taken aback by Nettie’s candor

HELEN
Oh

NETTIE
My dear of course you’ve noticed He’s
so concerned with duty I fear it
will be his undoing

Unsure how to respond Helen does her best
HELEN

Perhaps he’s not cut of the same cloth as

most men--

NETTIE

He mustn’t be bogged down and consumed by

the mundane - real life if you will
must be kept on course - his course

He

Which to many may seem adrift but as we

know is far from it

Helen now thoroughly at a loss can fake it no longer

HELEN

Mr Geisel adrift Mrs Geisel I--

NETTIE
Theodor my dear Ted
(then pointedly)

He’s no ordinary young man See to it he

stays that way

INT SCOTTIE’S TAVERN BACK ROOM -- LATER

The mood has changed as the Jacko crew holds court in the

Mac TINGS the side of a beer stein with a fork

MAC

I have an announcement folks believe it

or not the college finally got sick of
me hanging around campus still pretending

to be a student after graduation

WILDER
Aren’t we all

The crowd of staffers laugh TR off to the side

MAC
So they hired me to teach--

CHARLIE

Professor Maclean - to the demise of

higher education

MAC

-and made me the inaugural faculty
advisor to the Jack-o-lantern so you

just can’t get rid of me that easy
This sends the staff into an uproar

CHARLIE
Youre like the clap

bar

frowns

They sing a round of “Here’s to Chick Maynard” which ends
ceremoniously as always with Mac chugging a beer

TED
When did all this go down

MAC
While you were off falling in love some
of us were planning our futures Now
after careful consideration--

CHARLIE
Careful my ass

MAC
And with nearly unanimous consent--

WILDER
More like lack of alternatives

MAC
The staff of the Jacko have elected
Ted Geisel as our next editor in chief

STAFFERS
Hear-Hear Congrats Ted Cheers

The crew breaks into another round of Chick Maynard

TED
I still don’t even know who Chick Maynard
is

MAC

Worst pro athlete--

CHARLIE
Drink Ted

Ted chugs the song-ending beer and Mac throws an arm over his
shoulder

MAC
This is going to open a lot of doors
Ted Just you wait and see

At the other end of the bar TR fumes

INT SCOTTIE’S TAVERN -- EVEN LATER

TR and Ted sit in a back booth mid-argument
TR
So what do you plan to do Deposit
pictures you’ve drawn at the bank Write
a limerick at the grocery

TED
(incensed)
Of course not--

TR
And what about the business The fact that
youre choosing to just give that up--

TED
I never had a choice

TR
Never had a choice we talked for years
about this--

TED
Geisel and Geisel is the only thing youd
ever talk to me about

TR

(sarcastic)
Oh you had it so hard Theodor

(then)
I started working at my father’s brewery
when I was barely old enough to count
and I never took a single day for
granted I worked hard and stuck to the
plan And I made a life for myself and
my family

TED

You sure that’s how it went All those
years after the brewery shut down you
did nothing Never a word to us except
when you felt the need to criticize the
whole world - criticize us - for your
troubles

(then pointed)
I’m not going down that path

TR’s eyes grow cold
TR
You’re making a mistake Theodor And I
will not stand by idly and watch you
throw away your life

Ted leans in

TED
Like you did

In a flash TR reaches out and SMACKS Ted in the face hard

TR
The only way your frivolous writings and
childish drawings will provide for you is
with the heat they’1l emit when you burn
them for fuel

TR storms out Mac joins Ted who slumps in the booth

MAC
That didn’t look like it went so well

TED
My whole life I’ve done this and I’ve
done that my entire life The only
time he encouraged me or supported me was
when I was doing what he wanted me to do
German classes riflery gymnastics
like my life is an extension of his own
you know

MAC
You’re not him Ted

TED
Maybe he’s right Maybe I should just go
into the bottling business Maybe Geisel
and Geisel is exactly what I should be
doing

MAC
Or maybe this an old friend of mine is
coming up for homecoming When he’s not
lolly-gagging around campus still
pretending to be a student--

TED
Sounds familiar

MAC
-He’s a book publisher in New York
And he’s always mentioning that he wants
to meet my star staffers - why don’t I
drop him a line and tell him even though
I don’t have one maybe he should have
breakfast with you

TED
Now that’s funny

Audrey laughs but takes note of Helen’s demeanor Although
she’s smiling she looks as sad and tired as we’ve seen her

AUDREY
Oh great fun You know Helen’s right

There are some writing samples some
jokes cartoons a one-act I wrote awhile
ago The most recent articles are

Ted chews on a thumbnail - this is torture Finally Marshall
slowly closes the folder and looks up

MARSHALL (CONTD)
(flatly)
I don’t get it

TED
Well you see--

MARSHALL
If I’m being honest this is all over the
place

TED

I realize that and I’ve been thinking of
leveraging my Jacko experience into a
satirical novel maybe Perhaps a coming
of age tale or a--

MARSHALL
Ted you’re a Dartmouth man Have you
considered Wall Street

A beat while Ted stares ahead blankly

TED
Not remotely

MARSHALL
Publishing writing it’s a brutal
business

TED
It’s all I want to do
Marshall considers Ted’s sincerity his desperate tone

MARSHALL
Tell you what I’11 pass some of your
cartoons to our juvenile division see
what they can make of it

TED
Children’s books

MARSHALL
Dick and Jane that sort of thing

TED
(getting pissed now)
That’s absurd

MARSHALL
(regarding the portfolio)
Kind of thought absurd might be right up
your alley

TED
Due respect Mr Marshall but there’s
not a bat’s chance in hell you’ll ever
find me writing kids books

Marshall closes the portfolio and slides it back to Ted
MARSHALL
Suit yourself

What are you doing

TED
To hell with it They’re right I’m not
a writer I’m not an artist I’ma
cheap-shot joker with questionable
drawing skills That’s not a job--

Helen collars Ted and plants his face in the selection of
magazines on a nearby stand Among them is the Jacko

She lines up

Ted softens

HELEN

Look at these

Magazine after magazine sold everywhere
filled with satirical cartoons
editorials articles all full of razor-
sharp wit even the ads Where do you
think all these come from

This is who you are this is what you do

one of Ted’s drawings with an ad for emphasis

HELEN (CONTD)
You do this in your sleep

OFF the side-by-side drawings

HELEN
Id rather freeze to death in New
Hampshire suffering the drunken advances
of horny college boys--

TED
You forgot to say unwanted Drunken
unwanted advances--

HELEN
--than let you work a single day at
anything other than what you love It
should be like that

Ted lets this soak in his funk lifting with every step

AUDREY
I was in the neighborhood
HELEN
Audrey This isn’t necessary Really
AUDREY
Ted mentioned you’ve been prescribed an
extra measure of rest of course it is

It’s the least I can do

Ted mentioned

AUDREY
The other evening I was asking after
you - I’m sorry if--

It’s fine

Helen labors over to the kitchen produces a prescription bottle
and rattles out a giant pill gulping it down with difficulty

HELEN (CONT’D)
I’m fine

Helen returns to her seat by the window Audrey notes the
subdued atmosphere breaks the silence

AUDREY
I’1l just let myself out Please don’t

Audrey emerges from the spiral staircase wonders at the sight
of his studio for the first time

TED (CONTD)

Audrey moves into the room wide-eyed

Pictures of Helen and Ted’s world travels adorn the window

On the walls hang mounted heads of his papier-mache invented
wild game a toucan colored gazelle with a horn an oversized
smiling bird with a curled feather atop his head

Audrey laughs delighted Ted beckons her over

TED (CONTD)

hesitation Audrey heads over to inspect

TED (CONTD)

So these two kids are stuck at home on a

rainy day their mother heads out

TED (CONTD)
And theyve got this imperious
goldfish insisting they behave

AUDREY
Oh he’s cute My kids have a goldfish
or rather had They don’t last long

TED
Then a surprise visitor arrives -
a free-spirited cat in a hat

Ted lays out a sketch of the Cat in the Hat it’s very close to
resembling the final version but the hat is nondescript and the
Cat has no bow tie Audrey’s eyes light up

AUDREY
Oh they’1l love this Ted

TED
Hang on don’t move

AUDREY
What is it

TED

one of four animals A bird a cat a
horse or a pig

You know Judith Morgan right

As Ted and Audrey burst out laughing

INT LA JOLLA HOME -- LIVING ROOM -- SAME

Helen hearing the laughter from the studio pulls herself off
the sofa and over to the stairs

She looks up the menacing tower of stairs as the mumble of
conversation and Audrey’s laughter from above continues She
braces steps winces then makes it up the first step

A little more confident she struggles up the next her body
shaking as she grips the railing and sets her weight down
slowly Sweat beads on her forehead More laughter

As she goes for the third step her legs buckle and she falls to
the floor in a crumpled heap with a THUMP Ted runs out

Ted takes a seat next to TR as his arraignment begins

LAYCOCK (CONTD)
Public drunkenness disturbing the peace
public indecency My inclination Mr
Geisel is to expel you for this and wash
my hands of the whole ordeal

(then)
But your father has made a compelling
argument on your behalf

Ted stares ahead blankly

LAYCOCK (CONTD)

I have decided to allow you to stay on
campus long enough to graduate But you
will remain on probation in the interim
and any hint of an infraction of this
school’s rules or policies academically
or otherwise will result in your
immediate and final dismissal

No reaction from Ted

LAYCOCK (CONTD)

Your father has also suggested and I
agree completely that your days at the
Jack-o-lantern magazine are finished
I’1l inform Professor Maclean of your
removal from the mast and any
contribution bearing your name in this or
any other campus publication will
likewise result in expulsion Are we
clear

(shaking the Dean’s hand)
Yes we are sir Many thanks

I’ve done up here that I’m proud of

TR
I am helping you to clear this blot from
the family name--

TED
The family name the family name
That’s all you care about isn’t it
God-forbid you actually stand up for your
son No the “Geisel family name” is far
more important What a load of crap

TR
I’m trying to help you son

TED
I don’t need your help

TR pulls an envelope from his pocket hands it to Ted

TED (CONTD)
What’s this

TR
I’ve arranged a job for you in New York

The good news is that Helen’s blood work
shows no trace of Guillain Barre

HELEN
Thank God--

DR DAVIS
However the panels we ran do show an
elevated white blood cell count which is
why I brought in Dr Walsh He’s from
oncology

DR WALSH

pathology we dug a little deeper ran
some precautionary tests and this is the
bad news We found more than one
indication that there is a likely
malignancy in at least one lymph node
Cancer

Close on TED The Doctor’s voice fade outs drowned out by the
sounds of his beating heart his breath white noise

DR DAVIS (CONTD)
I’m sure you both have questions - Dr
Walsh will talk through the next steps

checked out Ted releases his grip on her hand and moves to
the window staring out

As Dr Walsh continues only a few words break through the noise
in Teds head

ONCOLOGIST

With an exhale Ted checks turns around checks back in

ONCOLOGIST (CONTD)
The only certainty is that this will be a

will and determination But with the
right attitude miracles can happen

She grabs a handful of mashed potatoes from a passerby’s tray
and volleys it at Ted who ducks just in time

TED
Helen what the hell

The potatoes land square in the chest of a SQUAT LOOKING

Racing across the green Helen stumbles over a GROUNDSKEEPERs
rake bending it beyond repair

GROUNDSKEEPER

Ted finally catches Helen and they both double over out of
breath

TED
Why are you doing this

HELEN
Because you’re in serious need of an un-
slumping

TED

It’s my slump Let me have it to myself

Helen pounces on Ted - exhausted they fall to the ground
Helen removes the hat serious now

HELEN
Hey I can’t even begin to pretend to
understand what you’re going through
But you gotta stop playing this game
with yourself - you can’t win

The lonely guy game

turned down offers from all the Wall
Street shops and tried out for the
majors Long story short - he was signed
by the Boston Red Sox

TED
But then he got cut right If he was so
awful--

MAC

Yeah it was a pretty short career -
twelve games in fact

TED
What’s the point Of any of this--

MAC

Chick Maynard played For those twelve
nights of his life he stood under the
lights and he swung for the fences He
lived his dream And that’s why we love
him

Ted sits up straight and pulls out his portfolio flipping
through it We see glimpses of Yertle the Turtle Gerald
McBoing Boing Sam-I-Am the Grinch Then a blank page
Eyes welling up he puts pencil to paper

transform to Truffala trees the sun glows a vibrant pastel
color the sea foams green and white the houses clinging to the
cliffs - it all morphs into the wonderful world of DR SEUSS
