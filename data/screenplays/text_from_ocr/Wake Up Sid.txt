samunder hi to hai jo nahi badalta hamesha
yahin rahta hai you know

Actually Ayesha tumhe ise barish mei dekhna
chahiye Mam Bombay monsoon one to die for
logh complain karte rahte hai traffic ke bare mei
floods ke bare mei but I just love the monsoons

me

The sea has always been special for Bombay I
guess I can see why This city where everything
keeps changing only the sea does not change you
is always here you know

Actually Ayesha you should see it in the rains
Bombay rains is what people keep complaining
The floods traffic but I love the monsoons
Whenever it rains the sea looks amazing then and
can see it really awesome

Wow I am going to remember that

Ayesha can ask you something

If anything more it left ask it

You are alone in Bombay are you not scared

Are you kidding Siddharth You don’t know how
scared am have never been alone like this You
know what everything will be alright i was drean
to come to Bonibay and now that am here I
cannoi be scared There is so much to be done he-

man not a boy

Basically mere exact opposite

Ask
You and became friends which is great but if
you think we can be something else also you
know more than a friend Then what do you think
why its it not like this
Sid because it is not enough we are friend that’s
enough Sid and don’t think I could fall in love
with someone like you that’s why

Why I mean I am kind of perfect

Yeah

Now seriously Ayesha what is less in me

Its not that anything is less in you Sid I don’t
want to talk about this you will feel bad

Hey why would you feel that don’t love you
Come on think you talk on this

Okay ¢ ith you are stil a kid Sid You are a bit
immature childish and not the one am looking
for

Okay this is going to be fun whom are you
searchiiig for Ayesha

I guess somebody ho is independent for starters
status one who has a definite career has a goal in
life whose ideas meets mine In short a man not a
boy

Basically mere exact opposite

sakogi

Ofcourse kar sakungi Calcutta se itni dur aayi
hun writer hi to banana ke liye Mei aapse bahut
kuch seekh paungi

Writer tum writer banana chahati ho to fhir is
post ke liye kyun apply kiya Ye mere assistant
ka post hai sirf clerical kaam koyi creativity nahi
ho rahi hat Mera table saaf karne mei aur vaise
bhi hamara magazine Bombay ke bare mei hai
aur fhir tum yahan ki ho bhi nahi

Par aap bhi to Bangalore se the jab ye magazine
join kiya tha aur das saal mei iske editor ban
gaye Mei aapke bare mei sab kuch janti hun
Actually meine bahut soch ke is job ke liye
apply kiya hai In fact interview ko dimaag mei

Of course I can do I have come so far from
Calcutta to become a writer I will learn a lot
from you

Writer you want to become a writer then why did
you apply for this post This is my assistant’s post
only clerical work it wont be any creative To
clear my table and anyway our magazine about
Bombay and you are not from Bombay

But you were also from Bangalore when you had
joined this magazine and became editor in ten
years know everything about you Actually
thought a lot before joining this job In fact I have
imagined a thousand time in my mind I had not
thought that would be so nervous and you so

ki aap kisi din mujhe phone karenge aur
vapas ghar bula lenge Par aapne aisa nahi
kiya maine bhi soch liya ki jab tak aap
mujhe khud nahi bulayenge main aapse
milne nahi aaunga Lekin aaj mujhe job mila
gaya hai Ek magazine mein assistant
photographer ki post hai aur mujhe ye job
karna hai Ek mahine se photographs le raha
hu kaam kar raha hu main bahut khush hu
Main janta hu ki photography ke bare mein
maine kabhi baat nahi ki aur hamara family
business bhi hai Lekin pata nahi kyo mujhe
lagta hai ki aap mujhe samajh jayenge Aap
samjhenge kyo ki photography mujhe ap se
hi mult hai Main bhool gaya tha ki
photography aap ki bhi hobby hai kitne
photographs lete the aap Phir kyo bund kar
diya aapne

Tum bade ho gaye beta Tumhare paas mere
photos ke liye waqt hi nahi raha aur mere
liye photography ka matlab tha tumhari

also decided that till you don’t call me I
wont come to meet you But today I have
got a job And the post is of an assistant
photographer in a magazine and want to
do this job am clicking photographs since
one month and am quite happy know
that I have never talked about the
photography and its out family business
also But I don’t know why feel that you
would understand me You will understand
because have got photography from you
only had forgotten that photography was
your hobby also you were taking so many
photographs Then why did you stop that

You have grown up son You didn’t have
time for my photographs and for me the
meaning of photographs was to click your
photos

This is my first pay cheque For you

Or my independence what has the city give
to me

Actually the answer was before me since
many days but I only couldnt recognize
As soon as came to Mumbai

The same night met him A boy friend
roommate or companion what ever you say
Quite opposite to me No ambition no goal
in his life But still knew how to enjoy life
was thinking that had he not helped in
making my flat a house Would the nights
have been less lonely if he hadnt come to
share the loneliness at tea time

When came to Mumbai my goals were
clear but now know that I would have
been happy if you share it with some one
Now I know that the love for Mumbai city
s for this friend

Because he only thought me the rules of
love Mumbai is as strict as it is beautiful
While running behind the goal

Our sight gets distraced by many things

Ek pal ke liye apni ankhe bund kijiye

MS Ayesha standing on the sea shore

Aur apne special some one ko dhoodhiye Is
sheher ko uski nazro se dekhiye aur aapki
Mumbai aapko aur bhi khoobsurat nazar
aayegi
