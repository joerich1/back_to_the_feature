1 INT UNIVERSITY LECTURE HALL - DAY
A GIRLS FACE
fills the screen twenty-one years old pensive pretty

Camera lingers on her in CLOSE UP noticing details hair
worn stylishly messy no makeup double-pierced ears (though
no earrings today) the corner of her bottom lip a little
frayed where shes been chewing it ruminatively

Shes the kind of beauty who can withstand such bad lighting
institutional lighting florescents HUMMING overhead joining
the chorus of ambient noises a COUGH papers RUSTLING the
SCRIBBLE of a pen someone SHIFTING in their chair etc The
shot lingers until it becomes uncomfortable invasive
scrutinizing this unhappy girl in an unguarded moment then -

A new sound breaks her reverie a muted BUZZING os and her
eyes cut down to -

HER CELLPHONE

skittering sideways across the closed cover of her blue final
exam book like a bug She has an INCOMING TEXT MESSAGE

WIDEN TO REVEAL

2 INT UNIVERSITY LECTURE HALL - ESTABLISHING - DAY
Our GIRL is just one of two hundred other STUDENTS filling a
big auditorium-style lecture hall Around her classmates

off the edge of the half-desk looks at the display

Theres a collective GROAN and the sound of two hundred
panicked asses twisting in their seats

Our girl feels her phone buzz looks down to see a final text
message from her friend

A slow smile lights up her face at the idea as all around
her students rise and begin stampeding out

PROCTOR (0S) (contd)

She gathers her things begins to make her way down the
stairs when -

GIRL

She hands in her exam book waves to her friend and exits

EXT NEW ENGLAND UNIVERSITY - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

Campus is a ghost town most students having already left for
the holidays the DORMS abandoned the LIBRARY STACKS empty
the LABS silent the DINING HALLS eerie

Our GIRL hurries across the deserted college green dotted
with little hillocks of snow from an earlier storm She
passes a forlorn pine tree decorated with CHRISTMAS LIGHTS
on her way to

EXT UNIVERSITY - QUAD - DAY

She arrives at a large partially-enclosed KIOSK covered with
dozens of student-made notices printed in a rainbow of eye-
catching computer fonts and colors A sign at the top reads
RIDE BOARD

She scans the posted notices One catches her eye torn

hastily from a spiral notebook on which is scrawled a
handwritten message

Call 607-154-9835
A gust of wind riffles the notice

EXT UNIVERSITY - STUDENT PARKING LOT - DAY

Our girl wheels her suitcase across a largely-empty parking
lot Its late afternoon and already dark enough for the
sodium vapor streetlights to have come on A few snowflakes
swirl in their sickbed glow

We follow her to

A beat-to-shit 1988 OLDSMOBILE idling in the middle of the
lot An unbroken dusting of snow indicates its been the
only vehicle here for some time

An underclassman GUY 19 is asleep behind the wheel of the
Oldsmobile Hes skinny dressed in thrift-shop clothes has
the complexion of someone who doesnt get out in the sun
much His car is filled with all of his earthly possessions
books CDs in plastic milk crates dirty laundry etc

She knocks on the drivers side window startling him awake
He stirs blinks uncomprehendingly at the empty parking lot

GIRL
Do you think you could have parked
any further from the entrance

The sight of her quickly snaps him awake He scrambles out

GUY
(still a little groggy)
There were still cars when I got

She climbs in tries to power her window all the way to the

A florescent oasis in the gathering dark A tow truck and
several old wrecks rusting in the weeds surrounding it

The Oldsmobile pulls off the highway and up to a gas pump

EXT PENN-WAY QUICK MART - GAS PUMP OLDSMOBILE - MINUTES

LATER
He starts the pump Notices her still seated in the car
He knocks on her window She opens the door

GUY
I thought you had to pee

GIRL
I didnt expect us to finda

He looks over the roof of the car sizing up the distance
across the slushy parking lot

GUY (contd)
Well if you want I can carry you

GIRL
Thats okay theyll be dry in just

GUY

GIRL
You are not carrying me inside

He opens her door pulls her legs around and crouches down
between them

GUY
Hold on

GIRL
What are you doing Wait -

WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 22305 15

Suddenly hes rising and she throws her arms instinctively

around his neck

Unsettling as the deeply-weird moment is she decides its
best to just humor him But first -

GIRL (contd)
I need my purse

He crouches a little so she can reach to retrieve it

INT PENN-WAY QUICK MART - NIGHT

The door JINGLES as he enters carrying her His face is red
from effort hers from embarrassment

GIRL
Thanks
GUY
Sure
He just stands there She taps him on the shoulder
GIRL

You can let me down now

GUY
Okay

He crouches so she can slide off She gives him a look
slips on the pair of flip-flops shes brought with her then
heads off in search of the ladies bathroom

Meanwhile our guy saunters up toward the front of the

convenience store He nods to the twitchy CLERK 20s
engrossed in a tattoo fetish magazine behind the counter

INT PENN-WAY QUICK MART - BATHROOM - THAT MOMENT

The toilet is gross tiled a queasy green graffiti-covered

Our girl finishes peeing gets up from the toilet uses her
foot to flush and her elbow to turn on the faucet She
washes her hands holding them under the automatic dryer

Broken

She wipes her hands dry on her jeans Is about to exit when
she catches sight of her reflection in the dirty mirror

WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 22305 16

On impulse she takes out her glasses from her purse Slips

them on Checks herself out in the mirror
Cool Sexy

With her glasses on she notices something scratched into the
dirty mirror

CLOSE ON MIRROR
Where we see
JCR 12-24-88 RIP
She frowns slips her glasses back in their case and moves to
exit But when she grips the doorknob she finds it LOCKED

She frowns Rattles the doorknob a few times

A look of panic crosses her face and she starts rattling the
doorknob harder Did someone lock her in

Suddenly the doorknob comes off in her hand
She pounds on the door with the heel of her palm shouts

GIRL
HEY HEY IM LOCKED IN HERE

Nothing
She turns scanning the filthy bathroom notices something
HER POV

A VENT above the sink near the ceiling

BACK TO SCENE

She puts a foot up into the sink testing it to see if it can
take her weight Then climbs up and straightens on wobbly
legs until her face is near the filthy dust-clogged vent

GIRL (contd)
(calling into vent)
HEY CAN ANYBODY HEAR ME HEY

Her voice ECHOES weirdly When the echoes die down she hears
something from the vent that makes her scowl LAUGHTER As if
our guy and the clerk are having a good laugh at her expense
Pissed off now she climbs back down and attacks the broken
doorknob with renewed urgency

WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 22305 17

And finally succeeds in getting the door to open

INT PENN-WAY QUICK MART - OUTSIDE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

As she exits she sees the CLERK and our guy talking quietly
as if they know one another She hesitates for a second
spying on them around a display of chips Suspicious

AT THE COUNTER

She strides up as the guy pays for the gas and a couple
bottles of water

GIRL
Didnt you hear me banging in
there
GUY
(startled puzzled smile)

GUY

Since when are they friends
They separate walking around to their respective sides of

the car She tries the passenger door handle only to find
it stuck

WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 22305 19

She rolls her eyes waits for him to open it from the inside

OMITTED

INT OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT

She stares out at the road ahead lulled by the sound of the
windshield wipers sweeping snowflakes from side to side

HER POV

A nondescript exit comes up fast for a side road Which
wouldnt be cause for alarm or even interest except-

He suddenly turns the wheel sharply taking the exit

EXT OLDSMOBILE - THAT MOMENT

The car veers off the interstate onto a much smaller two-lane
road marked with a simple sign paint-on-wood faded to
illegibility Scenic Route 606

The tires crunch across an old chain which had once prevented
access to the road but is now half-buried in the snow

Attached to it is a diamond-shaped warning sign of a more
modern vintage reading Rough Road

INT OLDSMOBILE - THAT MOMENT

She falls against him bracing herself against the dash

GIRL
What the hell are you doing

GUY
Scenic detour

GIRL
(panicking)
No way Get back on the highway

GUY
Relax I checked it out on the map
It looks interesting

WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 22305 20

GIRL
I mean it get back on the highway
right now This is not going to
happen

He looks a little pissed shes questioning his judgment

GUY
Will you chill Its a shortcut
Well be back on the highway before
you know it

Hard to argue with a shortcut
Nonetheless she glances back with a look of trepidation OUT
THE BACK WINDOW at the highway receding into the distance

EXT SCENIC ROUTE 606 - NIGHT

The Oldsmobile cruises by the only car on the two-lane
scenic highway

As it leaves FRAME camera PANS to the dead grass on the
roadside where it finds a sad little SHRINE half-buried in
the snow two homemade crosses candle stumps a rotting
stuffed bear deflated Mylar balloons

Scrawled on the crosses are

His face is eerie in the green light of the dashboard
He scans the radio dial for something other than static

From a high angle overlooking the road we watch the two cars

EXT STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT

The Oldsmobile has ended up on the opposite roadside facing
the wrong way its drivers side jammed into a snowbank

Snow boils in its headlights

INT STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT

The interior is dark

The girl has been thrown under the dash Its hard to tell

in this light whether shes still breathing
Finally she stirs disoriented

She climbs back into her seat piecing together where she is
It takes her a beat to remember him She looks over slowly

Hes not moving though thanks to his seatbelt hes still
upright behind the wheel His head rests limply against the
drivers window which now looks out on nothing but snowbank

A link of blood trickles down the glass

Dead

Shes not taking any chances Without a sound she slips into
her shoes coat Gropes for her cellphone among the detritus
at her feet

Suddenly he stirs groaning

She freezes

The seconds ticking by on the DASHBOARD CLOCK

When he doesnt wake she resumes fumbling for her cell

Finds it Then eases open the creaky passenger door

And launches herself into the frigid night

EXT STRANDED OLDSMOBILE ROADSIDE - NIGHT

She hurries down the road away from the car Breath clouding
in the frigid air Punches in numbers on her cell phone

INSERT CELLPHONE SCREEN --

WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 22305 26

Shes starting to freak now She hits the REDIAL button

Hes standing right behind her his face in silhouette

C-Calling 9-1-1 Or trying to

He receives this news with a strange calm

GIRL
How can you not have a cell

GUY
(ignoring her)
Howre you doing You all right

GIRL
I yeah Im okay Nothing
broken What about you
GUY

I dont know Think I hit my head

He puts his hand to the left side of his skull and pushes on
it Like someone testing a melon for ripeness

Come to think of it his speech is a little wooden

WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 22305 27

She watches as he turns and takes a few aimless steps away

GUY (contd)
What happened to the uh the guy

GIRL
Who

GUY
Asshole who ran us off the road

Shes completely forgotten all about the other vehicle until
now She turns to look puzzled

Theres no sign of the other vehicle anywhere Theyre alone

GIRL
I dont know I guess maybe he
decided just to hit and run

GUY
So where are his tire tracks

She looks sees an unbroken expanse of fresh white snow

GIRL
In case you havent noticed its
coming down pretty hard

GUY
(points)
Yeah but you can still see our
tracks

The mystery of the missing tracks seems to have penetrated
his post-accident fog bringing him back into sharper focus

She watches as he walks out in front of the Olds headlights
to the middle of the road where the other vehicles tracks
should be

GUY (contd)
What the hell

He walks back to the Olds and opens the passenger door (the
only access into or out of the stranded car thanks to the
snowbank) He begins searching the glove compartment for a

flashlight

WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 22305 28

ANGLE ON HER

Deliberating whether to seize this moment of distraction to
make a break for it

She looks back down the long dark road
Looks back at him bent over rummaging in the Oldsmobile
Too risky

Curiosity getting the better of her she walks out to the
middle of the road to have a look for herself

No tracks
Just an expanse of fresh powder and a few of his footprints
GIRL
(to herself)

This doesnt make any sense

At that moment he emerges from the car with a flashlight He
spokes it sweeps the strong beam over their surroundings

The left side of the road falls off into a darkness so deep
even the flashlights beam cant penetrate it A precipice

He cups his hand and calls out at the top of his lungs
GUY

(calling)
HELLO

She jumps at the sound of his voice her nerves frazzled
GUY (contd)

(calling)
ANYBODY OUT THERE ANYONE HEY

His voice is swallowed by the dark After the echoes subside
the only sound in the hush is the SIZZLE of falling snow and
a weird otherworldly HUM

He snaps off his flashlight thrusts it into his coat pocket

GIRL
What now

WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 22305 29

GUY
I guess we see how bad were stuck

They trudge back to the car boots crunching in the snow

GUY (contd)
You steer Ill push

He holds the passenger door for her while she scrambles in
scooting over into the drivers seat He leaves the door
open so they can communicate

He walks back to the rear of the stranded Oldsmobile
Hes pulling on gloves when something half-buried in the snow

nearby catches his eye He takes out the flashlight shines
it at the roadside

Little wooden crosses

Just two this time Another sad shrine to a different set
of anonymous victims of Route 606

Their proximity to the stranded Olds obviously unsettles him
GIRL
(calling)
Ready

He bends with a little wince and braces his shoulder against
the rear bumper

GUY
(calling)
Ready

The tail lights come on as she turns the ignition He hears

He puts everything hes got into pushing but its no use

Suddenly his face contorts in pain and he clutches his side
He drops out of view disappearing in a cloud of red exhaust

A beat later he pulls himself up pounds on the trunk

GUY (contd)
Stop

The tires stop spinning

hears the crunch-crunch-crunch of his approaching footsteps

In that moment she makes a decision

He arrives at the passenger side door handle just as the
power locks all go THUNK
Hes locked out

You wanna pop the locks
When theres no response from her he puts his lips to the
half-inch gap at the top of the stuck window
GUY (contd)
You gonna unlock the door or what
She sees him cup his hands and peering in through the window

He straightens exasperated puts a hand to his injured head

She looks at him standing there hugging himself against the
sub-zero cold his teeth chattering He doesnt look like an
ax-murderer

She doesnt know what to do Theres a long beat Finally
he throws up his hands in disgust decides to go to Plan B

He looks in at her one last time exits

She listens to the crunch of his footsteps until she cant
hear them anymore

Suddenly theres a loud BANG against the passenger side
window She jumps

GUY
BUT ITS MY CAR

He goes crazy on the stranded Olds punching the roof
jerking the door handle kicking the door screaming at her
the whole time

She cowers inside scared to death

Finally he gives up and with a final BANG to the roof
exits

He turns and heads back down the road

We watch through the rear window as he trudges robotically
away his boots crunch-crunch-crunching in the snow

He stops Leans his weight against a tree Looks back at
the car

Whatever it is hes doing hes clearly not walking to the
gas station
He straightens and continues on until hes out of sight

to see her breath

But shes too busy searching through the junk in the back
seat to notice

Finally she finds what shes looking for silver DUCT TAPE
Also a PAIR OF SCISSORS

She holds the scissors like a dagger clearly thinking they
could come in useful if she needs to defend herself

She climbs up front rips off a three-foot length of tape

She glimpses MOVEMENT outside the passenger window
She gasps ducking out of sight below the cars dashboard
She doesnt move listening her eyes bright with fear

After a long beat she risks a peek over the steering wheel

The windshield is fogged so she wipes a peephole in the
condensate Its too dark to see much beyond the cars hood

She reaches shaking fingers toward the steering column
Flicks on the headlights

A STRANGER is walking away down the middle of the dark road
She screams reaches instinctively to check the power locks

The stranger a black man dressed in a dirty suit walks with
hunched shoulders Snow swirling around him in the darkness

Who the hell takes a stroll in the middle of a snowstorm

Over her initial shock now she reaches for the door handle

EXT ROUTE 606 - ROADSIDE - NIGHT

She gets out of the car clutching the SCISSORS in both hands
like a dagger She stands behind the protection of the open
car door and calls out to the stranger moving down the middle

of the snowy road a dozen yards ahead
Theres a weird HUMMING noise in the air she cant place

GIRL
Hey

No reaction from the stranger

GIRL (contd)
Hello Do you live around here

Again nothing Maybe hes deaf

She moves out from behind the safety of the car door and
starts after the stranger keeping her distance as she calls

The strangers dapper suit is more than dishevelled Its
soaking wet caked in motor oil or some other dark slime

GIRL (contd)
inda crappy night for a walk
dont you think

And theres something definitely off about his shuffling
Its like hes crippled or injured In fact he seems to be
CRYING (Or is it moaning)

GIRL (contd)
Hey wait

But the stranger just keeps shuffling toward the shoulder of
the road headed in the direction of the DARK STAND OF TREES
beyond Soon he moves beyond the reach of the headlights and
disappears into the gloom

GIRL (contd)
What the hell -

Spooked she begins to back toward the stranded Oldsmobile
Backs into -

woods where the stranger disappeared as if not sure which is
the greater threat

pulls the door shut after him Leaving her there in the

HOLD on her as she weighs her options stay out here and
freeze Or risk seeking shelter with a stalker

Eyeing him warily
He starts to reach toward her and she brandishes the scissors-

With the interior light off the car fills with an otherwordly
blue glow reflected off the snow She pulls her knees up as
if trying to make herself as small as she can to position
herself as far away from him as is humanly possible on a

Her eyes cut to the DASHBOARD CLOCK She frowns

Suddenly she notices a trickle of blood coming from his head

GIRL

Youre bleeding

He touches two fingers to the left side of his head They
come away bloody As he lifts his watch cap we see the left
side of his head is matted with frozen blood now beginning
to melt The collar of his coat is soaked with it

among the seatbelts lost nickels and dimes lint

She strips down to bra and panties as demurely as possible
Puts on his insulated underwear and the rest of their things

He slips on his woefully inadequate shirts and pants Its
obvious he gave the warmest stuff to her Also that he took
the backseat because its more cramped than the front

Once theyre finished dressing he reaches up switches off

watching their breath plume in the cold air Note from this
point on their breath will always be visible in the car

He hears her sigh restless

Nothing much they can do about it They fall silent again

They lie in silence for another beat as she tries every
position possible to get comfortable Finally she sits up

intending to go outside He winces when she puts a hand on

howling wind and moves off as far as she dares from the car

She fumbles with the buttons and zippers of her multiple
layers turns her back to the car squats to pee

Her teeth chatter as she does her business one wary eye
peeled to catch the guy peeking

Suddenly out of the gloom appears -
A DARK FIGURE moving by very near her

She GASPS Tumbles back onto her ass As shes struggling
to pull up her pants -

MORE DARK FIGURES appear moving in the same direction

As the figures enter the woods their leader turns so she
glimpses his face elderly and unremarkable at first glance
then for an instant CHANGING into a twisted ashen deathmask

Her SCREAM brings our guy BOLTING out of the car

What What happened

But it all happened so fast she doesnt believe her eyes
She gestures at the procession of DARK FIGURES disappearing
ahead

Why didnt you stop them Maybe
they have a phone

He eases the door shut carefully so it doesnt latch and
accidentally lock them out

The he starts off running after the figures Scared as she
is she decides to follow rather than remain at the car by
herself

EXT ROUTE 606 - FURTHER DOWN ROAD TOP OF A RAVINE - NIGHT 51

The two kids arrive at the place on the road -- top of a
ravine disappearing thirty feet below -- where the dark
figures seemed to be headed

Only to find NO ONE THERE

Whered they go

She looks where hes pointing with the flashlight-

On the wooded slope on the opposite slope of the ravine are
SEVERAL TALL OLD MEN IN DARK COATS dispersing through the
woods As if whatever somber occasion that brought them to
the ravine has ended

Climbing down into the ravine seems too treacherous so the

kids are forced to backtrack to a place several yards away
where they can follow the DARK FIGURES into the

She trudges on ahead her footsteps growing FAINTER finally
fading entirely

Hes alone now
He leans against a tree to catch his breath wincing in pain
For an instant it seems like hes going to be sick But then
he just hocks up phlegm and spits into the pure white snow
Blood
Though still winded he pushes on

A few minutes later he trudges into view Looks around No
sign of our girl

Hello Hello

He arrives at the top of the hill Silhouetted against the
night sky Treeless

His flashlight finds the few vertical objects still standing

A RUINED BUILDING

Windowless and long-abandoned its ceiling and walls caved in
around a large stone chimney

He crunches inside and examines the black maw of the large
stone fireplace now stuffed with trash and dead leaves His
flashlight beam finds a SMALL IRON DOOR built into the side
of the chimney

WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 22305 52

A FIREBOX

He kneels in the snow and tugs the little iron door open
Gingerly slips his arm inside the firebox

Retrieves a bunch of OLD NEWSPAPERS He stuffs them inside
the front of his jacket Continues rummaging around in the
firebox

As he rises he winces in pain one hand going to his side
He takes slow breaths until the pain subsides

He turns in a slow circle His flashlight sweeps over the
interior of the abandoned ruins the beam picking out what
look like branches -

HUMAN HANDS

frozen into claws reaching from

A FROZEN BODY

Its lying on the bare springs of a metal bedframe teeth
clenched in a terrible rictus icicles dripping from nose
clawlike fingers eyes

Hes so startled he nearly drops the flashlight

The wayward light finding ANOTHER FROZEN CORPSE in a nearby
bed mere feet away another rictus grimace clawlike fingers

seeming to reach for him And then another And another

All OLD MEN
Frozen in their death throes like the bodies from Pompeii
ONE OF THE BEDS is EMPTY

Our guy sweeps the flashlight beam to the side and finds the
beds occupant frozen sitting upright in an old wooden
wheelchair

Eye to eye with him

He reels in horror trips LOSES THE FLASHLIGHT as he goes

sprawling Then recovers snatching the flashlight up again
and sweeping it back in the direction of the frozen bodies -

And sees NOTHING No beds No old men

Its the black STRANGER from earlier shuffling and mumbling
This time hes close enough for her to make out some of the
words hes muttering
STRANGER
-please officer please dont

GIRL
Wait

Determined not to let him vanish again she takes off in
pursuit coming alongside him and keeping pace as he shuffles

down the middle of the road

STRANGER
dont put me in the river

Suddenly she glances down sees why hes shuffling so oddly

His ankles above his sodden dress shoes are bound with BALING
WIRE as are his wrists

GIRL
(shocked)
Oh my god Who did this to you

STRANGER

-please officer just take the

booze and let me go
She reaches toward him
The instant her hand nears him the wind HOWLS DEAFENINGLY
She experiences a sudden powerful JOLT almost as if shes
grabbed a live wire only instead of electric heat she
feels a terrible otherwordly cold
Frostbite
The jolt stuns the stranger out of his daze and for the
first time he becomes aware of her He raises his frightened
eyes to her slowly and in doing so reveals his face
A scream builds in her throat at sight of him

The strangers face is bloodless bloated swollen with rot

A sludgy gargling noise comes from his throat and his mouth
moves as if hes trying to speak

But instead of words emerging his throat suddenly bulges
Somethings in there fighting its way up his esophagus

WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 22305 54

She watches in horror as it emerges blind and wriggling like
a blood-fattened leech Forcing its way out through his lips
to land at his feet with a wet PLOP

A river eel

She SCREAMS

She cranks down the icy passenger side window revealing the
silhouette of a HIGHWAY PATROLMAN standing just outside 40s
wearing a trim-fitting uniform and a stiff-brimmed troopers
hat

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN

The kids speak over one another in their relief to see him

He turns to her says in an angry whisper -

But shes already digging cash out of her purse

He looks at her in disbelief Sees that shes serious He

back in the direction of the Olds

She holds out the money but he ignores it

He takes off his hat so he can mop his brow As he turns
she gets a first good look at his face handsome but hard
with cruel snake charmers eyes looking back at her

She startles as if slapped too horrified to parse his
meaning

She continues backing away until shes backed up against the
trunk of the Olds

GIRL
No

The cop is advancing toward her when suddenly he catches
sight of something high on the hillside behind her that makes
him stop

She glances over her shoulder to see what hes looking at

A LIGHT on the hilltop where the burned-out ruins stand
And weirder still theres a FIGURE in silhouette standing
nearby

Someone watching

The cop darkens enraged by this unwanted audience His face
contorts fury building in him until he trembles with it He
rests his hand on the butt of his service revolver says to

her in a low urgent voice

Get in the damn patrol car

She starts walking toward the parked patrol car ahead of him
The highway patrolmans boots CRUNCHING behind her

Suddenly the guy appears brandishing a CROWBAR
He swings it in a lethal arc toward the patrolmans head

The cops head crumples inward The cops expression of FURY
suddenly STUTTERS like film slipping in the projector -

She fights her own gag reflex as she pulls the crowbar free
It comes away with several long black strips of dead skin

The pain is so bad it brings tears to his eyes His teeth

forcing his thick hairy thumb between her lips and making her

-- POV underneath his patrol car as his boots kick her feet
apart and take up position between them

-- The brim of his hat lifting to reveal him looking up with

sight of --

-- SILHOUETTES of old men watching on the hilltop roused by
the commotion down on the road below --

elemental force like the storm itself Skittering along the

opening and closing the interior light flickering the

sweeping back and forth etc

along the undercarriage of the car

even breathe

blown assault

Theres the shriek of RENDING METAL the thing outside begins
HAMMERING at the cars hood doors etc

around like plastic flakes in a snow globe

The radio snaps back on the saxophone solo in the Brenda Lee
song accompanying the violent CLANGS and GROANS of metal
being torn asunder as the thing under the car rips away
muffler brake lines wrenches the handles from the doors
etc

Leaving them sitting there in the dark in stunned silence

telephone pole looks much higher than it did from the car
And the iron rungs look a lot narrower too

Shes losing her nerve

She glances back to check no police lights are coming

Steels herself

Then puts her foot on the first rung and hauls herself up

INT STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - THAT MOMENT

CLOSE ON THE RADIO where between increasingly long snatches
of STATIC we can just discern Gene Autrys version of Here
Comes Santa Claus

EXT ROADSIDE TELEPHONE POLE - AS BEFORE

The rungs are icy forcing her to climb slower than she would
like She keeps her eyes forward never once looking down
When the wind gusts she pauses and waits for it to subside
Shes midway to the top when her foot SLIPS on an icy rung
She clutches the pole tightly wind whistling in her ears
She waits until her heart slows and shes recovered from her
near fall

Then looks up to gauge the distance left to the JUNCTION BOX

Keeps climbing

She reaches the last rung at the TOP OF THE TELEPHONE POLE

Its noisy up here thanks to the WIND and the icy telephone
wires source of the mysterious HUMMING shes been hearing

She tries the little metal door of the grey JUNCTION BOX
Locked

GIRL
No
She fumbles in her coat takes out the SCISSORS uses them to
try and pry open the junction box (which turns out to be

frozen shut not locked after all)

It finally yields opening

Revealing a rats nest of multicolored WIRES and PHONE JACKS

Hurrying now she tugs her glove off with her teeth and with
her bare hand retrieves the cord-wrapped RECEIVER from inside
her sweater In her effort to juggle all these items she
loses her grip on the SCISSORS

Which drop all the way down to disappear in the snow below

She concentrates now on the receiver But her fingers are so
clumsy from the cold she fumbles it

And the receiver FALLS too

Then jerks to a STOP a few feet below as it reaches the limit
of its cord

Which shes managed to catch She winds the receiver up by
its cord finally plugs the jack-end into the junction box

Hears a DIAL TONE

Hello Hello

The connection SPARKS and she feels a small shock that makes
her drop the phone When she retrieves it and holds it back
to her ear the line is DEAD

No way of knowing if her message got through
Its a moment of such soul-crushing despair she shuts her

eyes and leans her head against the pole as if wanting to
just quietly die up here thirty feet above the earth

INT STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - THAT MOMENT

CLOSE ON THE RADIO playing nothing but STATIC now

EXT ROADSIDE TELEPHONE POLE - AS BEFORE

Her eyes open and she commences climbing back down to earth
She reaches the second set of rungs from the bottom and drops
the last several feet The snow does little to cushion her

fall and she goes sprawling lays there for a dazed moment

She starts crawling on all fours back toward the stranded
Olds Suddenly she stops as she comes upon-

A WOMANS BARE FEET
standing in the snow veins visible through gravid skin

A thick spatter of mud lands on the bare foot

Our girl raises her eyes to see -

A DEAD WOMAN

Its the blonde we saw raped and murdered in the summer of
1958 Her dress is in tattered ruins coated in leaves and
dirt like someone recently exhumed from a shallow grave
Her head is twisted at an unnatural angle on a broken neck
Our girl GASPS and scrambles to her feet fleeing

Only to stop dead in her tracks as she nearly collides with-

TWO DEAD TEENAGE BOYS

WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 22305 85

The joyriding teens killed on Christmas Eve 1958

Both wear blood-soaked letterman jackets bearing the
DISTINCTIVE COUGAR INSIGNIA and stand in a post-accident
haze

Ones chest is concave stove-in by the impact with the
steering wheel The others teeth are visible where his
cheek has been torn away

She reels away in horror forced to take the long way back to
the Oldsmobile She runs the last few yards to the car where

we can hear the eerie sound of STATIC emanating from the
radio as she hurls herself -

INT STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT

Inside Safe
She sits there out of breath She glances over quickly at
our guy gravely pale slumped unconscious behind the

steering wheel

She chafes her hands to get the circulation going again

She turns down the volume on the radio

GIRL
(chattering teeth)
- I did it - got through - but I
dont know how much she understood -
the operator mean —

He doesnt respond
GIRL (contd)

- Just have to hope - maybe - they
can trace the line -

When this too gets no response from him she looks over
frowning She scoots a little closer across the front seat
toward him

Which is when WE SEE -

HIS GHOST

standing outside the car slack-expressioned and staring

He stands there a beat then drifts off into the night

WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 22305 86

GIRL (contd)
Hang in there cant be much
longer
She reaches to jostle him awake One touch confirms her

worst fears

She reaches up to switch on the INTERIOR LIGHT to get a
better look at him

GIRL (contd)
Oh god

Her reaction is so sudden and violent and overwhelming it
seems for a moment shes going to be sick She covers her
mouth muffling a cry of raw-throated terror

Then shakes him again harder this time desperate to wake
him

GIRL (contd)
No Please Dont leave me alone

Tears spill down her cheeks as she fights hysteria She
shakes him harder His inert body spills to one side
slumping against her

Her grief turns to something else instinctive and immediate
revulsion at the feel of his cold dead weight against her

She scrambles across the front seat to put as much distance
as she can between herself and the corpse

Cowers against the passenger door

The INTERIOR LIGHT flickers out as the battery finally dies

EXT STRANDED OLDSMOBILE ROADSIDE - MOMENTS LATER

The door opens and she backs out hauling the dead body after
her Her face is red tear-streaked

GIRL
(crying)
Sorry sorry Im sorry

She strains to move his dead weight Her feet slip on the
ice and she lets go of him catching herself on the open
door

WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 22305 87

She grabs the body under the armpits hauls with all her
strength Drags him a few yards away from the Oldsmobile
His boot heels ploughing twin gouges in the snow

Behind her gravity pulls the heavy car door shut with a soft
THUNK
Suddenly her feet go out from under her as she hits a patch
of ice She goes down hard on her ass sprawling Sits
there a beat as-

HEADLIGHTS appear on the dark horizon We see them a split-
second before she does

Hes coming
When she glimpses the oncoming headlights out of the corner
of her eye she turns her head slowly in their direction and

for an instant it almost seems as if they dont register

Then her eyes widen in terror she lets out a small whimper
and leaps into action

She scrambles to her feet and makes a mad dash toward the
Oldsmobile -

Only to find when she tugs on the handle that its STUCK
She yanks on it harder getting frantic now as -

The HEADLIGHTS get brighter bearing down close enough now
that we can hear the ROAR of the oncoming engine

She kicks the handle tugs with all her might rocking the
car but not succeeding in getting the door open

As the headlights become BLINDING
Suddenly theres the sound of BRAKES being engaged and the

headlights slow to a stop just a few yards shy of where shes
standing in the middle of the road

She shields her eyes with an upraised hand
Its a SNOWPLOW
The SNOWPLOW DRIVER 50s sticks his head out the window

Which is playing the same song as Christmas Eve fifty-seven

Despite being pinned upside-down and in pain from injuries
sustained in the accident he chuckles at his predicament
We realize hes been drinking

direction of the snowplow driver and our girl

turn up
