A forest
A dacha

2 INT DACHA- NIGHT 2

JACK (dark fit mid-forties) is staring at the embers of a
log fire He sips from a thick cut crystal glass of whiskey

The impressive US Army Special Forces crest tattooed on the
shoulder of his bare torso is at odds with JACKs quiet
manner and the distinguished silver that flecks his hair and
stubble JACK is no longer young
A creak behind him and his eyes flick over his left shoulder
INGRID is naked With an intimate familiarity she kisses
JACK on the top of his head sits close behind him and wraps
her arms around her lover linking her slender hands across
his upper chest

Her head resting on his shoulder her face beside his INGRID
and JACK watch the fire together in easy silence

EXT WOODS- MORNING 3

INGRID leads JACK through the trees Her coat has a white fur
collar They are fresh-faced and warm from bed

They head towards a vast and frozen lake
JACK senses something in the woods

Beneath the Conifers impenetrable darkness
JACK looks around

Thick snow blankets the world and muffles any sound There is
not the slightest breeze

INGRID
What are you looking for

Her Swedish accent is sing-song

JACK
Nothing

His anxiety is evident
INGRID laughs out loud
INGRID
There are no wolves in the woods so

close to the city

JACK smiles

EXT LAKESIDE- MORNING

They continue through the woods until they reach the
shoreline of the lake
INGRID steps onto the ice

Holds out her hand

A beat

JACK takes INGRIDs hand

Solid as stone the frozen lake takes his weight
They walk out INGRID slipping and laughing

The landscape is magical

JACK begins to relax slipping and swearing
Suddenly he stops

There are footprints in the thin snow going out across the
lake

INGRID
Snow-hare

Beside the Snow-hares prints are those of a man

INGRID
A hunter

JACK studies the two sets of tracks

Those of the Snow-hare are heading out into the lake The
mans prints are heading in the opposite direction towards
the shoreline

JACK spins around in the direction theyve just come from

No one

Then about ten metres inland from the edge of the lake a
low branch dips and a thick rug of snow falls from the
branch

JACK grabs INGRID yanks her towards the cover of the
lakeside trees and pushes her down into the snow

She grunts winded He lies besides her

We hear the CRACK of a bullet- so quiet it might be a bough
snapping under the weight of winter
It isnt

JACK pulls a WALTHER PPKS semi-automatic handgun from the
pocket of his Parka

Cocks it

Waits

Then bobs up and down once

Theres another CRACK from the trees

JACK pinpoints the spot from the drift of BLUE SMOKE almost
invisible in the winter air

Theres someone in the shadows

He rubs snow into his woollen hat edges up until he can just
see over the snow and pumps THREE SHOTS into the dusk under
the trees

We hear a muttering groan and then a sliding sound as if
JACK has just shot a tobogganist

More snow slides off the trees
JACK waits
INGRID gathers her breath but loses her wits

INGRID
You have a gun

JACK keeps his eyes fixed on the trees
INGRID
You have a gun How do you have a
gun Why should you carry such a
weapon
JACK looks at her briefly but makes no reply
She is busy thinking

So is he

INGRID
Jack

He stands up slowly and walks inland towards the corpse that
is just visible now in the shadows beneath the trees

INGRID follows frightened

The MAN is slouched forwards in a drift of snow his body
cushioned in white softness

JACK kicks the sole of his boot Hes dead

INGRID
Jack talk to me

JACK grabs his collar and turns him over
He doesnt recognise him
JACK fumbles at his buttons and rummages in his clothing

In his breast pocket he finds a MILITARY IDENTITY PASS

INGRID
Who is he
JACK
A hunter
INGRID

Hes not dressed like a hunter Why
is he alone Hunters always go in
pairs For safety

Swiftly JACK removes the bolt from the mans rifle and
throws it far into the trees

JACK
Go for help Call the police

INGRID sets off stumbling up the track they have made
through the snow

JACK shoots her just once in the nape of her neck

She twitches in the snow her blood staining the white fur of
her coat collar

From a distance INGRID looks like a shot Snow-hair

JACK approaches her
And steps over her trying not to look down

Trying not to look back

5 EXT DACHA- MORNING

Outside the dacha is another MAN standing by a black
Mercedes-Benz sedan

The second hunter
He is holding an automatic pistol but hes not on alert
JACK fells him easily with a bullet in the ear

He removes the clip from his WALTHER and reloads it

6 INT DACHA- MORNING

JACK packs a few belongings in a holdall

7 EXT DACHA- MORNING

JACK smashes the CB radio in the Mercedes and removes the
distributor cap from the engine burying it deep in the snow

Then he gets into the Saab

And drives off

8 TITLES
Over images of JACK on a ferry to Gotland changing clothes
and vessels for Ystad travelling by road to Trelleborg
catching the night crossing to Travemunde driving to Hamburg
and from Hamburg catching a train to

9 EXT ROME- DAY

At a fast food stand not far from the central train station
a middle-aged man is squirting ketchup on a hotdog

It is Autumn and without the usual mass of Summer tourists
LARRY stands out as an American

JACK does not
JACK
Blending in

LARRY is shocked to see JACK but pretends the hot dog is the
centre of attention

LARRY
Jack What brings you to Rome

JACK
I closed the Stockholm account

LARRY might be older than JACK but he doesnt seem it His
demeanour is sprightly

JACK
But there were complications

Then LARRY turns and walks eating carefully He is not a man
who likes to get his hands dirty

JACK walks beside him
Both men keep a trained eye on their surroundings
JACK
Collateral damage Two shooters

Unidentified A beat And a girl

LARRY takes a bite of his hot dog and casts a sideways look
at JACK

JACK is tired
LARRY
Theres a bar across the street
the LAquila Freshen up Sit
tight Give me two hours

10 INT BAR- DAY 10

JACK washes his face in the cramped bathroom at the back of
the bar

In the background on the stereo The White Stripes cover One
More Cup of Coffee

JACK stares at himself in the mirror He looks exhausted
11 INT BAR- DAY

JACK is sitting at the back of the bar He has a good view of
the whole establishment including the entrance and the door

to the bathrooms
He lights a cigarette
LARRY comes in and sits opposite him
LARRY
(genuinely shocked)
You started smoking again

JACK exhales

JACK
Guess so

LARRY
Since when

JACK
Since now

The WAITER slides over and flicks a cloth at the table

WAITER
Cafe

LARRY
Due

The WAITER disappears
A beat
LARRY puts an ENVELOPE on the table
LARRY
Stockholm account Final
installment
JACK takes the envelope and puts it in an inside pocket

LARRY is about to speak but stops

The WAITER reappears and puts down two cups of coffee
LARRY puts two cubes of sugar in his cup and starts stirring
Then speaks low and fast

LARRY
You cant stay here Jack You
wont see “em coming not in a big
city But you cant go far either
If the gentlemen whose accounts you
closed belonged to Brink Gallazzo
Simenov- any of the first division-
you have four or five hours at most
before every airport train
station bus stop toll booth and
ski lift from Stockholm to Skopje
is under surveillance

JACK smokes

JACK
So

Not a question An acknowledgement that LARRY knows exactly
what hes talking about And JACK is listening

LARRY
So You find a hole- somewhere
nearby- and you crawl into it and
you stay put until I say its safe
to come out

JACKs expression is as immoveable as a cliff face

LARRY
Turn right outside the bar then
second left Via Spinetti Youll
find a silver Citroen C2 with
Chieti plates Check the glove box
and follow the map Castelvecchio
Its a fucking fortress Literally
And as dead as a graveyard Anyone
within a three to five mile radius
youll see ‘em coming

He pushes something across the table A MOBILE PHONE in a
cellophane bag

LARRY
Get there Stay there

LARRY finishes his coffee and dabs at the corners of his
mouth with a napkin

LARRY
Do nothing “till you get my call
INT CAR- DAY 12
JACK gets into a compact Citroen C2 nothing flash

He opens the glove compartment and finds a PLAIN MANILLA
ENVELOPE

Inside the envelope is
-a PASSPORT bearing Jacks photo in the name of Edward Clarke
-a DRIVERS LICENSE in the same name

-and a MAP

EXT AUTOSTRADA- DAY 13

A long tunnel one of the longest in Europe

JACK at the wheel

It seems like night red stripes strip lights shadows

Vast fans suspended from the ceiling shift the traffic fumes

A button of light expanding

as we burst into daylight

EXT ITALIAN LANDSCAPE- DAY 14
Were in another world

JACKS CAR is winding its way up a twisting mountain road
towards

a ramshackle lonely desolate Italian HILLTOP TOWN

The town sits beneath its own castle Medieval towers
gables streets and church bells framed by the snow-capped

mountain peaks beyond
This is not the Italy of EM Forster or of Bella Tuscany
This is the Italy where the Crusaders built their fortresses

The Italy where Sergio Leone conceived of his great Westerns

A CHURCH BELL tolls

EXT CROSS ROADS- DAY 15
JACK stops the car

At the crossroads is a SIGNPOST pointing to the town

The sign reads

CASTELVECCHIO

INT CAR- CONTINUOUS 16
JACK looks at the sign
He looks up at the silent town at the vast stone ramparts

An OLD MAN comes out of a crooked medieval doorway stares at
JACK and disappears into another building

JACK looks at the dead sockets of the windows random beneath
the rotting patchwork of rooves

A DOG barks The WIND hisses The atmosphere is deathly
JACK makes a decision

And drives away

EXT ITALIAN LANDSCAPE- DAY 17
We see JACKS CAR heading away from CASTELVECCHIO

The CAR crosses a spectacular VIADUCT that spans a deep
RAVINE

The drivers window opens

A MOBILE PHONE in a cellophane bag is thrown out

It drops hundreds of feet down the ravine
FADE OUT

FADE IN

EXT CASTEL DEL MONTE MAIN SQUARE- DAY 18

CASTEL DEL MONTE is a well preserved happy looking little
mediaeval town with a handful of tourists

A chunk of time has passed

JACK is sitting on a table outside a small BAR wearing dark
glasses sipping a coffee and reading a guide book He looks
like a tastefully dressed well educated American tourist He
blends in And no one pays him much attention as he finishes

his coffee pays his bill gets up and leaves

We follow JACK as he passes the parapet of the town ramparts
and looks across the spectacular valley

towards the deserted CASTELVECCHIO

EXT CASTEL DEL MONTE OLD TOWN CENTRE- DAY 19

At a leisurely pace JACK passes a row of municipal rubbish
bins just inside the fortified gates to the old town

Hidden well behind the bins we catch sight of JACKs parked
CAR
EXT CASTEL DEL MONTE TOWN SQUARE- DAY 20

Were right in the heart of the mediaeval old town like the
stronghold at the centre of a castle

JACK approaches a small family run bed and breakfast just off
the main square

The sign reads PENSIONE ABRUZZO

INT PENSIONE ABRUZZO- DAY 21

The internal courtyard is refreshingly cool

In the centre of the courtyard is a FOUNTAIN made of marble
shot through with black veins

In the fountain stands an alabaster STATUE OF A GIRL Shes
wearing a toga and holding a clam shell from which the water
falls The water is delivered by a two and quarter millimetre
diameter pipe made of bronze

As JACK crosses the courtyard he glances at the STATUE

He finds it hard to tear his eyes away

INT PENSIONE ABRUZZO JACKS ROOM- DAY 22
A toothbrush in the glass by the sink
The guidebook on the bedside table

Apart for this JACK has avoided unpacking living entirely
out of his holdall for some time

From the holdall JACK produces a pair of Leica 15x56 Geovid
BRF Rangefinding BINOCULARS

Through his casement window he has good view of
CASTELVECCHIO

He sweeps the town in grid formation calm and methodical
This is a routine assessment

JACKs POV apart from the occasional appearance of an old
man woman or dog the dead town across the valley is empty
INT PENSIONE ABRUZZO JACKS ROOM- NIGHT 23

JACK is lying on top of his bed fully clothed and wide
awake

Taped to the inside of the wooden bed frame

is his WALTHER semi-automatic handgun

EXT CASTEL DEL MONTE OLD TOWN CENTRE- DAY 24
Blinding SUN fills frame

JACK is ostensibly photographing the sights the mediaeval
architecture the square the church

EXT CASTEL DEL MONTE CHURCH- DAY 25

The CHURCH is at the top of town A PRIEST dressed in black
surveys the world below him

Locals are going about their business a few scattered
tourists are enjoying their holiday One “tourist catches
the PRIESTs attention

Perhaps its his build Or the fact that hes the only
tourist on his own Or perhaps its the obsessive grid-like
methodology with which JACK photographs the little town

EXT CASTEL DEL MONTE ALLEYWAY- DAY 26

JACK turns casually down one of the towns many narrow
alleyways

The alleyway way bends left and right in a series of blind
corners and dark tunnels the street enclosed by arches
criss-crossed by flying stone buttresses and flanked by
outside stairwells Its a stalkers heaven- or hell-
depending on how dangerous the prey

JACK proceeds along the alleyway until he gets to a
crossroads where FOUR NARROW ALLEYWAYS converge Each
alleyway leads uphill or downhill with varying degrees of
steepness JACK photographs each alleyway

From an upstairs window he can hear the soundtrack of a game
show on television From another alleyway comes the sound of
a barking dog

No dog is visible

Curious JACK turns around walking back the way he came

The sound of barking gets louder

On his right hand side JACK finds a HIDDEN ARCHWAY

The HIDDEN ARCHWAY resembles an archers slit but is big
enough for a gown man to slip through Unlike a window the
“slit is actually just a crack in a triangular convergence
of two separate and slightly overlapping ancient stone walls

The confluence of two stone surfaces makes the narrow gap
between them very very difficult to spot

JACK slips though the HIDDEN ARCHWAY

Inside is a courtyard

INT COURTYARD- DAY 27
Rotting doors lead to abandoned cellars and storerooms

A MONGREL tied to a post is barking savagely his leash
keeping him inches from sinking his bared fangs into JACK

JACK stares at the dog a mysterious creature of fear and
fury

EXT NARROW ALLEYWAY- DAY 28
JACK reappears through the HIDDEN ARCHWAY and slips back into
the narrow alleyway Its like hes materialised from thin
air
He takes 2 PHOTOGRAPHS
-first of the HIDDEN ARCHWAY

-and then of the street sign VIA ROMANA

Just then a MAN on an original 1970s DUCATI turns down the
alleyway and drives towards him

Casually JACK continues walking

The DUCATI gets nearer The MAN ON THE DUCATI is wearing a
black crash helmet with a tinted visor

JACK picks up his pace

The DUCATI is ten metres away

JACKs right hand moves towards his pocket
Five metres

JACKs hand goes in his pocket

Two metres

BANG

JACK drops to his knees
BANG

The DUCATI backfires for a second time

A pause

Still on his knees JACK pretends to tie his right shoe lace

The MAN ON THE DUCATI stops outside an apartment further up
the alleyway gets off his rickety motorbike and removes his
helmet Hes a corpulent ruddy faced Italian man in his late
sixties

He glances at JACK
JACK stands

MAN ON DUCATI
Buon giorno

JACK
Buon giorno

MAN ON DUCATI
Da dove provenite

For an instant the directness of the question catches JACK
out

JACK
America

MAN ON DUCATI
Ah LAmericano

JACK
Si Il Americano

JACKs pronunciation is good but his grammar is a bit rusty
Perhaps hes playing up on this It suits the role of
American tourist

The MAN laughs enthusiastically emphasizing the correct
grammar

MAN ON DUCATI
LAmericano LAmericano

A WOMANS VOICE comes from within the house- loud and angry-
distracting the MAN ON THE DUCATI who screams back
passionately enters his front door and shuts it behind him
with a hearty slam

JACK walks on

29 EXT CASTEL DEL MONTE TOWN SQUARE- DAY
JACK puts some coins in a CIGARETTE MACHINE

The MACHINE takes his money but wont dispense his
cigarettes

He hits the refund button but nothing happens

JACK checks the time

And thumps the machine hard

Footsteps

JACK adjusts his position and checks the time again

VOICE (0S)
Can I help you

The man behind him is reflected in the surface of JACKs
battered ROLEX

JACK

Im no good with machines

JACK turns smiling politely
The PRIEST smiles back

He is dressed in an ill-fitting un-stylish black suit a
black silk stock and a deep Roman collar fraying at the edge
His name is FATHER BENEDETTO He is older than JACK

FATHER BENEDETTO
You are American

This is stated matter-of-factly like a man practising
English

JACK
Si

FATHER BENEDETTO
You speak Italian

JACK
Poco

FATHER BENEDETTO
Va bene You stay at Pensione
Arbruzzo

Also a statement this time with touch of triumph
JACK is disconcerted but doesnt show it

JACK
Not for much longer

FATHER BENEDETTO
On vacation

JACK
Working vacation

This much is true- after a fashion They speak in English
unless otherwise specified

FATHER BENEDETTO
Lavoro Che genere de lavoro

JACK

FATHER BENEDETTO
Va bene Che genere de fotografia

JACK
Pictures of the region
Architecture landscapes

FATHER BENEDETTO

He stands straight and smiles winningly

JACK

For guidebooks magazines

FATHER BENEDETTO
Ah Magazine Which magazine

JACK shows no discomfort

JACK
Actually its a syndicate Lots of
different publications Um Casa

editrice

FATHER BENEDETTO
Va bene So you must share a glass
of wine with me Questa sera This

A beat
JACK is slightly thrown

JACK
Youre very kind but I

FATHER BENEDETTO
Certo You want to know the truth
about Abruzzo A priest sees
everything

30 EXT PAY PHONE CASTEL DEL MONTE- DAY 30
JACK is using the local PAY PHONE

LARRY (VO)
Do you have any idea how long Ive
been trying to reach you What
happened to the cell I gave you

JACK speaks quietly keeping an eye on the town square

JACK
Did I forget to mention my
electromagnetic hypersensitivity

LARRY (VO)
Dont get jumpy on me Jack That
cell was secure

JACK lights a cigarette

LARRY (VO)
Ive got a job Its a custom fit
You dont even have to pull the

trigger

JACK
Whos the client

LARRY (V0O)
Relax She triple checks out Plus

JACK

LARRY (VO)

JACK lights a cigarette

JACK

LARRY (V0O)

shit and made you disappear You

commission plus the first
installment The rest is yours
After this youre free

On JACK

Turning over the word

INT FATHER BENEDETTOS HOUSE- MAGIC HOUR

The SUN is sinking behind the high mountains that overlook
the hilltop town

JACK is wearing an immaculate white linen shirt
Hes sitting in a small walled garden snuggled at the rear of
a crumbling fifteenth century edifice overlooked yet

secluded and trapping the last rays of the sun

FATHER BENEDETTO pours two large glasses of brandy from a

globulous green bottle of ARMAGNAC and sniffs his drink like
a honey bee hovering over a bloom

FATHER BENEDETTO
Que siamo The quality of the
brandy is good the liquor is
smooth and the glass warmed by the
sun

He pronounces warmed war-med His English is sophisticated
but quaint like an out-of-date book

JACK sniffs his drink before he sips it Not like a
connoisseur like a White House taster checking the safety of
a Presidential beverage

FATHER BENEDETTO
(in ENGLISH)
The only good thing to come from
the Francesi everything else

FATHER BENEDETTO grimaces

FATHER BENEDETTO

The French are pezzi di merda
This is not an American discovery
Italians have known this for
centuries In ITALIAN When Rome
called France the province of Gaul
they were just the same Arrogant
sensualists Their cuisine is fussy
and their wine effeminate Only
their brandy is worthy of any
attention

FATHER BENEDETTO looks at JACK

FATHER BENEDETTO
(in ENGLISH)
Forgive me I speak too fast You
study our history

JACK
No

FATHER BENEDETTO looks horrified
FATHER BENEDETTO

You come to Italy to make a guide
book and you dont care about
history

JACK
I take pictures father

A beat
FATHER BENEDETTO
Of course You are American You
think you can escape history You
live for the present

A beat

JACK likes this man His shrewdness is disconcerting but
humane

JACK sips his brandy
JACK

I try to father
EXT LAQUILA- EVENING 32
Suburban sprawl with a mediaeval heart LAQUILA is the
capital of the Abruzzo region and the nearest big town to
Castel del Monte and Castelveccio
Like these two villages LAQUILA is relatively isolated
nestled high up in the Appenine mountains
EXT LAQUILA SHOPPING STREET- EVENING 33
JACK comes out of a SUPERMARKET carrying two bags of
groceries and turns quickly down a dark side street
EXT LAQUILA VIA LAMPEDUSA- EVENING 34
JACK passes a sign for a MODELLING AGENCY Its a small
inconspicuous sign but it catches his eye because its
graphics are subtly lewd and its attached to the buzzer of

what is otherwise a purely residential apartment block

Entering the apartment block is a beautiful twenty four year-
old Italian girl

CLARA

She catches JACKs eye

He walks on

INT CASTEL DEL MONTE PENSIONE ABRUZZO JACKS ROOM- NIGHT 35

The remnants of a simple yet sophisticated meal apple
pecorino cheese honey and walnuts

On his lap top JACK has organised several weeks worth of
PHOTOGRAPHS of CASTEL DEL MONTE into three categories

1 Street plan
2 Exit routescar
3 Exit routesfoot

Now he is cleaning and oiling his WALTHER PPKS

INT PENSIONE ABRUZZO JACKS ROOM- DAY

JACK completes his morning exercises then showers and

dresses His manner is precise and methodical Only a man who

has lived alone for many years can live like this

When his preparations are complete he picks up his
BINOCULARS and studies the nearby town of CASTELVECCHIO
through his medieval casement window

EXT CASTELVECCIO JACKS POV- CONTINUOUS
The dead town has come to life

Theres a MARKET in progress The central piazza is a hive
activity Food local produce clothes and cheap CD stalls

The market has attracted TOURISTS Standing by a phone box
not far from a cheese stall is an attractive WOMAN in dark
glasses Shes rifling through her handbag searching for
something Under her right arm is a rolled up copy of Il
Messaggero

We notice the front page of the Italian daily newspaper has
been folded in half

of

INT PENSIONE ABRUZZO JACKS ROOM- CONTINUOUS 38
JACK lowers his binoculars
Thinks

Decides to proceed with caution

EXT CASTELVECCHIO- DAY 39

Moving through the busy market JACK is also carrying a copy
of Il Messaggero

with the front page folded in half
He approaches the OLD WOMAN running a cheese stall

JACK
Un po di formaggio per favore

OLD WOMAN
Quale Pecorino parmigiano

JACK
Questo

He points

JACK
E un po di pecorino

JACK glances casually around for the WOMAN

Shes sitting outside a CAFE about twenty metres away
chatting on her cellphone

JACK pays for his cheese and approaches the cafe

EXT CASTELVECCHIO CAFE- DAY 40
JACK sits at an empty table next to the WOMAN

She finishes her call in English Shes well spoken As she
replaces the phone in her handbag she knocks the newspaper

off her table

JACK picks it up
WOMAN
Grazie

JACK
Prego Youre welcome

WOMAN
Youre American

JACK
Amidst gathering clouds

The WOMAN speaks quickly purposefully barely looking at
JACK

WOMAN
Youre assuming Im English or
youd never have mentioned the
weather In fact Im Belgian but I
went to boarding school in England
And am quite happy to converse on
all subjects meteorological

Judging by her stilted choice of words this is code

A WAITER comes out and flicks a cloth over the table Its
nearly midday and the sun is hot He speaks with a tired
voice

WAITER
Buon giorno Desidera

Hes addressing the WOMAN

WOMAN
Una spremute di limone Per favore

Her Italian accent is perfect

WAITER
Signore

The WOMAN looks at JACK for the first time studying him
awaiting his answer as if a great deal depended on it

JACK
Una gelata alla fragola Per
favore
The final fail safe
Now they can introduce themselves

JACK
Edward

WOMAN
Mathilde

The identification process over there is nothing more to do
but get down to business- and conversation becomes suddenly
awkward

MATHILDE
Its hot My car has no air
conditioning I asked for it
but
She trails off

JACK
What car did they give you

Her HAZEL eyes flick over the crowd in front of the cafe
She doesnt answer

JACK clears his throat

Then says quietly

JACK
Range

She takes a long time to answer When she does she does so
over the rim of her half-empty coffee cup scanning the crowd
like a cheating wife customarily anxious not to be seen by
her husband

MATHILDE

MATHILDE
As compact as possible

JACK clears his throat

JACK

No such thing Youll have to make
do with a suppressor like everyone
else Itll dampen the decibels
dislocate the sound source and
reduce muzzle flash I cant make
you silent but I can make you
invisible as the Finnish phrase
goes but only as long as youre
prepared to lose some range

JACK scans the crowd

On the other side of the square he spots a YOUNG MAN in his
mid-thirties with short blonde hair and slight sunburn
hovering by a stall Average height slim athletic build
sunglasses stone-washed designer jeans very neatly pressed
with a sharp crease

JACK
Two oclock

MATHILDE
Excuse me

JACK
By the clothes stall Light blue
shirt open at the neck expensive
buff suede shoes Is he with you

The YOUNG MAN has disappeared into the crowd
MATHILDE
I didnt see him In any case Im

alone

A pause
JACKs jaw muscles grind

MATHILDE
I can accept a slight loss of
range

JACK
You want a weapon with the firing
capacity of a submachine gun and
the range of a rifle
MATHILDE
Can you do it
A beat
JACK
Give me a month To trial Then a
week for final adjustments
EXT CASTEL DEL MONTE LANDSCAPE- TWILIGHT 41

The sun is sinking
Its hunting hour

A FALCON hovers on the wind above the town looking for prey

INT CASTEL DEL MONTE PENSIONE ABRUZZO- NIGHT 42

JACK is lying on top of his bed fully clothed but fast
asleep

His eyes roll left and right beneath his lids
Hes dreaming

In his right hand is a book of MEDIEVAL ITALIAN ART and
ARCHITECTURE

Twitching in his sleep JACKs grip on the ART and ARCHITECTURE
BOOK slowly loosens

THUD
As the BOOK hits the floor JACK opens his eyes sits up and

rips the taped WALTHER from beneath the bed pointing it at
the door

Silence

JACKs heart is beating

INT PENSIONE ABRUZZO JACKS ROOM- MORNING 43
JACK is looking through his BINOCULARS
JACKS POV
»O0f a small yellow and blue Italian POST OFFICE VAN heading
up the winding alpine road towards CASTELVECCIO

EXT CASTELVECCHIO- DAY 44
With the market gone the town is once more dead
And provides no cover
JACK parks his car not far from the town square turns off
the engine and gets out
EXT CASTELVECCHIO TOWN SQUARE CAFE- DAY 45
JACK is sitting in the CAFE where he met Mathilde
He is watching the entrance to the local POST OFFICE
He studies his WATCH

Its been an hour and no one has come or gone from the tiny
rural branch of the Poste Italiane

JACK puts the correct amount of change on the table and gets
up

INT CASTELVECCHIO POST OFFICE- DAY 46
The shop is small and dusty

So is the POSTMASTER

JACK
Buon giorno

The POSTMASTER grunts his reply jutting his chin
JACK
Il fermo posta

The POSTMASTER turns to a rack of pigeonholes behind a sack
of mail hanging in a metal frame like an old persons walking
aid From one pigeonhole he draws a bundle of general
delivery envelopes held together by an elastic band Some
have been there for weeks Months even

POSTMASTER

A beat

JACK
Clarke

Deftly like a teller counting through a thick wad of
banknotes he flicks through the mail with thin wasted

fingers

This makes all the difference The POSTMASTER clicks again
disappearing behind the rack of pigeon holes

The PACKAGE is from an Italian PHOTOGRAPHIC SUPPLIERS

JACK

JACK flicks his eyes downwards He has already put his
PASSPORT on the counter

The POSTMASTER scoops it up with bony fingers
Looks from the picture to JACK

JACK bears the scrutiny with a deadly straight face

INT CASTEL DEL MONTE PENSIONE ARBRUZZO- EVENING 47
JACK unwraps the PACKAGE

He removes

-film

-photographic paper

-development fluids

-fixing solutions

Then

-a solid monolythic rectangular receiver made out of a
single piece of lightweight alloy

-a bolt assembly
-a barrel

Only with this final piece is the puzzle complete
Laid out on the floor is a SOCIMI 821 SUB-MACHINE GUN
Without touching it JACK studies the weapon like a
connoisseur looking at the hue of a wine In particular he

notices that the SERIAL NUMBER has been scratched off

Then he moves slowly assembling the weapon with precision
engineered expertise

-inserting the barrel into the front of the receiver and
securing it with the nut

-opening the sidefolding tubular stock and engaging the
buttpad

-snuggling the buttpad to his shoulder

-looking down the barrel

-and slowly squeezing back the finger-grooved TRIGGER as we

INT LAQUILA VIA LAMPEDUSA CLARAS ROOM- NIGHT 48
Our beautiful twenty four year-old Italian girl enters
CLARA

She sits on the edge of the bed whose ageing metal springs
squeak slightly and puts her smoking cigarette in an ashtray
on the bedside table

She kicks off her slip-on shoes
Slips off her panties

Lifts her light cotton dress over her head and lies back on
the bed in one practised motion

JACK sits on the bed beside her
He doesnt look at her

She reaches up to touch JACK as we cut to

EXT CASTEL DEL MONTE PAY PHONE- DAY 49

JACK is scanning the town square with his usual cautiousness

JACK
Your source in Rome

LARRY (VO)
Clean bill of health and no OC
This was a straight favour with a
dollar chaser Jack The guys got
a second cousin in NOCS on the
graft who filched him the Socimi

JACK
I hope you paid below the odds The
more you pay them the more cops

LARRY (VO)
No ones gossiping Jack

JACK watches FATHER BENEDETTO waving at him from the other
side of the square

JACK

EXT TOWN SQUARE- DAY

FATHER BENEDETTO is sitting in his API three-wheeler

This comical and endearing method of rural transportation is
a cross between a moped and a miniature pick-up truck

In the back of the truck are a mass of writhing SNAKES
The API is turning over but it wont start
The bonnet is open JACK is fixing the engine

He gives a signal and FATHER BENEDETTO turns the ignition key
again

This time the engine starts FATHER BENEDETTO claps and
cheers

INT FATHER BENEDETTOS KITCHEN- EVENING

Sixteenth century Sombre wood panelling stained dark with
polish and smoke Two paraffin lamps stand on a huge antique
sideboard their frosted orbs engraved with scenes from the
life of Our Lord

The room is filled with a dining table a massive black
edifice of oak five inches thick with six legs fluted like

the columns of cathedrals

Using antique crockery ancient copper pots and utensils like
old fashioned instruments of torture FATHER BENEDETTO
performs culinary alchemy transforming flesh into meat
dough into bread hard earth nuggets into vegetables

He hums as he cooks Opera arias And Johnny Cash

JACK sips from a glass of wine and watches FATHER BENEDETTO
potter around the wood fired stove The priest has his own
wine which he sips as he works between bouts of humming

INT FATHER BENEDETTOS KITCHEN- EVENING 52

JACK eats a bowl of chilled carrot and sorrel soup in
silence

FATHER BENEDETTO watches him pleased to see his guest so
absorbed

As soon as JACK has finished FATHER BENEDETTO invites him to
help himself from the ancient tureen

Then he bustles over to the stove humming again
JACK eats studying a framed photo of FATHER BENEDETTO with
his arm around a tough corpulent Italian man in his mid-

twenties FABIO

FATHER BENEDETTO returns to the table with a large covered
dish issuing steam into his face

He notices JACKs eye-line

FATHER BENEDETTO
All the sheep in my flock are dear
to me but some are dearer than
most Especially those that have
strayed from the fold

Off JACKs intrigued look FATHER BENEDETTO clarifies

FATHER BENEDETTO
Fabio He is a in ITALIAN car
doctor But I suspect his practice
is not entirely sound Ecco

FATHER BENEDETTO whisks the lid off the covered dish
revealing a stew of poultry carcasses covered in sauce

FATHER BENEDETTO
Fagiano Pheasant With sauce of
orange juice orange peel
chestnuts garlic Marsala wine
and Come si dici in Inglese
Brodo di Pollo Chicken broth

FATHER BENEDETTO serves each of them with a complete
pours white wine into fresh glasses

FATHER BENEDETTO
Also salsify in garlic butter
Mange-tout Fried wild mushrooms
with truffle
JACK helps himself to vegetables
FATHER BENEDETTO watches him as he savours his first

JACK licks his lips and sips some cold white wine

The two men regard one another the priest awaiting a

verdict

JACK
Sinful

FATHER BENEDETTO shrugs

FATHER BENEDETTO
The Holy Father eats better than
this

The flash of a smile crosses the priests face

JACK
Have you ever wanted to be anything
other than a priest

FATHER BENEDETTO
Have you ever wanted to be anything
other than a come se dice in

opposite when we first met

JACK hides his unease from the watchful priest

FATHER BENEDETTO
Journalism cannot make you a rich
man

FATHER BENEDETTOs eyes flick over the ROLEX

JACK
No

FATHER BENEDETTO
Perhaps you are rich already

JACK
Im not a young man I have my
savings

FATHER BENEDETTO
(in ITALIAN)

My meagre income is subject to the
vagaries of the stock market and
with church attendance declining
theres less and less money in the
offertory But if a man has God in
his vaults

He looks searchingly at JACK
JACK
I dont think God is interested in
me Father
FATHER BENEDETTO
(in ENGLISH)
I know better than to try to make a
convert over pheasant and
Trebbiano
JACK is silent
The two men continue eating

Then casually

JACK
What are the snakes for father

FATHER BENEDETTO taps the end of his nose in the universal

sign for secrecy
FATHER BENEDETTO
The grave soul keeps its own
secrets and takes its own
punishment in silence
He has a twinkle in his eye The priest is on a mission to

extract the truth and JACK knows it

EXT OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN- DAY 53
JACK is driving

He checks the rear view mirror
All clear
JACK accelerates the CAR driving it hard at the sidewalk
The vehicle slams into the curb mounting the pavement with a
thump of crunching metal
EXT COUNTRYSIDE- DAY 54
Just east of the old city walls a dirt track meanders
downhill through a series of small holdings allotments and

scrap metal yards

The CAR moves slowly We can hear the scrape of trailing
metal

JACK pulls up beside a high chain fence

The DOGS on the other side start barking This sets off other
dogs in other scrap yards

JACK gets out of the car and approaches a makeshift hut
beside the fence Before hes a metre from the door it opens
and a tough well-built unshaven Italian man in his mid-
twenties looks him up and down

FABIO

JACK
Sono un amico di Padre Benedetto

Suspicion gives way suddenly to warmth

FABIO
LAmericano

JACK smiles politely

JACK
Buon giorno

INT WORKSHOP- DAY 55
The metal door slides open FABIO leads JACK inside

At the back of the cluttered workshop is a blue ALFA ROMEO
being resprayed white Beside it one half of a LANCIA is
being welded to another

JACK knows better than to stare He follows FABIO through

to

INT BACK OFFICE- DAY 56
Girly calendars Italian style

JACK
Im taking pictures forty minutes
north of here Right up in the
mountains Father Benedetto said
you might be able to help

FABIO
(in ITALIAN)
You need models For your
photographs Italian girls

He winks at JACK Hes being friendly
JACK
My publisher wouldnt stretch to a
four by four and the park trails
are playing havoc with my chassis
The technical English is slightly beyond FABIOs grasp
This suits JACK
FABIO

(in ITALIAN)
Want me to take a look
JACK
Not really I just need something
to work on a ruptured driveshaft

FABIO
(in ITALIAN)
Youre a mechanic

JACK
Just a hobby I tinker

JACK looks at the TOOLS hanging on the walls and littering
the work benches

FABIO shrugs

FABIO
(in ITALIAN)
Help yourself In ENGLISH My
garage is your garage

JACK
I appreciate that

FABIO gets on with work sliding himself beneath the

resprayed Alfa Romeo

JACK picks out various implements laying them on the work
surface drill hacksaw lathe vice mallet

Behind an oil pan with a jagged hole in it he discovers
several GEAR WHEELS with the teeth sheared off He holds the
biggest one up

JACK
Bene

FABIO is engrossed his work

FABIO
Si Si Va bene

JACK
Quante

FABIO grins and growls A gearwheel with no bite is useless
to him

FABIO

Niente

JACK wraps the gearwheel in a sheet of oily newspaper and
puts it in the sports bag with the tools

At the door he pauses

Thats when JACK sees it on the notice board A PHOTOGRAPH of
FATHER BENEDETTO and FABIO FABIO is much younger in this
photo fourteen or fifteen years old Hes wearing an AS Roma

THREE CHURCH BELLS ringing large medium and small

As the CLAPPERS hit the SOUNDBOWS we smash cut to

INT JACKS ROOM PENSIONE ABRUZZO- CONTINUOUS 59
JACK has laid out his newly acquired tools on the flag stone

Beside them is the SOCIMI SUB-MACHINE GUN
Using the CHURCH BELLS as sound cover
JACK puts the GEARWHEEL on a flag stone tile and smashes
it into five pieces with a four pound MALLET
INT PENSIONE ABRUZZO- NIGHT 60

By torchlight JACK is fashioning CONNECTORS from the smashed
steel gear

Its very very tricky work and his eyes ache in the poor

This

light

EXT ITALIAN LANDSCAPE- DAY 61

JACK is wearing a knapsack Hes crossing a MEADOW and making
his way towards a RUINED HAMLET His manner is dark
purposeful alert

The grass is long and the trees offer deep shade JACK stops
Everywhere there is a profusion of wild flowers

His guardedness begins to evaporate He has never seen
anything so beautiful or utterly uncorrupted He looks
around transfixed by delicate yellows and mauves brash
whites harsh and brilliant crimsons exquisite blues The
air is humming with insects bees and butterflies

JACK is transfixed

EXT RUINED HAMLET- DAY 62

JACK scrambles up towards the abandoned houses sweating in
the heat

His original cautiousness has returned Carefully he checks
the area for signs of recent disturbance From the foot of
the deserted hamlet he surveys the VALLEY with binoculars
monitoring every square on an imaginary grid for human
activity Satisfied that hes alone he takes a deep breath
of mountain air

And scrambles back down to the valley

EXT WOODS- DAY 63

JACK has parked his CITROEN in the shade of a squat but ample
WALNUT TREE In the near distance is a LAKE

JACK crunches over half-formed walnuts until he reaches a
patch of soft grass beside the water

he decides is the perfect spot He unrolls a blanket

kneels and from his KNAPSACK he produces

-a polystyrene cool box packed with ice and containing a
chilled bottle of Frascati
-a loaf of course bread

-50 gms of pecorino

-100 gms of proscuitto

-a small jar of black olives
-an orange

-and a rolled blanket containing the disassembled parts of
the SOCIMI SUBMACHINE GUN

JACK sets the stopwatch on his weather beaten ROLEX

It takes approximately thirty-four seconds to assemble the
bastardised SOCIMI- including TELESCOPIC SIGHTS and SOUND
SUPPRESSOR- and a further six seconds to press TEN ROUNDS
into the magazine slot it into the base of the hand grip
snuggle the butt to his shoulder and place his eye beside the
rubber cup on the sight

Hes fast

Carefully he surveys the lake Settles on a CLUMP OF REEDS
And with the focus and dexterity of a surgeon concentrates
until his grip and aim are perfectly tense and still

A beat

as JACK holds his breath Then squeezes the trigger
CHOOP

CHOOP

CHOOP

Not the conventional phut phut phut of a movie silencer
but the genuine dampened sonic boom of a TAC 65 sound

suppressor

Through the sight we see the water churn at four oclock to
the REED CLUMP and four metres off

From the knapsack JACK takes a watchmakers steel-handled
screwdriver and adjusts the sight then loads another ten
rounds in the magazine

CHOOP CHOOP CHOOP

The reeds are clipped the bullets slapping into the bank
behind mud spurting

JACK adjusts again and reloads
CHOOP-CHOOP-CHOOP-CHOOP-CHOOP

The reed clump is shot to shit

INT PENSIONE ABRUZZO- DAY 64
The sound of CHURCH BELLS

JACK is at work

-modifying the SOUND SUPPRESSOR to make it more efficient
-filing the CONNECTORS until the trigger squeeze is softer
-adjusting the position of the TELESCOPIC SIGHT mountings

And finally

-checking the balance of the weapon JACK poises it on the

edge of a ruler over the pencil mark he has determined to be
the guns centre of gravity

The SOCIMI balances perfectly

By now the sun is low and the light fading JACKs eyes are
sore and his fingers aching

He sits on his bed with his hands on his knees silent in the
dying light

INT BROTHEL VIA LAMPEDUSA- NIGHT 65

Were in the living room of a small apartment Its simply
and attractively furnished There are 2 GIRLS not obviously
hookers

The FIRST GIRL is on her mobile phone Every now and again
she glances at JACK The SECOND GIRL approaches him for a
light

JACK
E Clara qui
Is Clara here

SECOND GIRL
Non e stasera qui
Shes not here tonight

She loops her arm through JACKs

SECOND GIRL
Volete una bevanda
Would you like a drink

JACK shakes his head
JACK
Forse un altro tempo
Perhaps another time

EXT CASTEL DEL MONTE- NIGHT 66

JACK parks in his usual hiding spot and heads for his
pensione

A hundred yards ahead of him on the other side of the street
is the same YOUNG MAN he spotted in Castelveccio

Cautiously so as not to spook him JACK continues walking
passing his pensione and heading for the town square

The YOUNG MAN is four parked cars away leaning against a
Fiat parked in front of a small pharmacy his right hand on
the roof bending over as if speaking to the cars local
occupant who appears to be giving him directions

Twice he looks up and gazes along the street in both
directions casually as if keeping an eye open for passing
traffic in the narrow street

JACK side steps swiftly into the local bar

INT BAR- DAY 67
Crowded with locals JACK orders a coffee

Through the window he tries to keep an surreptitious eye on

the YOUNG MAN But the darkness outside throws back

reflections of the bright neon-lit bar within

One reflection catches our attention

The Italian girl CLARA

She is drinking and laughing with friends young Italians
like her She catches sight of JACK

He turns away

EXT CASTEL DEL MONTE- NIGHT 68
JACK comes out of the bar with his hand in his pocket
No sign of the YOUNG MAN

He slips down a side street

EXT SIDE STREETS- NIGHT 69
JACK slips from one side street to another taking full
advantage of short-cuts alleyways and crumbling walls His
route is circuitous It betrays a perfect knowledge of the
maze-like back streets of the town

Eventually JACK peeps out of a tiny passageway half-way down
his own street and on the opposite side of the road from his
PENSIONE

The entrance to the PENSIONE is clear

JACK crosses the street and slips inside

INT PENSIONE ABRUZZO- NIGHT 70
Were in the corridor outside JACKS ROOM

JACK takes his right hand from his pocket

Hes clutching the WALTHER

Slowly he reaches his left hand upwards towards the lintel
above the door where he finds

»a Single FEATHER

From the inside of the room we watch four sturdily fashioned

deadbolt locks slide open Each lock is new and home made

JACK enters shuts the door locks all four bolts And sits
on the bed

73 EXT TRAIN STATION- DAY

Little more than a halt one platform
building- locked and shuttered

JACK steps out of his car
No one around
He checks his watch its exactly noon

A TRAIN approaches

one track

one station

Its a three-carriage local It rattles round the bend in the
track up the valley diesel fumes pluming There are no more
than a dozen passengers on board

MATHILDE is the only one to alight

Her once brown hair is now BLONDE Shes wearing a light
summer skirt and carrying a navy blue canvas sports bag

They shake hands as the train pulls away belching and
honking as it rattles over the girders of an iron bridge and
crosses some alpine rapids
MATHILDE
Mr Clarke How good to see you

again

Something quaint old fashioned in her diction English with
the hint of a Belgian accent

JACK opens the boot of his car and she places her sports bag
beside a WICKER PICNIC HAMPER

MATHILDE
Refreshments

JACK
The Carabinieri around here like
roadblocks Its cover
She nods
They get into the car

As the JACKs door slams we smash cut to

INT CAR- DAY
MATHILDEs sunglasses reflect the alpine landscape

MATHILDE
You picked a beautiful spot

She takes off her shades
Her once hazel eyes are now GREY-BLUE

She glances round the hire cars drab plastic interior

MATHILDE
You would be hard pressed to make a
fast get away in this

Perhaps shes nervous Her attempt at humour isnt working
and she stumbles slightly on her grammar

MATHILDE
would have thought you to have
had at least an Alfa Romeo

JACK
This attracts less attention

MATHILDE

s it far

JACK
Fifty minutes

She looks up through the sun roof at the high mountains over
head

MATHILDE
Up there

JACK nods
She eases herself back resigned to a long climb
MATHILDE
The train was tiring One has to

keep alert so much in cities

Her eyelids are drooping

JACK
Ill wake you before the turn-off

She smiles gratefully But does not shut her tired eyes
The CLOCK on the dash reads 1217

44
INT CAR- DAY 75
JACK negotiates the alpine road leaning into the steering
wheel shifting up or down a gear and glancing from the

mirror to the road and back again

MATHILDE is asleep
JACK scans her taking in every detail her low-heeled shoes
are expensive but she wears no jewelry except a Seiko wrist-
watch on a metal strap and a thin gold chain at her throat
Her tan is light her breasts neat and her legs shapely and
recently waxed

But JACK doesnt look at her like an object of desire He
looks at her cautiously with an expression that says this
young woman is ruthless If she were not she wouldnt be
alive

Thats when he notices the CAR in his rear view mirror

Its too far behind to decipher the make or model and it

weaves in and out of frame as JACK negotiates the alpine
road

MATHILDE wakes with a start The CLOCK on the dash reads
1305

MATHILDE
Are we nearly there

JACK
The turn-offs up ahead

His eyes flick to the rear view mirror Hers to the wing
She spots the CAR behind JACK catches her eye questioningly

MATHILDE
I told you I work alone

JACK slows just before the turn off and pulls over
Then stops
Now its MATHILDEs turn to look questioning

JACK
Just a precaution

He gets out of the car and pretends to urinate
The CAR behind passes at speed

A blue Seat The driver neither slows down nor looks in their
direction

JACK gets back in the car

And turns off up a dirt track that disappears into the
meadows

EXT WOODS- DAY

JACK parks his CITROEN in the shade of the squat but ample
WALNUT TREE In the near distance is a large LAKE This is
the exact spot where he came to test the weapon

MATHILDE gets out of the car and stretches

MATHILDE
Are those houses occupied

JACK looks at the RUINED HAMLET on the hillside

JACK
Derelict I checked three days ago

MATHILDE
We should check again

JACK
Ill check alone There are adders
the mountains And vipers Your
shoes

MATHILDE
Ill be careful

Her voice is curt The trust she showed him in the car is
gone now

EXT ITALIAN LANDSCAPE- DAY

They cross a meadow and make their way towards the RUINED
HAMLET The grass is long and the trees offer deep shade
JACK walks in front to ward off any snakes

Everywhere there is a profusion of wild meadow flowers
MATHILDE has never seen anything so beautiful Overwhelmed
she stops

JACK stops And watches her

She undergoes the same transformation that he did

Then she comes to remembering herself and walks on

Suddenly a four foot ASP VIPER slithers across JACKs
path

He claps his hands and the SNAKE writhes for cover

JACK walks on MATHILDE follows pretending not to be
frightened but walking closer to JACK now scanning the long
grass warily

EXT RUINED HAMLET- DAY 78

JACK scrambles up towards the houses checking the area for
signs of recent disturbance MATHILDE follows

From beside the end building JACK surveys the valley with a
tiny pair of binoculars monitoring every square on the
imaginary grid for human activity

MATHILDE
You have tested the gun here
before

JACK
Yes

Satisfied that hes alone he lowers his binoculars MATHILDE
takes a deep breath of mountain air

MATHILDE
Its beautiful here

She is sitting on a loose stone wall at the edge of what was
once a terraced field Her dress dips between her legs as she
leans forward and rests her forearms on her knees tired from
the journey and the long hot climb

MATHILDE
I wish everywhere could be this
tranquil

JACK looks at her sensing a kindred spirit

JACK
Youd be out of a job

MATHILDE
You dont like the peace
JACK
Its hard to like something you
know nothing about

719 EXT WOODS- DAY 719

The WICKER PICNIC HAMPER is sitting on a rug by between the
parked car and the lake From the hamper JACK removes

-a polystyrene cool box packed with ice and containing a
chilled bottle of Aspirinio

-a loaf of course bread

-two clods of mozarella

-150 gms of proscuitto

-100 gms of parma ham

-a large jar of pitted green olives
-a Thermos of sweet black coffee

-and wrapped in cloth squares the disassembled parts of the
improved SOCIMI SUBMACHINE GUN

As MATHILDE starts to assemble the weapon with easy skill
JACK checks the stopwatch on his ROLEX

It takes her approximately twenty-eight seconds to assemble
the bastardised gun- including TELESCOPIC SIGHTS and SOUND
SUPPRESSOR- and a further three seconds to slot the empty
magazine into the base of the hand grip snuggle the butt to
her shoulder and place her eye beside the rubber cup on the
sight

Shes almost ten seconds faster than JACK

He stares at her not an alluring young woman with good legs
and nice tits but an extension of the weapon itself and
everything it means

MATHILDE
Rounds

JACK
Ive made up two sorts
He reaches into the PICNIC HAMPER

JACK
Thirty lead and thirty jacketed

MATHILDE
I should like a hundred of each

Its an order her voice is emotionless

MATHILDE
And fifty explosive

JACK
Not a problem

He hands her the practise ammunition in two small cartridge
boxes the shells snug in little plastic trays

JACK
Will mercury do

She smiles almost imperceptibly

MATHILDE
Mercury will do very nicely

She puts the gun down butt-first leaning it against the side
of the car

MATHILDE
I have made my own targets

She reaches into her BLUE CANVAS SPORTS BAG and removes
several pieces of folded cardboard strengthened with split
bamboo cane

Without speaking she sets off through the alpine blooms In
her wake flutter a confetti of butterflies and grass
crickets honey bees sizzling frantically as her loose summer
skirt sweeps across the flowers

JACK
Watch out for vipers

He keeps his voice down but she hears him nonetheless waving
with her right hand the hand holding the AMMUNITION BOXES

Shes no fool

Neither is he He has the gun
At ninety meters distance she stops beside a pile of smooth
stones- a boundary cairn- overgrown with little purple
trumpet blooms

She unfolds the cardboard At this distance all we can make
out is a silver-grey shape against the stones

Returning to the car she picks up the weapon

MATHILDE
Muzzle velocity

JACK
At least three hundred and sixty
miles per hour Thats including
twenty off the top for the sound
suppression

Impressed MATHILDE looks at the marks on the metal where the
serial number has been removed with acid

MATHILDE
Socimi

JACK
Eight-two-one

MATHILDE
Ive not had one before

JACK
Youll find it easy Ive re-
balanced it for the longer barrel
The fulcrum is two centimetres
forward of the grip now Which
wont matter if youre firing- and
Im guessing you are- from a fixed
position

No answer

JACK
No major recoil issues You should
be able to hold onto any target
Even the smallest

MATHILDE puts two jacketed rounds into the magazine and
stands with her feet apart braced The breeze beneath the
walnut tree ruffles her summer skirt and presses it against
her legs
CHOOP CHOOP

For a moment longer she holds on the target then lowers the
gun holding it under her arm like a lady on a shire hunt
would hold a 12 bore

MATHILDE
Youve done a good job Mr Clarke
Thank you Thank you very much

She makes a minute adjustment to the telescopic sight with
her fingernail She cant have turned the vertical screw more
than one notch

Then she fully loads and fires again
CHOOP-CHOOP-CHOOP

JACK lifts his binoculars and looks at the target Its the
unmistakable outline of a BOFING 747-400 about one anda
half metres long Painted against the cut-out is the upturn
at the end of the wing The front doorway is shaded in
Standing in it is the SILHOUETTE OF A MAN In the centre of
his head are three small HOLES

With the magazine containing the remaining 28 jacketed
rounds MATHILDE takes aim again

CHOOP-CHOOP-CHOOP-CHOOP

Through his binoculars JACK can see the empty space where
the targets head used to be the scarred stones behind and
the little scraps of cardboard floating on the warm air

JACK

Good shot

MATHILDE says nothing She fills the magazine with lead
rounds snaps it in place and hands the weapon to JACK

MATHILDE
Go to the stones and fire near me

Hes taken aback

MATHILDE
Say
She looks round for a target
MATHILDE
into the bush with the yellow
flowers Two bursts Five seconds
apart
Slowly JACK walks down to the stones turns and looks back
The CITROEN is well hidden in the deep shade of the walnut
tree So is MATHILDE In the poor light all he can see is her
dress and her blouse He wipes the sweat from his eyes and
shuts them tightly
This is not just a weapon test its a test of trust
He opens his eyes again
MATHILDE turns to face him as he shoulders the weapon
He aims the SOCIMI at the YELLOW FLOWERS right beside her
Holds his breath
And pulls the trigger
CHOOP CHOOP
MATHILDE remains untouched
So do the YELLOW FLOWERS
Troubled JACK blinks rapidly and counts to five
Then he fires again

CHOOP CHOOP CHOOP

Through the sight we see two stems of YELLOW BLOSSOM fall
sideways

Relieved JACK walks slowly back to the car

MATHILDE
The sound suppression is superb I
couldnt place the direction of

fire

From her sports bag she removes a plain brown MANILLA
ENVELOPE
MATHILDE
I shall require the rounds and the
weapon by the first of next month
In the meantime would you tighten
the adjusting screws on the sight
they are too loose And lengthen
the stock by three centimetres I
also want a sixty round magazine

JACK
Youll upset the balance

MATHILDE
Im prepared to accept that

JACK
Then Im happy to oblige

MATHILDE
What about the a case

JACK
A briefcase Samsonite Standard
pattern in black with combination
locks Is there a number youd
prefer

She thinks

MATHILDE
Eight-two-one

JACK
Eight-two-one

MATHILDE hands him the ENVELOPE and disassembles the weapon

JACK wraps the SOCIMI parts up in their cloth squares and
places them in the bottom of the PICNIC HAMPER

MATHILDE
What do you want done with these

She has collected up the spent CARTRIDGE CASES

JACK
Throw them in the lake

She walks down to the water and hurls the brass cases in

FISH rise
Again the beauty of the place transfixes her

By the time she turns back JACK has laid out the picnic

MATHILDE
How thoughtful

She picks up a bottle of wine

MATHILDE
I dont know Italian wine

JACK
Aspirinio Like Mosacata but
frizzante

Deftly he uncorks a bottle
And pours it into the grass
JACK
It wouldnt look right if the

picnic wasnt touched

MATHILDE
You chilled the wine I thought

JACK
It had to be chilled Theyre
Italian cops
MATHILDE
(disappointed)
You think of everything

JACK
Im paid to Dont move

She freezes
JACK points slowly
On her tanned forearm is a BUTTERFLY

MATHILDE
Wow

They both stare at the insect transfixed

MATHILDE
Its so beautiful

JACK
Parnassius apollo Its endangered

She looks up at him Like its a revelation she says

MATHILDE
You like coming here

JACK
It serves its purpose

MATHILDE
Youve never taken a woman here

before
JACK is momentarily taken aback

JACK
No

The BUTTERFLY flits away

MATHILDE
(sadly)
Perhaps you do not have a woman in
your life It is not easy for us to
keep relationships Not in our
world

JACK
I have an acquaintance

A beat
She waits for him to say more
He doesnt
MATHILDE
Friendships are transitory It
is

Suddenly theres movement in the bushes

JACK snatches up his BINOCULARS MATHILDE scans the tree
cover

JACK

Wild boar
He hands her the binoculars And hurriedly packs up the
picnic
INT CAR- DAY 80
Her sunglasses back on MATHILDE watches the meadows slip
backwards in the nearside wing mirror as the car bumps back

down the alpine track

MATHILDE
I wish you hadnt brought me here

Again a real sadness

JACK glances at her

MATHILDE
This is the sort of place I wish
Id discovered by myself Then
maybe one day I could have retired
here But you already know it
JACK is touched
JACK
Im much older than you By the
time youve retired Ill be dead
EXT RURAL TRAIN STATION- DAY 81
The CITROEN pulls up
INT CITROEN- DAY 82

The YOUNG WOMANs manner is once more tense and formal

MATHILDE
We will meet as before

JACK nods

The distant sound of a DIESEL ENGINE The train is
approaching

MATHILDE

On the first of next month
He nods again

MATHILDE
Around noon

Not even a nod this time just a slow blink
MATHILDE opens the door runs around to the boot and grabs
her canvas sports bag Then returns to the passenger side of

the car and looks in

MATHILDE
Thank you for a lovely day Mr
Butterfly

She leans in

and kisses him lightly on the cheek her lips light and
quick on his stubble

MATHILDE
You must take your mistress to the

meadow for a picnic

She closes the car door walks onto the platform and vanishes
onto a waiting carriage The TRAIN honks and belches moving
off down the track in the direction from which it came

JACK watches it go

And drives off

Confused

INT CASTEL DEL MONTE LOCAL BAR- NIGHT

Two OLD MEN drinking beer at the bar Two more at a table
playing Scopa with old fashioned Trentine playing cards

Sitting at the back of the room JACK stares at a shot of
Grappa

Above him mounted on the wall is a TELEVISION On the TV is
a Western Charles Bronson and Henry Fonda in ONCE UPON A
TIME IN THE WEST

JACK downs his shot gets up and walks over to the bar Pays

The BARMAN nods at the screen

BARMAN
Sergio Leone Italiano

JACK turns and looks

HENRY FONDA in close-up is about to shoot a red headed BOY
of seven in the head

JACK stares Just at the moment that the gun goes off
-JACK turns away
BARMAN
(in poor ENGLISH)
You like cow boy movie
JACK thinks

Then shakes his head

JACK
Hokey

INT BROTHEL VIA LAMPEDUSA- NIGHT 84
CLARA and JACK are naked

JACK tries to kiss her on the lips but CLARA turns away just
enough to let him know this is against the rules

JACK kisses her neck Her breasts Her stomach

As he moves his head between her legs her fingers (already
ensnared in his hair) tighten their grip stopping him from
going further

JACK looks up at CLARA across her belly and she looks back
at him her expression fixed yet curious

Against her rules but not we sense against her wishes JACK
kisses CLARA softly tenderly deeply until she is moving
against his tongue using her sex like a mouth to kiss him in
return

They make love breaking each of Claras two remaining rules
in turn First JACK puts her in a position she initially

resists Then he kisses her
CLARA comes not wanting to

Suddenly preoccupied JACK does not

INT BROTHEL VIA LAMPEDUSA- NIGHT
JACK is in bed with CLARA

CLARA
Morboso

She looks at him

CLARA
(with certainty)
Morboso

JACK
Morboso

CLARA
Morboso is like when you cant
stop thinking about something

He stares back at her wordless

CLARA
Or someone

A long pause her eyes searching his JACK sits up
cigarette and stands by the window looking through the

blind down into the street

JACK
You neednt act

CLARA
Act

CLARA watches him confused but fascinated

JACK
You might have to act with your
other clients but you dont have to
pretend anything at all with me

She lights herself a cigarette

lights a

JACK
I want you to be yourself with me
Be as indifferent as you like I
came here to get pleasure not to
give it
He hands her CASH
She counts it
CLARA
Maybe I pretend very well I got
more tip than the other girls
usually get
He walks to the door

Pauses

JACK
I dont sleep with the other girls

And leaves

INT JACKS ROOM- NIGHT 86
JACK is asleep
He is not alone
In the bed beside him

INGRID
Pale as death
Eyes rolled back in her sockets

JACK wakes up suddenly gasping
The bed is empty the sheets twisted and damp

EXT CASTEL DEL MONTE- DAWN 87

SUNRISE

-over one of the most desolate and beautiful landscapes in
all Italy
INT JACKS ROOM- DAWN
In the gun-metal light of dawn fiddly work
-cartridges taken apart
-tiny holes drilled in the nose to a depth of precisely 3mm
-the hole half-filled with mercury
-and plugged with a drop of liquid lead
JACK is converting jacketed ammunition into EXPLOSIVE
BULLETS
INT CHURCH- DAY
Outside the sun is merciless Inside JACK has taken refuge
in the cool of the church He is alone He is not praying
Just staring impassively at the gaudy crucifixion at the
thorns and the nails and the running blood
Footsteps JACK checks for reflections in his watch

Its FATHER BENEDETTO dressed for Mass

FATHER BENEDETTO
Ive been looking for you

He mops the sweat from his brow with the hem of his Soutane
takes JACK by the arm and leads him to one side away from
the light of the candles

FATHER BENEDETTO
A man was here asking questions
about you

A beat

JACK
Here

FATHER BENEDETTO
He came to the church this
afternoon

JACK
What did he want

FATHER BENEDETTO
To know where you live He said he
was a friend from Switzerland

JACK
Switzerland
JACK thinks
JACK

And you told him
The priest looks at with complete disdain

FATHER BENEDETTO
Of course I do not tell him How do
I know him He is maybe the police
Certainly he is no friend A friend
would know your pensione
Besides

FATHER BENEDETTO leans close and whispers

FATHER BENEDETTO
Friends do not carry guns

FATHER BENEDETTO glances shrewdly at JACK his eyes searching
into him

FATHER BENEDETTO

If you live in Italy and you area
man of the cloth you meet many
people Besides I lived once in
Naples If you live in Naples you
know the difference between a fat
wallet and a custodia per armi
di spalla How you say in English

JACK
Shoulder holster

FATHER BENEDETTO
Si

JACK glances up and down the aisle

OLD LADIES are dribbling into church in twos and threes
The BELL for mass starts ringing

JACK
Youre a true friend father

FATHER BENEDETTO
I am a priest

JACK turns to go

FATHER BENEDETTO
Signor Clarke

Again the priest leans close holding JACK by the elbow in a
gesture of austere confidence

FATHER BENEDETTO
I make a mistake He did not say he
was from La Svizzera Switzerland
He said- forgive me the names in
Italian are so similar- La Svezia
Sweden

EXT CHURCH ROOF- DAY 90
THREE BELLS are ringing in the tower Beneath them a row of
mediaeval GARGOYLES (dragons griffins dogs and devils) look
down over the little town their faces frightening or
frightened

JACK is among the gargoyles leaning over parapet his eyes
made huge by a pair of tiny binoculars surveying the town
below checking each square of the grid for a glimpse of the
YOUNG MAN

Nothing Then he notices

Parked in the shadow of a spreading chestnut tree not far
from the main square An AUDI

with the YOUNG MAN we spotted in Castelveccio market
sitting at the wheel

EXT CASTEL DEL MONTE STREET- NIGHT 91

The YOUNG MAN comes out of a shop

This is the first time weve seen him up close In his early
thirties hes wearing a dark brown leather jacket and
expensive jeans His blonde hair is cropped short and
theres the hint of a botched prison-cell tattoo visible just
beneath the collar of his shirt
The YOUNG MAN opens a small silver tin and a single deft
movement removes a portion of SNUS (Swedish chewing tobacco)
and inserts the it between his top lip and gum
It is a strangely sinister act
Then he blends in with the tourists milling down the Corso
and round the square heading towards

INT BAR- NIGHT 92

JACK is sitting in the window making himself as visible as
possible to the world outside

He downs a Grappa then gets up to pay for it His movements
are slow and leisurely

The BARMAN hands him his change And a small white ENVELOPE
JACK is not expecting this
BARMAN
(in ITALIAN)
Someone left this for
LAmericano This afternoon

JACK looks at the ENVELOPE

JACK
Grazie

He turns casually away from the BARMANs prying eyes and
opens the envelope with extreme caution

Inside is a folded CUTTING Its from the Swedish Daily
newspaper OSTERSUNDS-POSTEN

JACK unfolds the cutting We catch a glimpse of
-Ingrids dacha
-A police line

-Three dead bodies in the snow the two hitmen and the girl

Heart racing JACK slips the cutting in his pocket
Grabs three SUGAR CUBES from a silver bowl on the bar

And leaves

EXT CASTEL DEL MONTE TOWN SQUARE- NIGHT 93
The YOUNG MAN is watching a PUPPET SHOW in the middle of the
square The PUPPETEER is using glove puppets and the Punch

and Judy style performance involves Punch fucking Judy with a
grotesquely carved outsize sex organ There is a large crowd
gathered

JACK leaves the bar turning left and walking purposefully
down the street

The YOUNG MAN follows

EXT CASTEL DEL MONTE CORSO FREDERICO- NIGHT 94

Its a hot summer night and there are more tourists than
usual

The YOUNG MAN uses them as cover

JACK turns down a dark deserted alleyway

The YOUNG MAN hesitates

His right hand moves casually to his jacket pocket

And he follows

EXT ALLEYWAY- NIGHT 95

Were with the YOUNG MAN as he stalks his prey through the
mediaeval maze of streets

We end up in the narrow alleyway that JACK photographed on
his first day in town

Up ahead disappearing round a distant bend we catch a
glimpse of JACK his heels CLACKING on the cobbles

The YOUNG MAN follows swiftly his trainers silent He gets
to a crossroads where FOUR NARROW ALLEYWAYS- all identical-

converge The YOUNG MAN is unsure which alleyway to take
The streets are empty

He listens

From an upstairs window he can hear the soundtrack of a late
night film on television Its a romantic film the violins
muffled and sad with longing

From another alleyway comes the sound of SAVAGE BARKING The
YOUNG MAN looks around for the source of the barking but the
streets are empty

Suddenly the barking stops

The YOUNG MAN looks confused

From his right hand jacket pocket we hear the unmistakable
CLICK of a cocking mechanism

EXT COURTYARD- NIGHT

Were recognise the secret courtyard the one reached by
means of the hidden archway

With one hand JACK feeds another SUGAR CUBE to the MONGREL

With the other hand he holds his WALTHER behind his back

and cocks it

EXT ALLEYWAY- NIGHT

The YOUNG MAN is waiting at the far end of the alleyway
hugging the wall scanning the CROSSROADS ahead unsure which
of the four possible alleyways holds his prey

JACK emerges from the HIDDEN ARCHWAY and walks quickly up
behind him

JACK has removed his shoes and his bare feet are silent
He has thirty metres to cover The gun hangs heavy in his
right hand Its fitted with a TAC 65 SOUND SUPPRESSOR He

raises his right hand

Twenty metres

The gun is pointing at the YOUNG MAN

Fifteen metres

His finger takes up the slack of the trigger
Ten meters

Then

A DUCATI turns into the alleyway behind JACK its headlights
on full beam

JACK drops his right hand and thrusts his silenced WALTHER
deep into his jacket pocket

The YOUNG MAN looks his way

JACK is outlined by the mopeds beam of light
The two men are face to face within spitting distance

The DUCATI hurtles towards the YOUNG MAN

The MAN ON THE DUCATI is wearing a tinted BLACK CRASH HELMET

The YOUNG MANs eyes widen with fear

BANG

The DUCATI misfires

Mistaking the sound for gunfire the YOUNG MAN drops rolls
and fires back

We hear the sound of a single suppressed shot CHOOP

The BULLET grazes the FRONT SUSPENSION of the DUCATI and

lodges in the REAR COWLING

The MAN ON THE DUCATI swerves and crashes hitting a stone
staircase

JACK looks around
The YOUNG MAN has disappeared

The MAN ON THE DUCATI is out cold

The front wheel of his DUCATI turns slowly squeaking
CHOOP

A bullet hits the road not far from JACK

CHOOP

Another bullet hits the wall behind him

Swiftly JACK grabs hold of the battered 1970s DUCATI

EXT CASTEL DEL MONTE MEDIAVEVAL MAZE- NIGHT 98
JACK rides the classic DUCATI turning left and right without
hesitation through archways down steps dropping level by
level cursing in time with his jagged breathing until

EXT CASTEL DEL MONTE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN- NIGHT 99

JACK emerges from the bottom of the town and races away on
the winding road

Silence All we can hear are the crickets
Then the sound of a car

An AUDI tears past us following JACK out of town

EXT ALPINE ROAD- NIGHT 100

JACK is heading for the mountains He takes the first corner
at 70 MPH

The AUDI gleams black in the moonlight Gaining on him

EXT ANOTHER ANGLE- NIGHT 101

JACK takes the next bend at top speed his classic 1970
1000cc engine howling

The AUDI slows then powers through the bend accelerating

INT AUDI- NIGHT 102

The YOUNG MAN puts his foot down

The SPEEDOMETER climbs

EXT ALPINE ROAD- NIGHT

The AUDI comes up swiftly behind Jacks DUCATI and tries to
ram him

JACK dodges the AUDI swerving from one side of the road to
another

EXT VIADUCT- NIGHT

A soaring concrete bridge spans a plunging alpine valley
The AUDI overtakes the DUCATI then swerves left trying to
crush JACK against the concrete barrier that masks a three
hundred and fifty foot fall

JACK breaks hard and the AUDI misses him smashing into the
concrete barrier amidst a shower of sparks and screeching

metal

The AUDI follows the DUCATI into

EXT ALPINE TUNNEL- NIGHT

Long dark neon-lit and blind curved

The AUDI comes up fast behind the DUCATI

Jack swerves the DUCATI onto the other side of the road

The AUDI swerves left and tries to crush JACK into the left-
hand wall of the tunnel

Suddenly a CAR comes round the bend
What happens next happens fast

JACK swerves left and skids into a SERVICE LAY-BY narrowly
avoiding the CAR

The lay-by is small and JACK has to slide the DUCATI on its
side as he crashes it into the box-like space

The lay-by is too small for the AUDI

The AUDI and oncoming CAR collide

The AUDIs crumple zones buckle as both vehicles bonnets
concertina like a road safety test

The AUDI has air bags The oncoming CAR does not

On impact its DRIVER goes through the windscreen of his own
car and onwards through the windscreen of the AUDI

The wreckage is awesome

Deep within the mangled metal of the two cars
the YOUNG MAN groans and twitches

JACK appears at the crumpled window of the AUDI

He reaches through the broken window grabs the YOUNG MAN by
the head

and breaks his neck

EXT WOODS- DAWN 106
JACK washes away the worst of the dirt and the blood ina

He winces with pain

Her limpid brown eyes twinkle

INT CLARAS APARTMENT- DAY 109

A small simply furnished bedroom with a bed a desk and a
chair

As he sips a large cup of strong black coffee CLARA cleans a
vicious welt on his right shoulder blade

As the dirt and blood come away she reveals an exquisite
tattoo

Of a BUTTERFLY

CLARA
Ve bene Tutto posto Signor

Farfalla Good Everythings OK
Mr Butterfly

His eyes open wide and he turns to her quickly

JACK
Why dyou call me that

A beat

CLARA
You have a tattoo On your back

Of course
He relaxes

But not completely

EXT CASTELVECCHIO- DAY
The situation at the beginning of the movie is perfectly
reversed

From the relative safety of CASTELVECCHIO JACK watches

-The Bar
-The pensione DAbruzzo

No sign of the police No sign of any Shadow Dwellers

EXT CASTEL DEL MONTE TOWN SQUARE- SUNSET

JACK is in his usual phone box His manner is quietly

purposeful

JACK
How did he know I was here Larry

LARRY (VO)
You think I hired him

A beat

LARRY (VO)
Are you out of your fucking mind
Jack

JACK
I doubt it

LARRY (VO)

WHAM
Something smacks into the phone box at high speed

JACK drops to his knees and reaches for his WALTHER
Outside the phone box three TEENAGERS are kicking a FOOTBALL
around
INT JACKS ROOM- NIGHT 112

TINS of fruit drops three kinds black cherry pineapple and
lemon Each tin is emptied of its fruit drops

Twenty rounds of ammunition- each round packed in silica- fit
exactly into each tin

Lead rounds in the black cherry jacketed in the pineapple
and explosive in the lemon

JACK re-seals each tin with sellotape

EXT LAQUILA CORSO FREDERICO II - DAY 113
The colonnades of this popular pedestrain street are crowded
with window shoppers tourists taking coffee old men
discussing politics and office girls walking hand in hand and
chattering like songbirds

JACK is in dark glasses Hes sitting in a coffee shop under
the colonnade sucking a fruit drop and reading a copy of Il
Messagiero

CU we see hes studying a small column concerning the
murder of two prostitutes in the nearby city of Chieti

JACK spots CLARA walking along the corso Shes with a girl
he has not seen before ANNA ANNA is small town girl with a
keen sense of fashion She and CLARA are hand in hand

CLARA sees JACK and speaks to her friend
They cross through the throng of boulevardiers

CLARA
My friend Anna This is my friend
Signor Farfalla

CLARAs eyes twinkle mischievously

The girls cease to hold hands and ANNA offers hers to JACK
JACK half rises like the perfect gentlemen folding his
newspaper and accepting ANNAs greeting

JACK
How do you do

ANNA

I am very well thank you

Ah This is to be an impromptu English lesson JACK
acquiesces gracefully

JACK
Will you take a coffee with me

CLARA
That would be very good

He indicates two empty chairs

JACK
Prego
CLARA moves her chair to sit closer to JACK Under the table
her knee presses against his

ANNA also moves her chair nearer to JACK but her motive is
to move it out of the sun She is not flirting

CLARA
Anna is learning English

JACK
Have you been to England

ANNA seems momentarily confused

ANNA
But you are

She looks at CLARA

ANNA
Lui Americano

JACK
I am

JACK glances at CLARA
How much has she told her friend

ANNA
Ah I have not been to England only
to France But I would love to go
to America

The WAITER comes over

JACK
Due cappuccini e un cafe corretto

CLARA
Anna is like all Italians She
thinks America is like in the
movies Little Italy West Side
Story Chicago
(MORE)

CLARA (contd)
I tell her in these times America
is like here there anywhere The
streets are not pave-ed with
gold
She beams happily at JACK He smiles back at her

JACK
If not with gold than at least not
with enough medieval cobbles to
loosen every-self tapping screw in
a Fiat

JACK beams Neither girl understands But everyone smiles
happily

The WAITER brings the coffee and CLARA insists on paying

JACK
Where do you come from Anna

ANNA frowns JACK plays teacher

JACK
Dove abita

ANNA
Ah yes I live in Via dell
Argilla Nearby to Clara

JACK briefly wonders what else he could teach her He scans
both girls and decides CLARA is the prettier CLARA seems to
sense this She smiles to herself

JACK is touched

114 EXT CORSO FREDERICO II LAQUILA- DAY 114

We cut wide and watch JACK talk inconsequentialities with the
girls They stand to go JACK rises

CLARA
Perhaps we will have a drink
together soon I am free

Her words sound rehearsed She considers a crowded timetable

CLARA
on Monday

JACK
Great Ill see you then

CLARA
But Eduardo Where would you like

to meet

Again rehearsed JACK is not expecting this CLARA looks at
him mischievously ANNA is listening

JACK
How about our usual place

CLARA
Our usual place

She feigns complete perplexity

CLARA
I forgot Where is our usual place

JACK
Youve forgotten

CLARA
Remind me

The twinkle in her eye Shes testing him JACK is the
perfect gentleman

JACK
Maybe we should try something
different
CLARA
Where would you like to try
Eduardo

A beat JACK spots a restaurant on the opposite side of the
road

JACK
Locanda Grapelli

There is no warmth in his suggestion But CLARA doesnt care

CLARA
Locanda Grapelli Si

She looks genuinely delighted

ANNA
This is the best food in the area

delight to meet you Anna
Arrivederci

ANNA
Arrivederci Signor Farfalla

There is an unmistakable twinkle in ANNAs eye How much she
knows is uncertain She kisses him swiftly and softly on the
cheek
CLARA does the same on the lips Behind the mischief in her
eyes is something doubtful Has she gone too far

115 EXT DOWNTOWN LAQUILA- DAY 115

JACK visits three stores

-In a PHOTOGRAPHIC SHOP he buys half a dozen FILM PROTECTION
BAGS

-In a HABERDASHERS he purchases several packets of HOOKS and
EYES like the kind you find on brassieres

-In a OFFICE SUPPLY SHOP he buys some custom made headed
notepaper invoice books notepads envelopes metal pens a
calculator and a mobile phone

INT JACKS ROOM- NIGHT 116

JACK opens a black combination lock SAMSONITE BRIEFCASE and
lines the bottom and sides with the lead-lined film
protection bags cut to fit

Into the base of the briefcase he glues pre-shaped pieces of
firm grey plastic foam These form the pockets into which he
slots the constituent parts of the SOCIMI SUBMACHINE GUN
They fit perfectly

Over this JACK uses the HOOKS and EYES to clip a false
bottom a tough card cover onto which are pasted the custom

made headed notepaper invoice books notepads and envelopes

To the briefcases central divider he adds the metal pens a
calculator and a mobile phone He sets the combination to
821 Then shuts and locks the BRIEFCASE

This done he sits on the bed and stares at the case With his
work complete he is struck by a terrible sense of emptiness

EXT PARCO DELLA RESISTENZA - JUST BEFORE DAWN 117
A small park not far from Castel Del Montes town square

It is just after dawn The pine trees and the poplars are
silent The sun is not yet up but the day is light Sparrows
hop about searching for crumbs

JACK ravaged by lack of sleep wonders about like the demon
of a lost darkness looking for his hole down to the
underworld

FATHER BENEDETTO
Buon giorno

Hes twenty meters away his hand raised in half-welcome
half-benediction

They greet one another and FATHER BENEDETTO falls into slow
step with JACK The priest walks with his hands behind his
back JACK with his hands in his pockets
FATHER BENEDETTO
I walk here to meditate Once a
week Wednesday the farthest one
can travel in the week from the
Sabbath The trees are like the
Stations of the Cross by certain
trees I thank God for certain
favours he has granted me or
certain gifts he has made to me and
all men For example here by this
pine I thank him for the many
friendships I have and ask him to
look after those of my friends who
are troubled

They reach a Cypress tree and FATHER BENEDETTO bows his head
in prayer After a while he says

FATHER BENEDETTO
Some walk here in the cool of
evening Others come at night

There is a slight sadness in his voice as he says to himself

FATHER BENEDETTO
I wonder how many bastards have

been made here

He gives a small sideways glance at JACK

FATHER BENEDETTO
Perhaps youll stay and settle here
yourself

JACK
What makes you think Im leaving

FATHER BENEDETTO
You told me as much when we first
met Besides those who seek for
peace seldom find it Theyre
always moving on looking
elsewhere A BEAT And they are
usually sinners

JACK
All men are sinners

FATHER BENEDETTO
Some are greater sinners than
others And those who seek peace

have much sinning in their history

JACK
I dont seek peace I never have

FATHER BENEDETTO
Until now

JACK
Perhaps Perhaps Ill stay The
valley The villages The
mountains

FATHER BENEDETTO
Forgive me This is the priest in
me speaking And the friend But
you have done much sinning Signor
Clarke You still do

JACK
I see a whore Shes young enough
to be my daughter

FATHER BENEDETTO
I do not refer to the sins of
carnality But to the deadly
sins

JACK
Arent all sins equal

FATHER BENEDETTO
We are not discussing theology my
friend but you You like this
town this valley

(MORE)

FATHER BENEDETTO (contd)
You should like to remain here and
find your peace at last Yet you
cannot There is something you
cannot ignore Some force Some
enemy

JACK is silent

FATHER BENEDETTO

You want to speak but you dare not

You know no one sufficiently well
to share your history with them

You know I am trustworthy yet still
you are cautious

FATHER BENEDETTO stops compelling JACK to stop too- and face
him

FATHER BENEDETTO
What job do you do Signor Are you
on the run as they say

JACK
Who says

FATHER BENEDETTO
Its an expression no

JACK
Everyones on the run from
something

FATHER BENEDETTO
Some men watch some of the shadows
You watch them all

JACK
Ive done nothing I didnt have
good cause to do

FATHER BENEDETTO
Do you wish to tell me

JACK
For what reason

FATHER BENEDETTO
For your own sake Perhaps I can
pray for you

A change of pace

JACK
I make things Artifacts

FATHER BENEDETTO

Counterfeit money

JACK
Why do you say that

FATHER BENEDETTO
You work in metal You are given
some steel by Fabio the car
doctor

JACK
You know a lot about me

FATHER BENEDETTO
I know only what you do in the
town People talk to me I am their
priest and they trust me

JACK
And I should too

FATHER BENEDETTO
Of course

They stare at one another
JACK wants to confess He does not know why
But he doesnt He does something were not expecting

JACK
Fabio The ‘car doctor Was he
conceived here father

FATHER BENEDETTO is motionless

FATHER BENEDETTO
Why do you ask me that

JACK
He looks like you Even more than
he does in the photos you keep of
each other Where was he conceived
father Under one of these trees
At night Like all the other
bastards

There is a very very long pause FATHER BENEDETTO stares up
at JACK with extraordinary intensity

FATHER BENEDETTO
I do not remember Signor It was
twenty-five years ago

FATHER BENEDETTO walks JACK follows A gust of wind makes
dust swirl from the gravel path The two men do not speak

again until they reach the next set of Cyprus trees

FATHER BENEDETTO
In the end it is I who confesses to
you

JACK
Expecting me to reciprocate

FATHER BENEDETTO
Perhaps For your own good You
cannot doubt the existence of Hell
You live in it It is a place
without love As for me I go about
my daily duties because the town
requires it of me Some know what
you know Perhaps I have no right
to wear these robes But I do have
a heart full of a fathers love
Something close to His heart And
for that I am both grateful and
happy

On JACK

FATHER BENEDETTO
What do you have my friend

Another gust of wind The priest looks up into JACKs face

The assassins eyes are red and stinging Perhaps its from
the dust

INT JACKS ROOM- EVENING

JACK dresses very carefully for dinner

It is clear he wishes to make a favourable impression upon
CLARA

EXT LOCANDA GRAPELLI- NIGHT

Stone steps lead up from the street to large paved veranda
that overlooks the town Overhead a canopy of vine and

jasmine Above that a sky full of stars

Of the thirty or so candle-lit tables that dot the veranda
more than half are occupied by romantic couples

JACK scans the tables and checks his watch Its shortly

after seven pm and theres no sign of CLARA
He waits Then turns to leave
CLARA (0S)

Ciao

She kisses him once on the lips Shes hot and flustered
Shes been rushing

CLARA
I did not think you would come

JACK
I wasnt sure you meant me to

CLARA looks doubtful Its the same look she gave him at the
cafe She is breaking the golden rule of prostitution
Getting involved Her heart is pulling one way and her head
another

CLARA
Certo

A WAITER approaches

WAITER
Per due

Judging by his disapproving tone the WAITER seems to know
what CLARA does for a living CLARA senses this immediately

CLARA
Si

EXT LOCANDA GRAPPELLI- NIGHT

CLARA and JACK sit at a table overlooking the town

The WAITER lights their candle and deposits two menus
peremptorily

CLARA
Una botiglia di acqua minerale non
gasata et una Parasini per

favore

Completely ignoring her the WAITER addresses JACK with a
wink

WAITER
Menu in Inglese

A beat

JACK
No grazie

WAITER
Tedesco Olandese

CLARA
(to the WAITER)

He speaks Italian So do I Listen

She repeats her order articulating each word emphatically
like a teacher to a slow school child

CLARA
Una botiglia di acqua minerale et
una Parasini per favore

She isnt upset Its just her way of letting both men know
that shes in charge

The WAITER turns to her deferring to her strength of
character

WAITER
Gasata

CLARA
Non gasata

He nods with some genuine deference and leaves
CLARA sighs
CLARA
(mostly to herself)

Cittadina

JACK
Small towns

JACK smiles CLARA smiles back They have this contempt in
common
The WAITER reappears and pours a thumbful of wine It is pale
red in colour and frizzante At CLARAs insistence JACK
tastes it It is dry and has a tar-like aftertaste

CLARA
Parasini From Calabria It is
good you will agree

JACK
It is Very good

He looks at her and- for a brief moment- he undergoes what is
a unique experience for him a positive longing to repeat
this brief moment many times in the future

CLARA catches the glow of his warmth and blossoms

CLARA
Can I ask you something Eduardo

JACK
Sure

CLARA
You are married

JACK
No

A beat

JACK
I doubt any of the couples here
are With the exception of the
Germans at table seven Shes
wearing a wedding ring and they
havent spoken a word to each other
for eight and half minutes

CLARA
I was sure this was your secret

JACK
What makes you think I have a
secret Im an ordinary man I
cough I fart I earn a living

JACK observes a GYPSY selling roses

CLARA
I do not think you are an ordinary
man I think you are a good man
But you have a secret

The GYPSY approaches offering CLARA a ROSE She refuses
firmly

CLARA
He thinks we are a couple

JACK signals to the GYPSY and buys CLARA a ROSE

JACK
Why spoil the illusion

She looks at him and smiles
CLARA
(in ITALIAN)
As long as we know it is an
illusion
Her smile is only a little bit sad
Still JACK doesnt know what to say

They are saved by the appearance of the WAITER

WAITER
Buona sera Desidera

CLARA orders full of Italian charm putting JACK at his
ease He watches her contentedly the way she talks and
moves

121 EXT CORSO FREDERICO- NIGHT 121
JACK and CLARA are walking He has a cigarette in his mouth
They look like film stars CLARA slips her arm through his

with other couples

122 EXT COFFEE BAR- NIGHT 122
The coffee bar has an outside section CLARA and LAMERICANO
are seated in a throng of happy youngsters Claras age JACK

is the oldest person there

The WAITRESS brings two glasses of PROSECCO She puts a small
silver bowl of raspberry ice cream down in front of JACK In
front of CLARA she puts down an extravagant ice cream sundae
CLARA grins at her sundae like a little girl Shes a bit
drunk

CLARA
Woooow

She eats savoring the ice cream JACK watches savoring her
pleasure

JACK
How is it

CLARA

JACK

CLARA

She scoops a spoonful dripping with nuts and chocolate sauce
and holds it out to JACK

JACK

She turns the phone to silent And looks up at JACK

CLARA

CLARA
This cannot be for sale But I am

JACK
Give it away

She looks at him
JACK studies her searching for his own feelings

CLARA
Stronzo I buy you a present

She fishes about in her handbag

and produces a SILVER BOX

JACK unwraps the shiny paper Inside is a plastic case like
the sort you put engagement rings in Inside the case is a

BADGE hand-painted depicting the symbol of the region the
eagle of LAquila JACK sticks the BADGE in his lapel

JACK
Grazie
An embarrassed beat
CLARA kisses him
JACK

Grazie Clara

CLARA
Prego Eduardo

A pause
CLARA
My apartment is not far from here
123 INT CLARAS APARTMENT- MORNING 123

JACK opens his eyes

Sits up
Hes shocked to have slept so deeply
CLARA must be in the shower

He looks around at the little room casually like a curious
lover

Opens the top drawer of the bedside cabinet
Finds a VIBRATOR
Opens the bottom drawer

Finds a RED PURSE

Inside the RED PURSE
Finds a BERETTA DOUBLE-ACTION MODEL 21A BOBCAT
Just at that moment CLARA comes out of the bathroom

JACK shuts the drawer and pretends to be asleep

124 EXTPAY PHONE- DAY 124

JACK has driven to the remotest phone box he can find not
far from the entrance to one of the regions four national
parks beside a lake below a mountain range and approached
by a long straight empty road

No one could possibly creep up on him here Nevertheless as
he talks JACK makes his habitual and continuous 360 scan of
the area

LARRY (VO)

125 INT LARRYS APARTMENT ROME- DAY 125

LARRY is sitting in a high back leather office chair before a
large imperial mahogany desk In front of him are two banks

of screens

The first bank displays 3 CCTV views the entrance to his
apartment block a staircase and the entrance to his
apartment itself

Another bank of screens shows 3 NEWS CHANNELS CNN BBC WORLD and AL JAZEERA

LARRY

her associates think someone on

LARRY
The crooked kind

JACK (VO)
How come Im still here

LARRY
The Belgians think theyre planning
to wait for the drop and
exterminate you and Mathilde in one
swoop

With the help of his DESKTOP computer LARRY is comparing the
scrolling share prices on CNN with the fluctuating value of
the US DOLLAR

JACK (VO)
Where the hells this information

JACK looking through his miniature binoculars
His POV

Of CLARA seated in a cafe talking to a slick tough YOUNG

ITALIAN MAN in a suit

He is showing her photographs Of what- we cannot see CLARA
looks very very serious

The YOUNG ITALIAN MAN leaves JACK watches him get into a
smart black ALFA ROMEO containing two other ITALIAN MEN Rome

plates

When he looks back at the cafe CLARA has gone

INT PENSIONE ABRUZZO JACKS ROOM- DAY 130

-150 gms of proscuitto

-and his WALTHER PPKS

EXT CASTEL DEL MONTE- DAY 131
CLARA is waiting on the Via Strinella near the entrance to
the Parco della Resistanza sheltering in the shade of a

tree

She is holding the RED PURSE At her feet is blue plastic bag
rounded out by a watermelon

JACK pulls his CAR into the curb

CLARA
Ciao Eduardo

She opens the passenger door leans in and kisses JACK long
and full on the lips

JACK
Put them in the back Weve got a
way to go
She puts the plastic bag in the trunk

Inside the trunk is the PICNIC HAMPER

INT CAR- DAY 132

CLARA climbs in and fastens her seat-belt

She puts the RED PURSE between her legs
RED PURSE

And drives

It is a beautiful day isnt it

JACK

EXT ALPINE ROAD- DAY

The CAR negotiates a familiar hairpin bend

INT CAR-

DAY

CLARA is station hopping

She finds

some LOU REED She loves LOUD REED

JACK glances at the

JACK is concentrating on the road

CLARA
Is it more far

JACK
Ten kilometres Another twenty

minutes

She pauses to work out the mathematics Shes smart And
puzzled But shes not frightened Not yet

CLARA
Twelve kilometres In twenty

minutes

JACK
Were going off the beaten track

She looks confused

JACK
Lontano Fuori mano

CLARA laughs
CLARA
You will speak Italian One day I
will teach you
EXT ALPINE TRACK- DAY 135
JACK turns off the main road and onto an alpine track

This is the same route he took with the Belgian woman

The CAR bumps and tilts on the rough terrain

INT CAR- CONTINUOUS 136
CLARA is startled by such an insignificant track

CLARA
Where are we going

Now shes anxious This is not what she expected
JACK
You shall see

CLARA
I think it is good we should stay
close to the road

JACK
Theres no need to worry Ive been
here before several times Taking
photographs

He swings the wheel suddenly to avoid a large boulder and the

Citroen pitches as if struck by a wave

CLARA clings to the door with her right hand her left hand
dug deep into the fabric of the seat to steady herself

JACK
Youre not afraid of coming into
the wild with me are you

CLARA
No

She laughs tensely
CLARA
Of course I am not Not with you
But this

She snaps her fingers

CLARA
sentiero

She waves her hand in the air

CLARA
You should have a jeep A Toyota
It is not good for a berlina

Its as if the increased danger of the track diminishes her
English

JACK
This is a Citroen

He strikes the steering wheel hard with the palm of his hand
JACK
This was made by the French for
taking potatoes to market Besides
I always come here in this car

CLARA
You sure

JACK
Of course I dont want to walk
back to town any more than you do

CLARA
I think you are crazy This will go
to nowhere

JACK
I assure you it does

She pouts her reply The TRACK disappears into a WOOD and
runs out altogether giving way to grass

CLARA
Now there is no road

JACK stops the car and turns the engines off
Sudden silence
CLARA lets go of the seat

CLARA
Is this where we go

They are surrounded by trees

JACK
No Not quite We go another
hundred metres through the wood
But from here we just roll forward
No motor No sound And youll see
a wonder

She grips the seat again
JACK
You wont need to hold on Ill go

slowly Just relax and look

He eases his foot off the brake and the car begins to move
forward the springs squeaking slightly After 50 metres JACK
twists the steering wheel slightly and applies the brakes
They roll gradually down to the outer edge of the woods and
come to a stop beneath a familiarly squat but ample WALNUT
TREE

Beyond them is the LAKE the MEADOWS and the RUINED HAMLET
The hidden valley is a riot of colour the blooms and
blossoms more brilliant than weve ever seen them By the
edge of the lake stands a HERON still as fence post

CLARA gets out of the car dumbstruck JACK gets out too He
watches her then swiftly checks the ruined hamlet through
his miniature binoculars Deserted By the time CLARA turns
towards him the binoculars are hidden

CLARA
No one comes here

She speaks so quietly JACK can barely hear her

JACK
No

CLARA
Just you

JACK
Yes

CLARA turns away unbuttons her blouse and drops it on the
grass She is wearing no bra On her back dapple the shadows
and patches of sun eking through the branches of the walnut
She kicks off her shoes which curve through the air and
unzips her skirt It falls to the grass She bends and steps
daintily from her knickers Then turns to face JACK

JACK cannot take his eyes off her Dizzy he steps forward
without meaning to

CLARA
Well

She is coquettish- and tosses her auburn hair to one side
CLARA
I am going to swim in the lake Are

you coming

She doesnt wait for his reply but turns and runs through
the grass towards the water

JACK
There are vipers Vipera Marasso

CLARA
Maybe But I am lucky

The HERON flies off rising from the reeds with an ungainly
flapping

CLARA
(shouting)
He is an Italian bird We disturb
his siesta

Quickly JACK glances inside the CITROEN
The RED PURSE is nowhere to be seen

CLARA
Come Signor Farfalla

JACK undresses As he removes his clothes he stalls for
time using the cover of undressing to search for the RED
PURSE

We can see it wedged under the passenger seat
Due to the design of the car JACK cannot

CLARA
Come

JACK turns to face the lake He is naked Yet with the
caution of years he does not remove his shoes until he

reaches the waters edge

CLARA is standing in the middle

CLARA
Stand by me

He obeys her order He walks out to her and she takes his
hand under the water holding it out in front of them

JACK spots it resting on the smooth stone of the lake-bed
Brassy and gleaming A SPENT SHELL He covers it with his
foot
CLARA
Keep still Watch

As the ripples of his arrival peter out in the reeds TINY
FISH appear in a shoal to gather about their hands They
hover like slivers of glass just under the surface then move
in to nibble at the skin on their fingers

JACK
f we stay here for a year theyll
devour us

CLARA
t is said that if these fishes
bite at two hands holding then
love is good for the people

He looks at her and for a moment he forgets the awful plan in
his head

She kisses him pressing herself against him her skin and
body as pure and warm as the water

He tries helplessly to pull away

JACK
Maybe we should

CLARA
Do you make love in the water

JACK
I havent

She places her arms around his neck and raises her feet from
the smooth stones wrapping her legs around his waist She
tries to push herself onto him but he resists

CLARA
Whats wrong

He doesnt know what to say She looks at him confused
searching

JACK
Lets eat

He walks towards the bank She follows The tiny fish dart
around them for a few moments then flee for the reeds
travelling with the waves made by their departure
137 EXT LAKESIDE- DAY 137
CLARA is lying naked on a blanket
Beside her is the RED PURSE
Through sleepy half-closed eyes she is watching LAMERICANO
From her POV JACK is kneeling behind the open PICNIC HAMPER
unpacking the food and wine The LID of the basket obscures

his hands

CLARA
Eduardo

JACK looks at her

CLARA
Is this your real name

A beat

JACK
Is Clara yours

CLARA
Si Yes

She looks at him Waiting for his reply

JACK
Edward is my real name

CLARA
Ed-ward

She doesnt believe him

CLARA
You are sure you are not married
Eduardo

JACK

Quite sure
About this hes telling the truth
CLARA reaches for the RED PURSE

From behind the picnic hamper lid we hear the CLICK of a
cocking mechanism
CLARA hesitates for a moment

JACK watches her intently
She reaches into her purse
JACK is expressionless

When CLARA withdraws her right hand she is holding a tube of
SUNTAN LOTION

A beat

JACK watches as she commences smoothing it into her skin
rubbing it around her breasts pushing them aside pressing
them upwards Then she caresses the lotion into her belly and
down her thighs bending at the waist as she works it into

her shins

CLARA
Will you put this on my back

She proffers him the SUNTAN LOTION

JACK stares at her baking body transfixed by its terrible
and perfect beauty

Hidden behind the LID of the picnic hamper
-his trembling right hand grips tightly to his WALTHER
A long pause

CLARA
Eduardo

Hes frozen

CLARA
Amore

Time seems to stop
ECU on JACK
Suddenly CLARA sits up

CLARA
Eduardo whats wrong
JACK swallows
When he speaks his mouth his dry

JACK
Nothing

When he moves towards her he is holding nothing in his
hands

He takes the tube of SUNTAN lotion

JACK (VO)
Dear Father Benedetto

And begins to run it into CLARAs back
JACK (VO)

I promised myself that I would

write to you- as your friend- to

say goodbye

138 EXT WOODS- DAY 138

SLAM
JACK shuts the boot of the car
He scans the lakeside
No sign of the picnic

No sign of CLARA

JACK (VO)
Everything Ive ever done

Then he spots something

On the ground not far from the car
He walks over and picks it up

Its one of CLARAs shoes

JACK (VO)
Ive done for a reason
JACK is staring at the SHOE

JACK (VO)
I never thought the day would come
when Id run out of reasons
Reasons to worry Reasons to run
Reasons to pull the trigger

JACK turns and walks over to the car
CLARA is in the passenger seat

JACK (VO)
Maybe that days come

JACK gets into the Citroen

JACK (VO)
Or maybe Ive just found a reason
to change

And hands CLARA her shoe

CLARA
Grazie Eduardo

JACK
I still dont understand Whats
the point of a gun if its not
loaded

CLARA
One of the girls borrow it to me
after the second hooker in Chieti
is murdered With some of the
clients it make me feel safe I
dont tell the police of course
but Madonna Eduardo How they
do to these two women A police
agente from Rome show me
photographs They show photographs
to everyone in Via Lampedusa

CLARA shivers with disgust
CLARA

Non capito how one person hurt
another in this way

JACK looks lost like a man drained of all resolution

JACK
Does the gun make you feel safer
with me

CLARA
You are not a client

JACK
Then whys it in your purse

CLARA looks unhappy

Silence

CLARA
I have to work tonight amore

JACK looks away

JACK (VO)
Maybe this is suicide Cops often
put the graft on working girls
Perhaps the girl I told you about
Clara has sold me out
(MORE)

JACK (VO) (contd)
Maybe shes a cop herself or maybe
shes a hired gun Then again
maybe Clara is who she says she is
and my Belgian clients will take
the gun shoot me themselves and
keep the money Always a risk in my
profession Or perhaps my trusted
colleague in Rome no longer trusts
me Perhaps even you Father with
your connections in Naples

CLARA
What will you do

JACK
I guess Ill go to work too

CLARA
And after that Tomorrow and the

next day

JACK
I cant stay here forever

As the words leave his lips he thinks how much he wishes he
could

JACK (VO)
ts not that Ive given up on
life Father Just the way that I
was living it If you can call it
living

CLARA
want always to stay here

JACK
ts time to go home

CLARA
Let me come to your home

JACK
cant Clara One day

Shes upset but decides not to press her demand

JACK (VO)
If I had one request Father it
would be this That its not Clara
who finally pulls the trigger But
whoever it is

CLARA kisses him and simply says
CLARA

Stay forever here

JACK (VO)
by this time tomorrow Ill be
dead

Fade to black

A POSTMAN hands the mail to FATHER BENEDETTO

FATHER BENEDETTO
Ciao Fabio come stai

We follow FATHER BENEDETTO inside as he rifles through a
bunch of church circulars One LETTER catches his eye

He opens it and starts to read aloud
FATHER BENEDETTO

Dear Father Benedetto I promised

myself that I would write to you-

as your friend- to say goodbye

INT JACKS ROOM- DAWN 140

JACK stands by the door in a impeccably pressed suit the
black SAMSONITE BRIEFCASE in his hand

He surveys his room All evidence of his existence has been
meticulously tidied away

FATHER BENEDETTO (VO)
Everything Ive ever done

JACK leaves
Only thing is left behind

The book of MEDIEVAL ITALIAN ART and ARCHITECTURE on the
bedside table

FATHER BENEDETTO (VO)
Ive done for a reason

EXT AUTOSTRADA- DAY 141
The sun is shining The mountains young and sharp and
beautiful The CAR moves swiftly across the viaduct that
spans a spectacular gorge and plunges into a long tunnel

INT CAR- CONTINUOUS 142

JACK watches the road On the long straights he looks
backwards and forwards

143 EXT SERVICE STATION- DAY 143

JACK comes off the autostrada on a slip road and pulls into a
forecourt consisting of several rows of Agip and Q8 pumps a
convenience shop a repair garage and a cafe

The car park is not large JACK parks the Citroen facing the
EXIT There is a single bar across it but this is raised

JACK double checks the magazine in his handgun is full and
slips his WALTHER into his jacket pocket

Stepping out of the car he looks around the car park Its
only a quarter full and ominously quiet Somewhere in the
distance we can hear a sound creak creak creak creak

JACK takes the BRIEFCASE from the rear seat and walks away
He makes a show of locking the car but doesnt

As he approaches the CAFE he passes the GARAGE We see the
source of the creak creak creaking sound a SIGN for engine
oil on hinges revolving slowly in the breeze

144 INT AUTOSTRADA CAFE- DAY 144
Empty

JACK sits at a table at the back of the cafe From here he
can see both entrances the public entrance and the service
entrance and also the door to the bathrooms Through the
window he has a good view of the garage forecourt and the
slip road to and from the autostrada

JACK places the BRIEFCASE on a chair beside him and puts a
PAPER BAG on the table next to the sugar dispenser He checks
his watch It is two minutes before noon He orders an
espresso

His nerve-heightened senses take in everything the sound of
the cicadas the buzz of the neon strip-lights and the creak
creak creak of the engine oil sign outside endlessly
revolving

JACKs eyes flick outside to the forecourt

We hear the cafe door open
And in an instant MATHILDE is at his table

She is dressed in a tight black skirt a simple blue blouse
and a dark blue jacket Her hair is neatly styled her make-
up immaculate and heavier than weve seen her wear before
She looks exactly like the kind of woman who might carry a
Samsonite briefcase

MATHILDE
Hello I see you have brought it in
from the car with you

She speaks quietly her voice low and attractive

JACK
All there as agreed

MATHILDE
Whats in the paper bag

The WAITRESS comes over with Jacks coffee MATHILDE orders
another for herself

JACK
Sweets For your journey

She opens the bag and takes out one of the TINS
She can immediately feel that its heavier than it should be

JACK
I guessed youd have a sweet tooth

MATHILDE
That is most thoughtful of you

The polite phrase sounds even more polite with her slight
Belgian accent

The WAITRESS returns with the second espresso and MATHILDE
pays for them both

JACK watches as she stirs her coffee to cool it Shes
nervous

JACK
I suppose Ill read about this in
the Times or the International
Herald Tribune Or Il Maessagiero

For a moment she is pensive

MATHILDE

Yes I expect so

She drinks her coffee holding her cup in mid-air and looking
out the window

JACK follows her eye-line to check shes not signalling to an
accomplice

The FORECOURT is still empty
Creak creak creak creak
MATHILDE looks at JACK Her expression is impossible to read
Perhaps its tinged with sadness She drinks the rest of her
coffee
MATHILDE
Im just going to the ladies Wait
here

She picks up the CASE

There is nothing JACK can do about this She has taken him
off guard and grasped the initiative

All he can do is wait

INT AUTOSTRADA BATHROOM- CONTINUOUS 145
MATHILDE enters a cubicle opens the CASE bypasses the
stationary lifts the false bottom and checks the SOCIMI

parts are present and correct

Then she loads a magazine

INT AUTOSTRADA CAFE- DAY 146
MATHILDE returns from the bathroom

MATHILDE
Shall we go

Not a question a command

JACK is obliged to stand up
147 EXT AUTOSTRADA CAR PARK- DAY
MATHILDE walks towards a large FORD
She is carrying the BRIEFCASE
JACK has his right hand in his jacket pocket
MATHILDE

You wont need your piece

The slang word belies her For an instant she has forgotten
her Belgian accent She sounds American

JACK
You never know

She stops beside the FORD

JACK still has his hands on the Walther

MATHILDE
OK
JACK
Sure You
MATHILDE

Everythings just fine
She definitely sounds American now
Her RIGHT HAND slips into her pocket
JACK twists his wrist upwards and thumbs the cocking lever

MATHILDE
Final payment

She hands JACK an ENVELOPE

MATHILDE
Buy yourself a retirement clock

Her American accent shows that shes letting her guard down

Maybe its designed to make JACK do the same

It doesnt

JACK
How do you know Im retiring

She leans forward and kisses him lightly and quickly and on
the lips

MATHILDE
Have you taken your girl up to the
meadow yet
JACK doesnt answer His whole body is tense for the bullet
that he knows his coming Perhaps there is a second person in
the car
Just then
a COACH pulls into the car park
It stops with a hydraulic hiss and dozens of TEENAGE KIDS
descend

MATHILDE looks both irritated and relieved
MATHILDE
(whispers to JACK)
Do it

She gets into the drivers seat of the FORD and swings the
BRIEFCASE into the back

MATHILDE
Goodbye Mr Butterfly

JACK tenses as MATHILDE raises her hand in farewell

The FORD pulls away and disappears down the slip road onto
the autostrada

JACK watches it go

Thumbs back the lever on his Walther
Gets into his Citroen

And opens the ENVELOPE

-No wires

-No tricks

-Just a HUNDRED THOUSAND US DOLLARS

JACK stares at the money He isnt supposed to be alive For
a while he stays put He shuts his eyes in the sunshine and
listens to the laughter of the teenage kids To a girl
calling Amore To the cicadas To the distant rush of
traffic on the autostrada

SMASH CUT TO

JACK drives fast

Were at another roadside service station
LARRY comes out of a Kentucky Fried Chicken
He climbs into the passenger seat of the FORD

MATHILDE drives off
151 INT FORD- DAY 151
LARRY is dusting bread crumbs off his shirt
Hes about to get his hands dirty and he doesnt like it

LARRY
Not only did you not kill him you
gave him my fucking money

MATHILDE
What else could I do There were
ids everywhere Besides hes
suspicious

LARRY

Hes paranoid Thats why Im
paying you the GDP of a small
country to get close to him You
could have got him in the sack You
should have got him in the car
park Now youre going to have to
take him out long range

MATHILDE
I prefer it that way

She is a trained assassin She respects JACK

MATHILDE
The Socimi is the perfect weapon

LARRY
Lets hope his workmanship is up to

scratch

He slams a full magazine into the butt of a STERLING
SUBMACHINE GUN

LARRY
Sweden turned Jack into a
liability Three stiffs two
shooters and an innocent civilian
I cant afford a mistake like that
again Europol are crooked but they
arent cheap Jacks supposed to
make me money Not run up cleaning
bills

MATHILDE
He made short work of the last guy
you hired

LARRY
Never mind Larson He didnt stand
a chance not against someone as
paranoid as Jack The Swede was
only there to take Jacks heat off
you So dont fuck this up again

He grabs a TIN of fruit sweets

LARRY
Mind if I help myself

LARRY opens the tin to find it full of AMMUNITION

LARRY
Shit

He looks around the Ford
LARRY

Is there any actual candy in this
gas guzzler

EXT AUTOSTRADA- DAY

JACK turns off under the sign for CASTEL DEL MONTE

EXT CASTEL DEL MONTE CHURCH STEPS- DAY

The town square is jam-packed with cars and coaches

Hundreds of tourists and locals have gathered on the church
steps There is even a camera crew

The church doors open and FATHER BENEDETTO steps out to a
huge cheer

Behind him LOCAL MEN are carrying a larger than life painted

wooden STATUE OF SAINT DOMINIC

Draped over the saints shoulder and wrapped around his neck

are around twenty five or thirty live SNAKES- local Viperi-
each one several feet long and as thick as a skinny forearm

A local BAND strikes up as the STATUE is carried down the
steps FATHER BENEDETTO leading the strange annual religious
parade around the town square followed by a group of ALTAR
BoYsS

EXT CASTEL DEL MONTE STREET- DAY 154
The giant FORD pulls up outside the towns only proper HOTEL

MATHILDE gets out carrying the SAMSONITE BRIEFCASE

EXT CASTEL DEL MONTE TOWN SQUARE- DAY 155

JACK is looking for someone The square is so tightly packed
its hard to see let alone move

Then he spots her
CLARA

Shes on the other side of the square standing on the stone
steps beneath a STATUE OF AN EAGLE Her friend ANNA is beside
her taking photographs of the parade with a small digital
camera JACK moves towards CLARA

ANNA through her viewfinder is the first to notice him She
points JACK out to CLARA CLARA waves at him She says
something to ANNA and descends into the crowd JACK and CLARA
squeeze their way through a sea of bodies towards one another
as we cut to

EXT HOTEL ROOF- DAY 156

MATHILDE emerges through the fire escape door and walks to
the edge of the roof

She opens the black SAMSONITE CASE and unpacks the top layer
of office paraphernalia to reveal the disassembled parts of
the SOCIMI SUBMACHINE GUN

Expertly she assembles the bastardised gun- including
TELESCOPIC SIGHTS and SOUND SUPPRESSOR- slotting a full
magazine into the base of the hand grip snuggling the butt
to her shoulder and placing her eye beside the rubber cup on
the sight

157 EXT POV FROM TELESCOPIC SIGHTS- DAY 157

In the centre of the CROSS-HAIRS

JACK and CLARA meet
She kisses him It is a long and loving kiss
The CROSS-HAIRS find the centre of JACKs head
158 INSERT 158
MATHILDES FINGER taking up the trigger slack
159 EXT TELESCOPIC SIGHTS- DAY 159
Other HEADS
-TOURISTS
-LOCALS
-KIDS on their PARENTS SHOULDERS
keep blocking our view of JACK
160 INSERT 160
The TRIGGER FINGER hesitating
161 EXT TOWN SQUARE- DAY 161

Were right in the midst of the crowd

JACK and CLARA have to shout at one another above the noise
of the band

JACK
When can I see you

CLARA
I have to work tonight

Their happiness clouds over But the clouds pass quickly
CLARA
You come to my apartment after

JACK
If I asked you would you come away
with me

CLARA

JACK
Forever
A pause
JACK

Unless you have other plans

CLARA
Other plans

She swears in Italian Obscenities Then throws herself
around JACK and squeezes him with all her strength There are
tears in her eyes

CLARA
I love you Signor Eduardo
Farfalla

He looks at her

JACK

INSERT 162
The TRIGGER FINGER squeezes
The SOCIMI SUBMACHINE fires

An EXPLOSIVE BULLET travels down the chamber at approximately
360 miles per hour headed straight for JACKs temporal lobe

Only it never gets there

The gun jams

A chamber explosion is a nasty thing Instead of shooting out
of the barrel the round explodes in the cannons chamber

Hot shrapnel fragments like a land mine ripping into
MATHILDEs hands forearms and face
EXT CASTEL DEL MONTE TOWN SQUARE- DAY 163

A loud BANG pulls JACK and CLARA apart Amidst the noise of
the festival no one else seems to notice

JACK looks in the direction of the HOTEL ROOF

CLARA
Whats happening

JACK
Someone got what was coming to
them
He turns to her
JACK

Go to your apartment and pack Wait
“till I get there Dont answer the
door to anyone but me
CLARA
Eduardo please

JACK
Trust me

She looks at him

CLARA
I trust you

She wants to but she doesnt

JACK
Clara My name is not Eduardo

CLARA

JACK
My name is Jack

CLARA
Jack

She looks worried

CLARA
You promise youre not married

JACK
I promise Take this

He hands her an ENVELOPE It contains his final instalment

JACK
Look after it In case

CLARA
(perplexed)
In case
He wants to say it but he cant bring himself to

In case this is goodbye

JACK
Now go

EXT STREET- DAY 164
LARRY is waiting on the corner of the town square

He is dialling and re-dialling a number in his mobile phone
scanning the crowds around him

In the two seconds it takes the TAXI to pass by JACK steps
free of a row cars on the other side of the street

As LARRY comes into view again JACK sees the STERLING
SUBMACHINE GUN in his hands

And LARRY sees JACK
LARRYS FINGER tightens on the trigger
LAMERICANO throws himself to one side

fq

There is a quick burst of popping explosions ripping along
the line of parked cars

PANIC erupts

JACK is about to fire back at LARRY but LARRY takes cover
behind a TOURIST and fires back another brief burst

JACK is hit in the shoulder He drops his gun
and retrieves it just as LARRY fires again
SCREAMS spread through the holiday crowd like a wave of fire
moving down the street and spilling into the town square

EXT TOWN SQUARE- DAY 165
JACK runs into the square
LARRY pursues him firing for a third time
The buzz of spent rounds and the crack of muzzle fire echo
around the square bouncing off the walls and confusing the

crowd

People start to run in different directions- everyone heading
for the maze of alleys that surround the main square

ALTAR BOYS scatter So do the LOCAL MEN carrying the STATUE
OF SAINT DOMINIC The STATUE tumbles and smashes Escaping
SNAKES writhe FATHER BENEDETTO takes cover

The two LOCAL CARABINIERI in their Land Rover get caught up
in the chaos Confused they turn on their SIRENS

LARRY spots JACK in the crowd and fires a fourth time
One TOURIST is killed outright another injured

JACK dives for cover behind the STATUE OF THE EAGLE where he
spotted Clara

Bullets ricochet

LARRY
Youre too old for this life Jack

LARRY struggles for breath as he reloads
This is JACKs chance

LARRY
You get sentimental then you fuck
things up

Rolling along the steps to the statue of the eagle JACK

spreads his legs faces LARRY and fires the customary TWO
PRECISION-ENGINEERED SHOTS that make up a military-style

execution

The first shot hits LARRY in the heart LARRY is thrown
backwards against a parked car accidentally altering his arc
of fire as slugs bounce off the steps beside JACK chips of
marble stinging against his calves

Again JACK takes aim

A beat as his finger tightens on the trigger

HEADSHOT Half LARRYS FACE is wiped out of existence Whats
left of him slides down the parked car onto both knees His
hand flashes to his mangled throat then drops He falls

forwards and his STERLING clatters on the cobble stones

Complete silence
Not even the sound of a siren

The town square is empty
Except for FATHER BENEDETTO hiding in the wreckage of the
broken STATUE

Jacks WALTHER hangs ominously by his side

FATHER BENEDETTO stands unsteadily

Like lightening JACK spins instinctively raising his WALTHER
and zeroing in on FATHER BENEDETTO His face is devoid of all
emotion He is a bloody machine looking at a potential
target

We hear SIRENS

Across a slew of dead bodies JACK keeps the gun pointed at
FATHER BENEDETTO

FATHER BENEDETTO stands stock still facing JACK
The SIRENS get louder

JACK
What will you tell them

A beat
FATHER BENEDETTO takes something from inside his Soutane
And holds it up with a trembling hand
JACKS LETTER
FATHER BENEDETTO
I will them that the man who wrote
this letter is my friend

FATHER BENEDETTO smiles sadly

FATHER BENEDETTO
Jack

FATHER BENEDETTO shuts his eyes muttering a quiet prayer
The SIRENS get closer

We hear Carabinieri screeching to a halt and clambering out
of their cars cocking submachine guns

When FATHER BENEDETTO opens his eyes again

JACK has disappeared

EXT CASTEL DEL MONTE- DAY 166
Using his meticulous knowledge of the alleyways and lanes

that make up the medieval heart of the town JACK avoids the
CARABINIERI and stealing a bicycle makes it onto the main
road before a road block has been set up

EXT LAQUILA COACH STATION LEFT LUGGAGE- DAY 167

JACK collects a sports bag from a LOCKER

EXT LAQUILA COACH STATION BATHROOM- DAY 168

JACK washes the blood from his hands

EXT LAQUILA COACH STATION MAIN HALL- DAY 169
When he emerges from the bathroom JACK is wearing the clothes
of a fifty year-old American tourist from the mid-West with
glasses and a baseball cap

He checks the time of next bus to Rome

Then glances at his watch

He has thirty minutes

EXT LAQUILA STREET- DAY 170
JACK walks towards Claras APARTMENT BUILDING

Two hundred metres up ahead two OFFICERS of the Guardia di
Finanza wait in an unmarked car

JACK walks past Claras APARTMENT BUILDING

And keeps walking

EXT LAQUILA COACH STATION- DAY 171
The BUS for Rome is barely half-full
Blending in perfectly with a group of middle aged American

tourists JACK boards the steps purchases a ticket and takes
a seat at the rear
172 EXT AUTOSTRADA- DAY 172
A long tunnel one of the longest in Europe
JACK alone at the back of the BUS

It seems like night red stripes strip lights shadows
Vast fans suspended from the ceiling shift the traffic fumes
A button of light expanding

as we burst into daylight

THE END
