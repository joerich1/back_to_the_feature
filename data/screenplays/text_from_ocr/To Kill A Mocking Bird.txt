TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD

FADE IN
EXT MAYCOMB ALABAMA - DAYBREAK

We are looking down on the small Southern townof Maycomb
Alabama It is just before dawn and in the half light we

can see cotton farms pine woods the hills surrounding Maycomb
and the Courthouse Square of Maycomb itself The CAMERA STARTS
TO SLOWLY MOVE down to the Square As we begin to see the
stores and the offices which comprise the town a young womans
voice is heard OFF CAMERA

JEAN LOUISE (VOICE OVER)
In 1932 this was the world I kmew
It wasnt a very big world but
neither was I
(a beat)
I was six years old

THE CAMERA STARTS TO SLOWLY MOVE DOWN the main residential
street leading away from the Square

JEAN LOUISE (VOICE oveR)
They tell me Maycomb was a tired old
town then that people moved slowly
There was no hurry for there was no-
where to go nothing to buy and no
money to buy it with

During this THE CAMERA HAS COME TO REST ON the Finch house

and yard The Finch house is a small frame house byilt high
off the ground and with a porch in the manner of Southern
cottages of its day The yard is a large one filled with oaks

-and it all has an air of mystery about it in the early morning

light

JEAN LOUISE (VOICE OVER)
What I remember was that I was to
begin school in two weeks for the
first time What I didnt kmow was
that my whole world was soon to
change

WALTER CUNNINGHAM a thin raw-boned farmer in his late
fifties comes into view He is carrying a crocker sack full
of hickory nuts He passes under the oak tree at the side

of the house as a young girl six dressed in blue jeans
drops from one of its branches to the ground She brushes
herself off and goes toward Mr Cunningham

anything in the house and that
hed rather Id just shoot tin cans
in the back yard But he said
sooner or later he supposed the
temptation to go after birds would
be too much and to shoot all the
blue jays I wanted if I could hit
them but to remember it was a sin
to kill a mockingbird

JEM
why

ATTICUS

Well I reckon because mockingbirds
dont do anything but make music for
us to enjoy They dont eat peoples
gardens they dont nest in corn-
cribs they dont do one thing but
sing their hearts out for us Anyway
thats why I think its a sin to kill
a mockingbird

up over her fingernails Her bottom plate is not in and her
upper lip protrudes From time to time she moves the nether

BACK TO ATTICUS - As he talks he looks‘into the eyes of the men X
of the jury as if to find one to encourage him

ATTICUS
To begin with this case should never
have come to trial The State has
not produced one iota of medical evi-
dence to the effect that the crime
Tom Robinson is charged with ever
took’ place It has relied instead
upon the testimony of two witnesses
whose evidence has not only been
called into serious question on cross
examination but has been flatly con-
tradicted by the defendant There is
circumstantial evidence to indicate
that Mayella Ewell was beaten savagely
by someone who led almost exclusively
with his leftand Tom Robinson now
sits before you with the only good
-hand he possesseshis right hand
I have nothing but pity in my heart
-for the chief witness for the state
She is the victim of cruel poverty
and ignorance - but my pity does not
extend so far as to her putting a
mans life at stake which she has
done in an effort to get rid of her
own guilt I say guilt gentlemen
because it was guilt that motivated
her She has committed no crime she
has merely broken a rigid and time-
honored code of our society a code
so severe that whoever breaks it is
hounded from our midst as wnfit to
live-with She must destroy the
evidence of her offense What was
the evidence of her offense Tom
Robinson a human being She must
put Tom Robinson away from her Tom

man No code mattered to her before
she broke it but it came crashing

for the state with the exception of
the Sheriff of Maycomb County have
presented themselves to you gentle-

confidence that their testimony would
not be doubted confident that you
gentlemen would go along with them

Negroes are basically immoral beings
that all Negro men are not to be
trusted around our wamen an assump-
tion one associates with minds of
their caliber which gentlemen- we
kmow is in itself a lie I do not have

respectable humble Negro who had

sorry for a white woman has had to
