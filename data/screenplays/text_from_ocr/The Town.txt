FADE IN
EXT HARVARD SQUARE PLAZA

Early morning Just after eight The Plaza where people
come up from the subway station Some kiosks nearby

An ARMORED TRUCK idles in front of Out of Town News The
driver sits behind the wheel taking slightly nervous
stock of the morning scene

A CITY WORK TRUCK idles across from the bank

The COURIER (the guy who “couries” the dolly in and out
of the bank) goes around to the back of the armored
truck He opens the door and pulls out a DOLLY and a
METAL BOX We see his SIDEARM on his hip

The Courier begins pushing the dolly across the plaza
toward the bank We TRACK WITH him The walk winds
around kiosks He weaves through various PEDESTRIANS and
LOITERERS TRAVELERS DRUGGIES AND KIDS We get the
sense that something must be about to happen It
doesn’t Sees a SUSPICIOUS PERSON passes him nothing
happens Wends around a work truck stopped in front of
the bank Still nothing

The Courier reaches the bank doors Safety He opens
the door and steps in

INT CAMBRIDGE MERCHANTS BANK - CONTINUOUS ACTION
BOOM With extraordinary violence the Courier is
SLAMMED in to as if by a savage HOCKEY CHECK by a MAN
(DOUG) WHO is MASKED AND ARMED

THREE MORE ARMED MASKED MEN move past them shouting

MASKED MEN
Empty your pockets Take it out

The stunned employees are PUSHED BACK while the bandits
quickly rifle their pockets for cell phones

A TOUGH THIEF (JEM) JUMPS THE COUNTER and goes after the
employees in the back

A HEAVY THIEF (GLOANSY) zip ties the door

A LARGE THIEF (DEZ) gets cell phones from people in the
front

Everything has gone very fast to this point Now it

A STUDENT is trying to open the front door pushing
against the ZIP TIE around the entry doors

Doug’s attention is pulled to Claire lying face-down
behind the teller cages

Her heel is slowly moving Her foot PRESSES A BUTTON
UNDER THE COUNTER -- then quickly glides back

Claire looks the other way and sees Doug’s mask
STARING at her

She’s caught She’s dead
The student finally gives up walking away
Doug stares at terrified Claire After a beat

Jem HITS HIM WITH BUTT OF THE RIFLE then again then
again Bearns’ head is bouncing between the floor and
Jem’s rifle the stock tearing open a good piece of skin
above his temple Jem keeps hitting him

In his RAGE the back of Jem’s MASK COMES UP REVEALING A

Doug pulls out a small knife He tugs at her jacket hem
CUTTING OFF a strip of fabric -- making her flinch

As THE VAN LURCHES FORWARD he ties it around her head as
a blindfold He makes a fist and drives it -- STOPPING
JUST SHORT OF HER NOSE Making sure she can’t see

He sits back STUDYING her with impunity

As he stares at her we have a NON-LINEAR SEQUENCE where
we FLASH BACK TO Doug scouting the bank job observing
Claire as she came and went from work -- but we HEAR a
conversation between Claire and an FBI agent that takes
place AFTER the robbery

FLASHBACK - EXT CAMBRIDGE MERCHANTS BANK

Doug watches intently from Au Bon Pain’s patio as Claire
comes to work in the morning

FRAWLEY (VO)
Ms Keesey I want to start with
your abduction then take you back
through the robbery itself Could
you see anything through the
blindfold

You must be kidding

Several agents are at work in the area including DINO

FRAWLEY
Dino what’s the first thing the
BPD does when there’s an armed car
robbery in the city

DINO
Close the Charlestown bridge

Dino indicates a photo of the CHARLESTOWN BRIDGE with
police swarming it stopping traffic

FRAWLEY
And he’s from Charlestown

DINO
They get back over use each
others’ yards houses ditch us
pretty quick

FRAWLEY
Heisting banks is a trade in
Charlestown Like villages in old
Europe that would specialize in a
certain craft In the Town it’s
armed robbery

She seems taken aback by the rabbit hole she has walked

through

FRAWLEY
I don’t understand it But it’s a
lot easier when you know what
bridge to close

CLAIRE
So do you like send out teams

DINO
I’m afraid this doesn’t warrant
the resources for surveillance

up a chair The guy says to the
priest ‘you’re wasting your time
I know for a fact there is no
God’ Priest says ‘How’ He
says ‘I was an explorer at the
North Pole I got lost in a storm
once I was blinded and freezing
to death and I prayed if there’s
a God save my life’ The priest
looked at him confused and says
‘but you’re alive God saved
you’ Guy said ‘God No God
never showed up That’s what I’m
saying Some Eskimo came along
and took me back to his camp’

while he drowned in his own blood
So I don’t know how out of bounds
the lunch special is

He bites into the sandwich

FRAWLEY
They can rationalize everything
Rob banks hey it’s insured by
the government Who insures the
government They lionize
criminals and then complain about
the crime And they view me as
the bad guy By the time your
mother and sister are heroin
addicts it’s a little late to re-
think your models for who the good
guys are

That’s right These people have
fundamentally misunderstood that

CLAIRE (CONTD)
I kept thinking how my mothers
tell their daughters not to get
in cars with strange men and now I
was in a car with strange men who
had guns and were probably looking
for a place to drop my body And
no one spoke Which made it
worse When I was sure I was
going to die I got really calm
Then they stopped and let me out
Over at the beach in South Boston
-- where the planes come in

DOUG
Would you recognize their voices
if you heard them again

for a beat

CLAIRE
Yeah I’m sure I could

Doug considers this

DOUG
That might be harder than you
think
(beat)
At least you weren’t hurt

CLAIRE
No But David was My assistant
manager He was assaulted really
badly when the alarm went off

DOUG
He hit the alarm

She doesn’t immediately respond

DOUG
Did he see anything or know
anything

CLAIRE

He’s been at Mass Eye and Ear for
a week for eye surgery I still
haven’t been able to see him and I
feel like a terrible person

DOUG
Then I guess that’s where we’re
going

THE TOWN - Rev 52010 (Buff Reshoots) 41

Before Doug can come up with a response sees a COP
sitting in a chair outside a room It gives him
instinctive pause

CLAIRE
You should come in

DOUG
You sure

CLAIRE

Yeah you should meet him

INT HOSPITAL RECOVERY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

David Bearns propped up against an avalanche of pillows
gauze and bandaging masking his face

Doug stays put while Claire crosses the room and kisses
his cheek

CLAIRE
I feel bad I should have brought
you something David

BEARNS
Uh people bring so much clutter --
it’s like what am I supposed to
do with balloons Make animals

CLAIRE
(pulling up chair)
So they’re hopeful

BEARNS
Well hopeful means I may recover
fifty percent of my sight in this
eye I just want to get back to

work

CLAIRE
No you don’t I just went back
today

BEARNS

Well you have memories One
inconvenience I was spared

DOUG
I’m gonna leave you guys alone

Doug does an awkward wave as he retreats to the doorway

I won’t keep her long But we
will talk about you

INT HOSPITAL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

While Claire is inside Doug stands awkwardly next to a
COP who can’t resist letting him in on the deal

COP
You heard what happened Big take-
down robbery

DOUG
Is that right
COP
Took a hostage They laid the guy

out
Doug looks out waits a beat to respond
DOUG

Good thing you’re here The guys

INT DUNKIN’ DONUTS - LATER

The neon loneliness of an empty urban coffee house at
night

DOUG
Your friend got a tough break

Claire looks away

CLAIRE
I lied to the FBI

Not what Doug expected

CLAIRE
It was my fault I hit the alarm
It wasn’t David

DOUG
He thinks he’s a hero Least he
got something out of it

CLAIRE

He got to lose the sight in his
right eye

( )

THE TOWN - Rev 52010 (Buff Reshoots) 43

DOUG
What you did was brave
(beat)
And there was nothin’ you could do
to help your friend

CLAIRE
Should I tell the FBI

DOUG

No cops are just people like
everyone else They want to find
a bad guy so they can go home and
nuke their supper And that’s
whoever’s talking the most

(beat)
I would just let this go

CLAIRE
There’s something else

Doug tastes copper in the back of his throat

DOUG
What
CLAIRE
I saw something during the
robbery
DOUG
What
CLAIRE

Something I can identify
Doug’s heart is pounding

DOUG
Okay

CLAIRE
When the guy attacked David his
shirt came up and I could see a
tattoo on his neck

Jesus Christ

DOUG
Of what

CLAIRE
One of those Fighting Irish
tattoos

( )

THE TOWN -

Fucking Je

A beat

She shows

This sinks

Suspicious

Rev 52010 (Buff Reshoots) 44

DOUG
Probably a lot of guys out there
with those

CLAIRE
He had a gun in one hand and I
think a bag of money in the other

mM

CLAIRE
What should I do

DOUG
You can tell the FBI

no reaction

DOUG

If the guy has a record they’1ll
know the tattoo and they’1l ring
him up the next day And they’1l
charge him with weapons and
robbery and he’ll get thirty-five
years

(beat)
Then they’1l arrest all his known
associates I guess they’d want
those guys to turn on him but if

they don’t -- someone’s gonna come
looking for the witness and the
FBI will put you in witsec -- I’m

just guessing but it sounds like
you have to move to Cleveland and
never talk to anyone you know for
a decade

in

DOUG
Or you can wait You have a card
right now You can put that in
your pocket Play it when you
need to not when anyone else
needs you to

CLAIRE
Quite an expert

A reproach She thinks she’s stung him

EXT CLAIRE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

They get out of the car and walk toward Claire’s front
door Doug looks around furtively

CLAIRE
Do we know each other well enough
where I can tell you that this
truck is a little much

DOUG
I know It’s good for work but
there are only two intersections
in the North End wide enough for
me to take a right -- but I can
fit your Prius in the back if you
need a tow

CLAIRE
How did you know I had a Prius

Whoops

DOUG

CLAIRE
I don’t know if they were the same
ones who wrecked my car but it
started with yelling at me when I
walked by -- then they got really
aggressive and they seemed to be
I don’t know targeting me
Discretion being the better part
of valor once glass bottles
started being thrown -- I started
coming to terms with not being
cool enough to walk through the
projects

DOUG
They threw bottles at you (Where
was this)

CLAIRE
I’m fine I just have to go the
long way

They are in front of her gate time to say good night

He raps on the metal door
From within

chain but Jem HITS IT with the SLEDGEHAMMER -- sending
ALEX SPRAWLING BACK into his apartment

Doug and Jem seamlessly continue their momentum and rush
through behind the door

INT ALEX COLAZZO’S APARTMENT - INSIDE - CONTINUOUS
ACTION

Jem removes an EXPANDABLE METAL STICK and uses it to
CRACK the FAT FRIEND of Alex’s across the face as he
emerges to help

Doug is all over Alex punching and stomping him It is
a very fast brutal flurry of violence that is more a
beating than a fight -- despite the fact that if
anything Jem and Doug are outsized

Jem opens a bag of WHITE POWDER and THROWS some on ALEX’s
FACE and SCATTERS THE REST ON THE FLOOR

DOUG
Another deal gone ‘sour’ for you
assholes

Doug looks around the room sees what he is looking for
EMPTY BEER BOTTLES

DOUG

EXT CHARLESTOWN COMMUNITY GARDENS - DAY

The sun shines across the garden We see the New Town
projects behind Doug across the water and a soccer field
populated by immigrants mid-game behind Claire She digs
in the dirt as Doug watches her sitting on a wood beam

DOUG
So how’s work now all right

CLAIRE
It’s okay It’s a routine
That’s what I liked about working
there It’s ordered Or it was
My childhood was kind of chaotic

DOUG
Really

CLAIRE
My mother has personality
disorder Do you know what that
is

DOUG
Never heard of it

CLAIRE
The primary clinical symptom of
personality disorder is that you
are irritating and crazy

Doug laughs

DOUG
I got some friends with that

CLAIRE
My father wasn’t very good at
handling it I wasn’t very good
at becoming an only child and she
was basically a lunatic -- but
maybe a lot of people would say
that about their mother

We see some miles traveled in her eyes Shrink’s offices
and a hard-won forgiveness of herself and her parents

CLAIRE
What about yours

DOUG

I couldn’t tell you She left
when I was six

( )

THE TOWN -

Rev 52010 (Buff Reshoots) 52

CLAIRE
What happened

DOUG
She left

CLAIRE
Okay

She goes back to her garden Then he starts talking

DOUG

This sound woke me up I thought
it was an animal I’d never heard
aman cry When I saw my father
in the kitchen all I remember is
the ashtray A hundred
cigarettes Ash like a little
mountain He stopped crying and
he was sitting there watching TV
on our little black and white with
no sound I think he just didn’t
know what else to do He saw me
standing in the doorway and he
just goes ‘your mother left
She’s not comin’ back’ Just like
that Smokin’ cigarettes and
eatin’ a TV dinner at six in the
mornin’
(beat)
We lost our dog the year before
I wanted to make these posters so
if she was lost someone could call
us like the guy who found our dog
To this day my father will tell
you he helped me make those
posters But he didn’t He sat
there and drank a case of beer and
I went around by myself on School
Street asking people if they seen
my mother

(beat)
Her name is Doris MacRay and her
mother had a restaurant called
Carrol’s in Tangerine Florida
Still there For a long time I
let myself think that was where
she went But somewhere along the
line I came to terms with the fact
that if she left it was fora
reason she didn’t want to be my
mother and she wasn’t coming back

She has stopped gardening and been listening to him

Rebound from what The robbery
Anyway I feel estranged from them

understand anymore It feels like
I’m leaving them behind

Oh yeah Boys and Girls

It’s under a local heroes banner --

He is a little embarrassed

CLAIRE
When I said I knew you they acted
like I was dating Tiger Woods It
was almost like they were
intimidated of me

DOUG
I wasn’t that good

CLAIRE
Apparently you were ‘drafted’
I’m pretty sure they only do that
to the good players

DOUG
Yeah I was drafted like a lot of
other guys And I didn’t do what
it took to make the team And I
got a second chance and I blew
that too When it was over for
me I wasn’t smart enough to see it
or classy enough to accept it So
I did a lot that make things
worse I look at that picture and
see a kid who thinks he knows
everything and is about to throw
it all away

Doug’s honesty takes him by surprise and has a propulsive
quality

DOUG
Can I be your boyfriend

She smiles surprised

I havent had a ‘boyfriend’ since

is at once both soft and electric

ancient turns and alleys -- built to accommodate horses
(and even those only narrowly) in the 1700’s Driving

spins and they SHOOT THROUGH THE FRONT WINDSHIELD Then
they turn the car around and continue on Another
CRUISER joins the pursuit at this point Another cruiser
comes down a perpendicular street and Doug stands up out

begin treating the subject kindly

gotta tell you you’re an
asshole

in Malden for a box of quarters
You banged it out in the North End
with assault rifles at nine in the

right in the mouth Because if
the 762 rounds weren’t enough to
smear you with the scent of fetid
meat and attract every slophound

running through your veins This

youve jeopardized things like
dollars appropriated to our

your extraordinarily limited scope
of understanding that I seriously
question the wisdom of even
bringing it up But I do want to
say this so we’re both very very
clear because sometimes in

parties bandy about the
possibility of sentence reduction
in exchange for cooperation or
otherwise assisting the

so I could tell you personally
that you’re going to die in

comes when you start trying to be
my hero collaborator so hard I

have to slap you to shut up -- and
it will -- despite your pitiable
misguided Irish ‘Omerta’ -- when

your ‘code of silence’ gives way
to the fear of trafficking in
cigarettes to prevent sexual
enslavement -- I just want you to

Frawley spins away -- just in time Jem FIRES

ON DOUG

Jem heads for a crowded McDonalds a panicked grainy
voice SCREAMING at him on the Drive-Thru speaker

ON FRAWLEY

Shotgun to his shoulder He FIRES WIDE hitting a stand
of free Apartment Guides in front of Jem stopping him

and keeping him away from the McDonalds

Jem cuts back the other way as people stream out of
McDonald’s People are running in all directions

ON JEM

Holding the money bag as a shield now he crosses the
intersection where MORE COPS lie in wait A FLURRY of
rounds peck at his vest his leg his shooting arm

Cruisers scream to a halt on Boylston Police get out
Jem stutters GUNFIRE until he runs out of ammo He
throws it to the ground

He produces a Beretta and CONTINUES FIRING
Frawley returns fire hitting JEM in the HAND

FRAWLEY
On the ground FBI FBI

Jem raises his extra pistol in his bloody hand Frawley
squeezes one blast low -- BLAM

JEM FALLS BACK backpedaling until finally he falls off
the wet curb and drops hard onto the road back against a
MAILBOX

FRAWLEY
Coughlin Throw me your weapon

Doug looks back at him A sea of police officers
skulking behind cars holding weapons Bouncing brass
glass and distant sirens are the only sounds

FRAWLEY
Coughlin

JEM
All right

Jem sees a DISCARDED SODA dropped in the panic

JEM
One second

He strains to reach for it and finally grasping it he
takes a pull from the straw

He raises his empty weapon at the police who light him
up He SLUMPS to his seat Realizing he isn’t dead he
gets back up aiming the weapon again until a few SHOTS
FIND THEIR MARK the first at his jaw the second
snapping his head and releasing his life like a spring

The Police approach Jem and fire into what is clearly a
dead corpse Everyone wants to get their shot

indicates that Rusty should come in a hushed secretive

Prick

They start SHOOTING at one another
The feel should be of watching people shoot one another
on surveillance video wide detached and oddly

pedestrian

Doug has the clear advantage of a VEST and after five or
six shots Fergie BUCKLES and DROPS to the floor abruptly

Doug replaces his empty clip with a new one chambering a
round He opens his shirt and checks to see that the
VEST HAS SAVED HIM FROM SEVERAL HITS -- HE IS OKAY

He kneels next to Fergie who lies on the floor and puts
his gun in the florist’s CROTCH and looks him in the eye

DOUG
Fergie remember who it was that
clipped your nuts for you

BOOM --
