FADE IN FROM WHITE

INT UPSIDE RECOVERY CENTER HALLWAY -- DAY

An endless white hallway fades into a sterilized horizon
symmetrical rows of doors with silver locks flank a buffed
white tiled floor

But one door is open two suitcases wait outside

Then a third suitcase SLIDES into the hallway--its owner off
screen still in the room

WALT (0S)
The Romans used to call Yemen
Arabia Felix Means “Happy
Arabia”

BURNHAM (0S)
What’s that the Middle East

WALT (0OS)
And that’s the Romans They lived
in an age of decadence and to them
happiness was someplace else

EXT UPSIDE RECOVERY CENTER -- DAY

STAFFERS with eerie smiles as bleached and void-of-warmth as
their white uniforms and plastic name tags wave goodbye to

Renowned game show host WALT ERKINS (mid 40s) cell phone to
his ear as he descends the stairs

STAFFER
Congratulations again Walt

Walt spins around and mouths I’m on the phone

Walt has a healthy skin tone and weight of somebody newly
sober--paired with the fidgety anxiety of a restless child
INTERCUT WITH

INT AGENCY BURNHAM’S OFFICE -- DAY

BURNHAM (40s) his expensive suit flatters an average build
and his agent-speak flatters his insecure client Walt

Burnham cradles the phone between his neck and shoulder while
unravelling a green yoga mat on the floor but one end keeps
curling up

BURNHAM
The truth is hard for some But
not you

WALT

I’m walking out the same gates I
entered two months ago This
journey feels like a big U-turn
like I walked through a mirage

BURNHAM
You’re a hero now Show some heart

WALT
A hero to whom And all I’ve done
is pour my heart out

Walt paces the sidewalk A STAFFER appears at the top of the
stairs with his luggage she descends precariously

WALT
(shields his eyes)
God it’s bright out here Did you
find that address yet

BURNHAM
It’s in the Middle East can’t be
that hard You need to be thinking
about your presentation You have
less than an hour to get to the
hotel

WALT
I told you days ago--

BURNHAM
Walt it’s the biggest turn out
ever for this event in all its ten
years You’re proposing Friday
Maybe your top priority shouldnt
be to mail a letter to Nigeria
WALT
Yemen

BURNHAM
Did you rehearse enough

More newly-sober PEOPLE descend the stairs They shake
hands exchange hugs and pledges of continued support

Walt plugs his free ear and crosses the street
WALT
You only rehearse if you’re faking

something Never ask me that

Burnham fumbles with the yoga mat ironing out each rebelling
corner with his palm A framed poster behind him reads

Have you found your spine
PS Its not the thing youre sitting on

Accompanied with a diagram of a spine that resembles a
serpent winding up a man’s back

BURNHAM
Listen a car is coming for you
with a gentlemen inside who’ll be
profiling you okay A puff piece

WALT
(not listening)
Hm-mm
BURNHAM

And he knows not to ask about the
breakdown Mention it nothing

A BLACK TOWN CAR approaches from around the corner Walt
hurries to meet it The staffer with his baggage catches up

WALT
Hallie’s pulling up And she even
remembered tinted windows Youd
think she saw the ring already

BURNHAM
Hallie I said it was--

WALT
(sincere)
How do I look

BURNHAM
You--

Walt absently hangs up just as the staffers were old news
now a shinier object demands his attention

Walt tucks in his already tucked in dress shirt

WALT
(re luggage)
The trunk is fine

STAFFER
I need to give--

WALT
Thanks but I don’t need the
diploma or certificate-thing

The staffer CLOSES the trunk and hands Walt a SEALED
INTERNATIONAL ENVELOPE

STAFFER
This can’t get to Yemen without
you

WALT

(stunned beat)
Thanks A little something in my
room for everyone--dinner’s on me

Staffer smiles then turns and rolls her eyes

Walt waves at the car’s tinted windows opens the rear door
and--

INT LINCOLN TOWN CAR -- CONTINUOUS

CARTER SINCLAIR (20s) grins extends his hand Carter’s
argyle sweater and fitted slacks convey an image of contrived
sophistication

Carter also possesses the uncanny ability of transcribing
notes without having to look down at his notepad

CARTER
A simultaneous and equally
deserving welcome and congratul--

WALT
Whoa I apologize wrong car--
CARTER
Your agent set this up He was--

WALT
Right The fluffer I guess the
puff piece starts here

CARTER
(clears throat)
I’m merely here to observe and
gather insights for your comeback
profile

Walt is about to get in--but recoils

WALT
Comeback Who’s calling it that

CARTER
Mea culpa they’re calling it a
profile I inserted ‘comeback’ for
dramatic flair

Walt finally gets in they shake hands

Carter jots notes while maintaining the conversation with
alarming proficiency

CARTER (CONTD)
Carter Sinclair Think of me as
the well-dressed fly on the wall

Walt a bit frazzled collects himself and sees they’re not
moving He notices the DRIVER whose hands are ten-and-two on
the wheel ready for take off

Somehow Carter already has half a page worth of observations
and insights

WALT
(re the driver)
Who is he

CARTER
Ours And paid for

Walt reaches for his seat belt Carter watches Walt do this
and as soon as it CLICKS SECURELY--

CARTER
(to driver)
On to the hotel sir
(to Walt)
(MORE)
CARTER (CONTD)
And if you need to rehearse
please I’m not even here

CUT TO BLACK

TITLE “BLEACHED”
EXT THEATER BACK ALLEY -- DAY
NAD
I have never been more sure of
myself

NAD JARVIS a lithe looking mid-fifties television
personality plays host to a gaggle of REPORTERS

Nad takes a deep drag off a cigarette and exhales in the
reporter’s faces Their only discernible reaction is an
involuntary twitch of a random nose

REPORTER 1
What do you say to those who
describe your career as dead in the
water

NAD
Dump a body in a lake and it’1l
come bubbling back up

REPORTER 2
You’ve been slogging for--

NAD
I was dumped in a very deep lake

Nad exhales again--a red-tipped nose in back twitches

NAD (CONTD)
By the way I’1ll be a featured
speaker at this week’s--

REPORTER 3
Can you tell us what’s on tap for
Fridays show

NAD
(irritated)
Reality Optional host Walt Erkins
is joining me fresh from rehab
And with a very big surprise
REPORTER 1
Is is true your ex-wife will also
be a guest

NAD
Per the legal system she’s not my
ex yet Clarification for the--

REPORTER 2
Is Walt actually clean Will he
reveal what led to his breakdown

Nad exhales a final breath in three rapid bursts directing
an all-engrossing plume of smoke at the questioneers--
twitching a few beaks to his delight

NAD
Unfortunately I have to return to
my duties inside--

Reporters holster their notepads start dispersing

NAD (CONTD)
Although there is something

They light up pens and eyebrows raise in anticipation

NAD (CONTD)
I will be a featured speaker at
this week’s FPOA convention

But by the end of his sentence Nad is speaking to himself

INT THEATER BACK ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Nad steps inside sets the cigarette pack on a tiny shelf by
the door Scribbled on the wall above it In Case of Press
with an arrow pointing down to the shelf

Nad grabs a felt tip pen and amends the note to REQUIRED In
Case of Press

He checks his watch--with its wide band and large head it’s
an unmistakable signature piece of his a Nautic watch He
adjusts it as if it irritates him

NAD
(to his watch)
Can’t you lie to me just this once

A PRODUCER with a head-set and clipboard makes a beeline for
him They make haste down the hallway
PRODUCER
Third truckload of flowers just
arrived
NAD
Which color
PRODUCER
White
NAD

Which white

PRODUCER
Off-white Off-white sorry

NAD
Did you get a hold of Dally yet

PRODUCER
Not yet sir

NAD
If we can’t book my own wife for
Friday we’ll be an even bigger
joke than what’s being said--

They round a corner and are greeted by a well-oiled crew
constructing a fantasy wedding set on a sound stage

NAD
Now this is love

Nad is entranced losing himself in the myriad wedding
decorations white wreaths pearl balloon bunches bouquets
of all sizes etc

Nad unfolds a photograph from his pocket an image of a
wedding its likeness being replicated by his crew

PRODUCER
Enough to melt your heart sir

NAD
At least the sheet of ice over it

Nad winks at the producer then steps over around and
underneath the decorations verifying their placement against
his photo and does so with grace a ballet of sorts

Then stops to conduct the hanging of a giant wreath

NAD
Up up up Higher higher Stop
And disappears offstage

INT THEATER NAD’S OFFICE -- DAY
Nad stands at his window overlooking downtown Los Angeles

TOBIN (30s) enters Tobin’s gut extends beyond his comfort
zone--until he loosens up a belt notch or two

Tobin looks concerned but tries a positive spin

TOBIN
The set is looking outstanding
Walt is gonna flip

NAD
Do you find it ironic that the
dictionary can define happiness
but it can’t tell how you to get
it

TOBIN
You didn’t actually look in there
for that did you

NAD
Who cares if it’s a noun

Tobin looks over at Nad’s computer on screen is a blog
entitled A Lesbian Life In Yemen

Nad is still staring at the passing traffic

NAD
Dally left me because she got this
notion that I’m boring out of
adventures Her words

TOBIN
But you’ve done the same thing
every day for the last thirty
years You haven’t changed So
that leaves her

NAD
I told her that

TOBIN
She’s a bitch with a book You’re
on TV dummy What’d those
reporters say

NAD
Lots but I’m the last person
they want to know anything about

TOBIN
You just need to do something news
worthy again

NAD

Walt gets back into the press by
overdosing and coming out of rehab
And they call that heroic

(beat)
You know I walked down the street
the other day and not one young
person recognized me

TOBIN
They have to know who you are
first
(re Nad’s reaction)
But you still have an audience

NAD
Had Now I feel like I’m just a
vessel for trivia to pass through
I’m like an automatic door at the
super-market

TOBIN
Reliable Useful

NAD
Automated predictable Maybe
that’s why I haven’t done my own
shopping since Dally left shit

Nad clutches his watch like it bit him or was it a pain
down his left arm

Tobin looks worried as Nad adjusts his watch to a looser

TOBIN
Youre a TV host Nad All you’re
responsible for is what the camera
sees Smile up

Nad smirks blossoms into a full reassuring grin

CUT TO

INT TOWN CAR (CITY STREETS) -- DAY
Carter points to a passing billboard

Walt’s face (but not his smile) is partially obscured by the
new airtime for what’s touted as “THE BEST GAMESHOW PERIOD”

CARTER
That is a powerful smile Not many
could pull one off like that

Walt says nothing watches it pass with a sigh

Carter SNEEZES into his sleeve Again Walt says nothing but
lowers his window for a moment then raises it

Carter looks annoyed His eager-to-please front now dented

CARTER
Your show is--

WALT
I thought you were going to be a
fly on the wall

CARTER
Even flies make a buzzing noise

Walt starts scratching his knuckles instinctively the
comfort tic when you’re too old to suck your thumb

A low flying JETLINER gets Walt’s attention

CARTER
(clears throat)
Your show is lauded as innovative
in eschewing the standard five day
format of other game shows in
exchange for one two-hour live show
per week

Walt DIALS his cell Carter sees this as competition and
speaks faster

CARTER (CONT’D)
Your new season is airing on
Mondays instead of Tuesdays which
youve had your whole career Is
such a radical change a sign of
fading popularity and if so would
it be fair to say the dwindling
audience is due in part to a waning
genre of which you are the
figurehead of

WALT
The only day of the week I care
about is Saturday

INTERCUT WITH

INT AGENCY BURNHAM’S OFFICE -- DAY

Burnham is seated at his desk readjusting an ice pack on his
lower back while TYPING furiously reaches for his phone

An eager young ASSISTANT is on his knees picking up shredded
pieces of the green yoga mat from earlier

BURNHAM INTO PHONE
How’s my favorite--

WALT
I’ve been out of rehab for twenty-
two minutes and still no call from
Courtland Skies congratulating me
How would it look if I suddenly
lost this endorsement deal

A car full of LAUGHING HAPPY-SEEMING PEOPLE drives alongside
Walt He stares a moment then looks away plugs his ear

Carter JOTS something down

BURNHAM
They’ve been sponsoring you your
entire career Walt--you’re gold
Although I have been receiving a
ton of interest from lots of
exciting new companies--

WALT
I don’t want other endorsement
deals Nad Jarvis has Nautic
Watches sponsoring him

BURNHAM
Nautic is not what they used to be--

WALT
Courtland Skies is an association I
will not give up It’s defined me
for as long as I and most can
remember

BURNHAM
Smile up stay focused Hard
part’s over You at the Hyatt yet

Walt watches the JETLINER fly out of sight

INT HYATT REGENCY LOBBY -- DAY

Beyond lavish beyond ostentatious Where cash drips off
the decor and delusions wax the floor

As enormous banners trumpet the event

WELCOME FUTURE PERSONALITIES OF AMERICA
Tenth Annual FPOA Convention

PUZZLED PEOPLE masquerading as said “Future Personalities”
flash their lanyards to a SECURITY GUARD at a ballroom door

VAL (40s) sprightly aura of a weather girl awaits entry

VAL
Am I too late for Walt Erkins

SECURITY
It’s a packed house you might get
lucky

CUT TO

INT HYATT REGENCY BALLROOM -- DAY

The EAGER EYES and STRETCHED SMILES of hundreds of aspiring
male and female personalities soaking in Walt’s sermon

In the very back row Val stares with rapt attention

WALT
Plastic is the most malleable
sustainable substance on earth
But perhaps most remarkable is
that plastic will outlive us all
That’s right We--you and I--are
mere shooting stars in the sky of
this plastic universe So let’s
learn what we can Because like
all stars we began dying the day
we were born

Walt paces the stage contemplatively this is his domain

Behind him reads THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING PLASTIC Or How I
Learned To Stop Worrying and Start Resonating

WALT (CONT’D)
F Scott Fitzgerald famously
declared “there are no second acts
in American lives” To which I say
Sure F but some of us are sailing
right along on our first
resonating with every minute of it

Walt brings up a slide on the Big Brother-like screen above
SLIDE A water bottle bobbing along the vast ocean blue

WALT (CONT’D)
This plastic bottle is estimated to
have been thrown away some thirty
years ago Still here Still
intact That’s called tenacity

Val opens a Moleskine transcribes diligently Carter also
in back looks on with doubt

SLIDE A baby seal caught in the plastic rings of a six-pack

WALT (CONTD)

Small weak animals stuck in
plastic Sad Frequently But
this illustrates just how brutal
the competition is Whether you
want to use your personality to
become the next Fortune 500 CEO a
television host or simply a more
vital person--remember plastic

(beat)
Why It rose to prominence in the
50s and every piece of plastic that
ever was here still is here Sure
plastic can change adapt but
its soul remains intact

Walt’s eyes scan the back row falls on Val’s section

WALT (CONTD)
Many of you know I just completed
rehab treatment but my personality
remains unscathed And so does my
relationship with premium brands
like Courtland Skies

(beat)

Change without compromise

Val’s face flushes Walt pretends to hear something offstage

WALT (CONTD)
What’s that “Oh but Walt What
about all the natural elements
already found on Earth Why can’t
we be like those”
(next slide)
Let’s break them down Water It’s
all over the place No
consistency Some model that is
(next slide)
Trees Bold phalluses of the
Earth Sounds strong Virile
Don’t get fooled stay alert It’s
not a coincidence that people who
can’t form a strong bond are called
wooden

The audience LAUGHS Val among them

LAST SLIDE A close-up of the same sad looking baby seal
caught in plastic

WALT’S REFLECTION as he washes his face at the marble sink
WALT (0S)
-Who looks like the quitter in

this picture

SPLASHES his face again His aged reflection sizing him up

INT HYATT REGENCY HOTEL SUITE -- CONTINUOUS

Walt TURNS on the light and JUMPS at the sight of Val waiting
in his bed Her heels on the floor beside her

WALT
How the hell did you get in here

VAL
Tenacity

WALT
No no out Let’s go

VAL
Not up for a little fun

WALT

I’m getting engaged in three days
VAL

Then why isn’t she in here with

you

Walt’s eyes can’t help but trace the contours of her body
beneath the silk sheets

VAL (CONT’D)
Hell of a presentation you gave
Mr Host Come on I want you
resonating inside me

Fighting every urge to bite the forbidden fruit Walt walks
over to the door UNLOCKS it

Val begrudgingly gets out of bed gets dressed
VAL

Trying to be a good man to your
future wife

WALT
That’s right

VAL

How long you been with her
WALT

Five years
VAL

One of my girlfriends fucked you
two years ago Asshole

She SLAMS the door on her way out Walt sighs it’s probably
true

Walt looks at the now unmade bed where she was then sits
at a table overlooking the balcony and twinkling LA skyline

Walt runs his hand along the tabletop it’s made of wood
or is it imitation wood

Walt KNOCKS on it a few times Listens closely

CUT TO

INT HYATT REGENCY SKY BAR -- CONTINUOUS

A moody midnight bar that provides patrons with the kind of
lighting and view that makes one feel a little less lonely

Nad sits with DALLY (40s) A BARTENDER brings their tab

Dally’s much-envied mid-forties figure is guarded by the
disarmament her piercing eyes inflict on the weak but said
eyes are hidden behind bold designer sunglasses

BARTENDER
Good to see you both

NAD
Thanks Frank

TWO PEOPLE push by Nad and take the adjacent bar seats

NAD
Don’t stay here Come back home

DALLY
It’s not my home anymore

NAD
It’s not a home at all if one
person’s living in it Please

DALLY
There’s a lot going on outside your
own little world Naddy

NAD
I’m starting to realize that

Nad attempts to take off her sunglasses She leans back
DALLY
Uh-uh I’m sponsored now Gotta
look like my author photo
The two people look over at Nad it’s Walt and Carter
Walt and Nad exchange a glare Walt starts to speak--
NAD
(interrupts)

Save it for Fridays show

Nad storms off in a huff Dally reaches for her drink
nearly knocks it over--lifts her sunglasses then grabs it

WALT
(re Carter’s look)
It’s bad luck for the guest and
host to talk before a show

The bartender sets down two glasses for Walt Carter eyes
Walt as he raises a glass of gin to his nose but sips only
the tonic

Walt reads a blog on his phone entitled A Lesbian Life In
Yemen the same one on Nad’s computer

Carter looks over his shoulder but Walt quickly closes it
attempts to draw Carter’s attention elsewhere

CARTER
What was that on your--

WALT
(re his two glasses)
Pills weaken your stomach lining
I never had a drinking problem so

Carter nods like it’s no big deal Flips his notepad open

CARTER
That was some presentation earlier

WALT
I don’t want to talk about that
In fact let’s tilt the spotlight
Tell me about yourself

CARTER
Okay um I’m a Francophile

Walt immediately regrets inviting this type of conversation
He stares into his glass of gin

WALT
So you love hotdogs
CARTER
What
WALT
Francophile Frankfurter
CARTER

Somebody with a deep admiration for
all things French Culture food

WALT
France-ophile Jesus Okay
Alright so what makes you that
CARTER

Well I think we all have a country
in our heart Some are part Roman
Parisian Japanese

WALT
Don’t you have to live there to be
that

CARTER
You just have to love it Hence
the word

WALT

Gotcha And you love France

CARTER
I love France

WALT
Any particular reason I’ve never
been I can’t stand cigarettes

CARTER
I’ve never been either though I
hope to go one day It’s more a
spiritual connection now

Framed photographs of Nad and Dally from years past are
throughout the room Nad looks exactly the same in each
picture while Dally’s expressions grow more wistful aloof

Nad turns each one around his nightly ritual

NAD
Good night Dal

Nad appears out of place in the opulence of his own room
Like an old dusty museum piece in need of a proper curator

Nad slips into bed and brings up the blog A Lesbian Life in
Yemen on his phone Begins reading in the dark

NOTE Ahdia speaks in an ArabicEnglish dialect with a
vigorous tone

AHDIA (VO)
“Bazaar Slang” posted on 25 August
Today marks the fifth day in a row
we were called “tiffs” Walking
through the bazaar hand-in-hand
with Nazirah again prompted so many
closed-minded locals to yell slurs
at us Always the derogatory names
most of us first hear in our early
teens

INT HYATT REGENCY SUITE -- NIGHT

Walt uses the pull-out couch as a bed the rustled sheets
that Val contaminated on the actual bed haven’t been touched

Walt reads the same blog on his phone in the dark

Nad struts the stage demonstrating a formidable amount of
confidence before a packed house A banner reads

“Personalities as Products Products as People”

Unlike Walt Nad doesn’t need a sideshow--his personality is
everything

NAD
There is a host inside all of you
A host is a personality at its
peak A personality turned to
eleven It can take you to
television like it did myself it
can take you to the head of a
Fortune 500 company it can even
take you to the moon

Walt and Carter crack a door in back peek inside

NAD (CONTD)

astronauts to the lunar surface
but only one took that first step
Neil Armstrong asserted himself
wielding his fuckin’ personality
like a weapon to be first

CRICKETS from the audience Nad smiles he’s killing

WALT

CARTER
Look at ‘em all

The audience is mesmerized nobody is taking notes because
nobody can move Nad wipes sweat from his brow

NAD

just told you to have a nice day
Host That server you think likes
you but won’t see you outside the
restaurant Host Your wife when
she says till death do you part
Fuckin’ host

(goes for the kill)
You when you tell your spouse how
amazing she looks in that
unflattering outfit That was you
being a host Amateur moments
Maybe But multiply all those
micro-encounters by a million
and that’s the difference That’s
what I do I’ma host

INT HYATT REGENCY HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

Walt closes the door to the ballroom which has now EXPLODED
INTO APPLAUSE

WALT

We both started young I’ve always
looked to him as sort of a model
for this kind of racket

CARTER
Some people think you’re better
That you’ve surpassed him

WALT
I’m in game shows I’11 always be
in game shows Him he has guests
every night monologues full of
jokes presidential candidates I
get interrupted by a buzzer

CARTER
He had all that you mean

Carter starts to jot something down but Walt stops him

WALT

That was off the record
CARTER

But-—-
WALT

That’s why he gets the big brands
But he’s still a prick

Walt worried he forgot something starts patting his suit

CARTER
You gotta fill me in on that brand
thing I was in the bathroom and
these two guys at the urinal were
arguing over what brand they hope
to endorse

WALT
Some find companies easier to get
along with than people

CARTER
They looked nineteen

Carter sees Walt frantically searching his pockets then the
floor

Walt takes off running down the hall

Walt rushes inside sweating He scans the room sees a MAID
changing out the towels in the bathroom

Carter is right behind him taking frantic notes
WALT

Did you see uh Hey did you
find a letter An envelope
The maid folds a towel shrugs

MAID
Sorry

Walt checks all the dresser drawers the night stand
Walt pulls out the couch-bed His letter to Yemen falls out

WALT
Thank God

Walt grabs it irons out the folded edges Places it
securely inside his suit coat

CARTER
What was that

WALT
(to maid)
And can I get new bed sheets
The maid stares at him blankly
WALT
New bed--

Any Spanish in your heart

Carter shakes his head Walt holds up the bed sheets

WALT
New these please

The maid smiles in recognition

My letter to Yemen
CARTER
To who

WALT

CARTER

Felix

Walt sizes Carter up decides he’s harmless enough
the letter from his inner suit-pocket

WALT
Has to do with an online journal I
started reading during treatment

CARTER

Reading it got kinda addictive
This girl Ahdia chronicles her
life as a lesbian in an oppressive

CARTER
No nothing This is good

Carter’s notepad with apprehension Calls the

WALT
Well don’t make it about that

CARTER
Can I--

Carter reaches for the letter--but Walt moves it

WALT
In treatment we had to write a
letter to a hero or the closest we
could find And then mail ‘em

CARTER
Why some lesbian in Yemen

WALT
(chuckles)
She’1l never read it

Carter looks at Walt not buying his response They step
onto the elevator Walt brings up the blog on his phone

CARTER
You know you bypassed an entire
country of heroes

WALT
Here or in France

CARTER
I can think of at least four I’d
send mine to

WALT
Fuck up first and then count how
many

Carter appears perplexed starts to speak but stops

APPLAUSE from earlier He looks at Tobin with red eyes

NAD
A good round of applause can
be better than sex

Tobin pats his back--seems at ease that his boss is back in
high spirits Nad rewinds the tape plays the APPLAUSE again

TOBIN
(smirks )
Oh and Buzz Aldrin’s people
called Insulted that you would
have the gull to belittle the
accomplishment of an American hero

Nad smiles a genuine grin

NAD
Guess whose people didn’t call
There can only be one
(beat)
And I owe it all--

Tobin lifts his chin up expecting praise

NAD
--to someone I’ve never even met
Somebody daring enough to let me
get to know her without feeling
the need to know me in return

TOBIN
Sir

NAD
I’ve forgotten what it’s like to be
on the other side It’s thrilling
to be an anonymous observer

Tobin looks distressed as he puts two-and-two together

TOBIN
That gay broad isn’t it

NAD
Don’t call her that Wait you
read her too

TOBIN
You have the damn thing up all the
time Though God knows why

Nad turns on his computer monitor the blog is up He
casually refreshes the page

NAD
Because there’s more going on than
just what the camera sees

TOBIN
Not in your life there isn’t

Nad’s jaw drops as a new post catches his attention

NAZIRAH (VO)
“ALERT The True Cost of Bread” I
am Nazirah I haven’t seen my
lover Ahdia in three days and
fear she has been kidnapped by
armed security forces

NAZIRAH (VO) (CONTD)
Her home was left a wreck her door
ripped off its hinges her window
shattered--a ransom note left
behind

INT TOWN CAR (CITY STREETS) -- DAY

Walt is looking over Carter’s shoulder at his phone Walt’s
anxious his letter to Yemen clenched in his hand

NAZIRAH (VO)
Her captors have not identified
themselves but it is clear The
government considers her a threat
to the stability and order of the
country Her blog is illegal and
they want her silenced They are
asking for a large sum of money to
be delivered to an address ina
remote location if I ever want to
see her again More to come

WALT
I told you there’s an uprising
going on It’s dog-eat-dog

CARTER
(beat)
You were right She’ll never read
it
Walt looks down at his letter distressed

WALT
I never thanked her

CARTER
She never knew you

The town car SCREECHES to a halt as an SUV cuts it off--their
driver YELLS in an obscure language

Carter leans against the window scribbles down the
offenders license plate

Walt is oblivious as he absorbs all this
WALT
(sotto)
How am I going to find you Ahdia

As if on cue Walt’s CELL rings

INTERCUT WITH

INT AGENCY BURNHAM’S OFFICE -- DAY

Burnham is on the phone at his computer The framed poster
of the serpent spine on the wall is now crooked

WALT
Uncanny timing Something
startling just happened

BURNHAM
Then youve heard We need to get
aggressive Courtland Skies is
grounding you

This jars Walt back to reality

WALT
Hold on what You said I was gold

BURNHAM
You are They don’t value gold
anymore Blind mother--

WALT
Why the hell did I get sober then
I can do everything else high

BURNHAM
Have a little more respect for
yourself

WALT

That new CEO hates me Harvey
wouldn’t have let this happen

BURNHAM
The tooth paste people are excited
to meet with you

WALT
The who It’s dog-eat-dog in Yemen
and you want me to endorse
something disposable

BURNHAM
Something universal Forget about
that place I’m sure a lot of
folks over there are starving but
you can take comfort in knowing
this is a major loss for you too

Walt wistfully stares out the tinted window again Obnoxious
billboards of all sizes and products sweep the landscape

WALT
They didn’t even call me

BURNHAM
And where are you You have a
signing at the Hyatt with Nad

WALT
Was on my to Courtland to talk to
the couriers about my letter--

BURNHAM
Worry about what the camera sees
Walt Who’s on camera Hm

WALT
(sighs)
I am

BURNHAM
And what do you see when you stare
directly into the lens

WALT
Vague outline of my reflection

BURNHAM
Thank you

Burnham CLICKS OFF Walt sighs conflicted

CARTER
Next U-turn driver Back to the
Hyatt

WALT

No no Make a left up here anyway

They take the next corner and Courtland Skies imposing
headquarters slides into view

CARTER
What are you doing Your agent--

WALT
Having more respect for myself
I think

The town car stops at a red-light and Walt LEAPS out of the
car onto the street

EXT LOS ANGELES STREETS -- CONTINUOUS

Walt shields his eyes from the blinding rays of the sun as he
bumbles through traffic Cars SWERVE and SKID to a stop

Walt finally makes it to the sidewalk a la Frogger a bit
disheveled and looking surprised he actually did it

More CAR HORNS and SKIDDING get his attention and he sees
Carter less gracefully dodging traffic notepad in hand

The town car driver is mortified and YELLS in his native
tongue holding up traffic in his own lane

CARTER
Shoot

Carter nearly there extends his hand Walt pulls him to
safety Walt can’t help but smirk

WALT
All this for a puff piece

CARTER
(out of breath)
All this for an airline company

Walt heads inside with Carter in tow

Tobin is pacing back and fourth loosens his belt a notch
Nad is rereading the latest blog post solemn-faced

TOBIN
You don’t know her You’ve never
been further than New York City
It’s been ages since you’ve been on
the 405

NAD
That’s why this is so perplexing

TOBIN
You’re going to be late for your
signing

NAD
I have to find her Somehow

TOBIN
Why

NAD
Look how intense just her
personality is how vividly she
comes across Imagine what she’11l
be like in person or on
television

TOBIN
You have a wife who has fallen out
of love with you--

NAD
And this is how Ill win her back
I havent forgotten what it was
like to have astronauts presidents
on my show but Ahdia may have
the most complete personality I’ve
ever encountered

TOBIN
That’s how you’ll get Dally back

NAD
That’s right

TOBIN
Do you hear yourself What’s your
plan Start down Wilshire
Boulevard for clues Fly to the
Middle-East armed with charisma

Nad walks over to his globe takes a moment to locate Yemen
Then “walks” back to Los Angeles two fingers at a time

NAD
This girl could do anything Tobin
They kidnapped her Why Just for
being her
(beat)
I don’t know what I’m going to do
yet

TOBIN
Sir when I was hired you told me
that I might be joining a sinking
ship but it was my job to keep it
at least pointed in the right
direction Was it not

Nad smiles rotates his autograph-signing wrist Tobin
arches his back winces at a pain in his lower spine

Well unfurl the sails because
were picking up wind

INT COURTLAND SKIES HEADQUARTERS LOBBY -- DAY

An expansive five-star hotel-like lobby with relaxing hues of
gold and baby blue

A theater screen looms above playing a masturbatory montage
of in-flight luxury people sipping on highballs attractive
couples sleeping with warm padded neck-pillows etc

A LIVE PIANIST plays a JAZZ NUMBER in the waiting area

CARTER
Whoa

Walt looks at Carter I told you

WALT
Id come in here after a stressful
day and just hide out in the lobby
(savoring it)
Like one of those secret forts
you’d make as a kid

Walt and Carter approach reception A banner above reads
Giving The Sky Its Signature Look Since 1965

RECEPTIONIST
How may I help you reach your
target destination sir

WALT
A ticket to Dillard Stanton’s
office please

The receptionist recognizes Walt

RECEPTIONIST
Oh I’m afraid there aren’t any
flights departing from the lobby--

WALT
Cut the metaphor and call whoever
you need to call Where’s Harvey
Forrest I’m not leaving

RECEPTIONIST
Harvey isn’t exactly

Get on the horn

Walt starts scratching his now-raw knuckles Carter is
taking copious notes

The receptionist reluctantly picks up the phone

INT COURTLAND SKIES HQ SEVENTH FLOOR -- DAY

Walt steps off the elevator and is immediately struck in the
neck by a paper airplane

Walt opens his mouth wide in pain but doesn’t make a sound
A SOUR EMPLOYEE runs up
SOUR EMPLOYEE

model Cutting costs

Carter CHUCKLES

Walt grabs the paper plane out of his collar CRUMBLES it up
and marches forward

WALT
Where’s Harvey Forrest

SOUR EMPLOYEE
Moved to the corner

WALT
Corner office

SOUR EMPLOYEE
He’s unable to take visitors

Frustrated Walt notices a packed conference room takes off
in that direction
INT COURTLAND SKIES HQ CONFERENCE ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
DILLARD STANTON distinguished mid-fifties charms the room
DILLARD
-And we take pride in our

diversity in the workplace and
consistency in the airspace

All the EXECS are entranced Dillard’s personality is mighty

Walt and Carter peer in through the glass window Walt tries
the door handle locked Dillard recognizes him

DILLARD
Must be filing a complaint A tad
too much baggage for one flight

The room LAUGHS in unison like an eerie applause Dillard
opens the double oak doors

DILLARD (CONTD)
The man whose smile endorsed our
sky for many years I don’t think
weve been formally introduced

WALT
We havent

Dillard looks at Carter assuming Walt will introduce him but
he doesn’t

WALT (CONTD)
There’s a rumor we’re no longer
sharing skies

DILLARD
Rumor It’s been official for over

an hour now

Walt suddenly notices the execs in the room but keeps going

WALT
Just like that I started hosting
Reality Optional at twenty-one
I’m in record books If you
recall it was a very big deal--

DILLARD
Back then it was

WALT
And since that very first season
you--all of you--have been a proud
sponsor For every year since

Walt literally starts to tear up Dillard is unfazed

WALT (CONTD)
I was a kid I felt like I had
been shot out of a canon but CS
was always looking out never gonna
let me disgrace the family

DILLARD
You managed to find a way

WALT
You can’t just walk out when times
are tough What if we all did that

Amazingly Dillard chokes up a bit--though one can’t be sure

DILLARD
This is a new era Walt No longer
will the success of products rely
on the endorsements of the
prominent ones the well-knowners
whose turbulent lifestyles so often
countervail the values we work to
instill in our brand

WALT
You need people Products need
personalities

DILLARD

Not in my vision The company the
brand assumes a life of its own--
which in turn makes it a person
thereby validating itself

(beat)
Thats why people work for
companies Walt Individually
we’re flawed but together we can
fly That’s why it doesn’t make
sense for us to rely on one
personality anymore no matter how
strong it thinks it is

Dillard stares down Walt

Walt looks around at the execs’ vacant faces who seem to be
agreeing if only by default--not unlike the corporatized
expressions of the staffers at the rehab center

WALT
If you start calling yourselves
people what are we supposed to do

DILLARD
Buy a ticket and fly with us
INT COURTLAND SKIES HQ ELEVATOR FOYER -- DAY

Walt and Carter approach the elevators The sour employee
walks past them with a stack of papers glares at Walt

SOUR EMPLOYEE
Enjoy your descent

Walt pretends to step on the elevator and as soon as the
employee is out of sight returns to the floor

WALT
Follow me

CARTER
What are we doing

Walt crouches down low moving clumsily along a cubicle
wall a child playing espionage

Carter sighs follows suit

They zigzag along undetected from one support column to
another

Just as they approach a corner Walt motions to stop
TWO LAWYERS hurry by oblivious

LAWYER 1
They always get more when--

LAWYER 2

With Harvey in sight Walt and Carter sprint to--

prominent and sturdy spine hunches over a small desk
meticulously folding paper airplanes

HARVEY
Craft Craft

Harvey folds over a paper wing Licks his finger for a
precise crease

HARVEY
-And pride

Admires his finished plane then sends it flying in a random
direction

Walt and Carter duck as a plane soars overhead Harvey
starts a new one

SOUR EMPLOYEE
Mr Forrest here are the raw
materials you requested

HARVEY
Attention to detail

Harvey gives them a once over and nods

Walt is in a state of shock as he notices the same absence in
Harvey’s expression as the execs in the boardroom

WALT
Is this some sort of joke

SOUR EMPLOYEE
What are you-- Fine You wanted
the truth here he is

WALT
What happened

SOUR EMPLOYEE
He believed in change without
compromise Still does apparently

WALT
Harvey it’s me It’s Wally

Walt is deeply disturbed watching Harvey in what’s clearly
not a corner office merely a corner Pushed off forgotten

Walt looks in the direction of the conference room where
Dillard is now clearly wiping away a tear as he gestures
wildly sermon-like to the nodding executives

WALT
(to Carter)
He used to be upright Or was
it always like this

Carter doesn’t know what to say

WALT (CONT’D)
You ever fuck around with drugs
Carter

CARTER
(red-faced)
Not really

WALT
So this looks normal to you

Carter is at a loss as another plane soars overhead

INT COURTLAND SKIES HQ ELEVATOR -- DAY

Walt and Carter take the elevator back down Walt scratches
his knuckles and stares at his Yemen letter defeated

Carter is busy on his smartphone shakes his head

CARTER
Can’t trust any institution that
has to pay rent

WALT
You know everything

Carter pauses as though considering it

CARTER
I hope not I have a whole lot of
years left they’d be pretty boring
if I never learned anything new

This catches Walt off-guard but serves only to annoy him at
how correct that sounded

WALT
Don’t write about Harvey I’11
have your job if you do

CARTER
Somebody beat me to it Weeks ago

Carter hands over his phone Walt skims a news article

WALT
His wife How did I not

CARTER
They’re doing the guy a favor

Says he was the brains she was the
personality

INT COURTLAND SKIES HQ LOBBY -- CONTINUOUS

WALT
Id sit in here waiting for the

Dexterol to kick in Id spy on

CARTER
You’d get high in here

WALT
I did it to soar Just to be a
viewer is nice

Walt falls in a stuffed chair gets swept up in nostalgia

Outside PEOPLE on their phones hurriedly pass Some pause
to check their reflections but take their next few steps
even faster as if making up for lost time

Walt’s smile fades not offering the same high it once did

Carter picks up a magazine off a glass table The Cumulus
Quarterly with Walt on the cover beaming at a shimmering CS
plane on his shoulder the good angel

A headline reads Frequent flyer Walt Erkins reveals his must-
haves for the sybaritic traveller

CARTER
“Which champagne tastes best at
30000 feet” You know that

WALT
I used to think stuff like that was
important

CARTER
Can I ask if you’re nervous
about the proposal tomorrow

Walt TIGHTENS his grip on his letter

WALT
If I’m jumpy it’s because a hero of
mine was just kidnapped

CARTER
I’d like to ask Hallie some
questions for the profile

WALT
It’s puff Make something nice up

AUTOGRAPH SEEKERS form two massive lines for their chance to
see Walt and Nad wield their Sharpies like pros

Walt looks over at Nad who is clearly enjoying himself
laughing with fans and posing for pictures

Walt sighs couldn’t fake it if he tried A MOTHER holding
her CHILD is next

MOTHER
Hi Can you please sign this

WALT
Happy to

Trembling with excitement she hands him a Courtland Skies
advertisement of Walt snoring while soaring in a company
plane captioned with Youll pray for a delay

BABY

WALT
(forces a chuckle)
Teach your son those words

MOTHER
You did He’s been saying them
since yesterday

She nuzzles her baby The baby smiles

MOTHER (CONTD)
Look how happy he is Do you ever
get tired of smiling Mr Erkins

CAMERA FLASHES reflect into Walt’s eyes from Nad’s table

WALT
(wincing)
Been at this nearly two decades
Feels like I’m always smiling

MOTHER
A gift

WALT
No emotion required No energy
(smiles convincingly)
It’s a muscle

The mother checks her baby concerned

MOTHER
How so

WALT

Smiling is the most shallow form of
displaying happiness It’s not
associated with what’s going on in
here

(taps his heart)
Two different sets of muscles
control them two wildly different
motivations inform them

MOTHER
Wh-what are you saying My baby
isn’t happy

WALT
I’m saying that’s the point I
don’t know him How would I know
(beat)

On second thought take the smile
at face value Stare at one too
closely and you’1l realize most
people have awful teeth

looked depressed earlier

WALT
You believe I would do that

Yes because there’s another report
that you told her it had awful
teeth That’s the one I’m choosing
not to believe

Walt crouches down in a quiet corner plugs his free ear

WALT
I’m not dealing with this Burnham
You said if I got sober I’d be in

it’s slipping away

Walt listens to a presentation given by BINNDER JORDAN (50s)
wiry body frame and wispy gray hair His assistant LEE
(20s) sits with his hands underneath the table

In the center are two small objects covered by black cloths

Carter is in the far back corner taking notes Behind him is
a bland corporate logo STOCKTON TOOTHPASTE Why Change

BINNDER
Simplicity in oral care Where
some see gingivitis we see
opportunity Where others see
cavities we see a hole-lotta
possibilities

Carter rolls his eyes Walt is TAPPING impatiently

BINNDER
But self-awareness is important so
we asked ourselves What is wrong
with Stockton Toothpaste today

Binnder waits for an answer Walt lifts his hands in a weak
surrender

BINNDER
Exactly Nothing It’s literally
all it can be and so are you

Binnder winks at LEE Taking his cue Lee removes a small
firecracker lights it and tosses it on the table It
CRACKLES like a Wild West shoot-out

Walt is STARTLED knees the table The second clothed object
TOPPLES OVER Lee sets it upright

Binnder dramatically removes the first cloth to reveal a
large set of dentures

BINNDER
Given your history of abuse Walt
your rehab--and now your daily
struggle to stay clean You’re the
living embodiment of our industry

Lee takes out another firecracker gets ready to light it
Walt looks uneasy

BINNDER
A universality to all things
nature people plastic But as
you say only one of these lasts
forever Pair yourself wisely

Walt watches Lee light another CRACKLER

WALT
(realizes)
Plastic lives on because it
can’t die

Unable to hear over the CRACKLING Binnder gives Walt a
thumps up with a brighter whiter smile

Binder whisks away the second cloth revealing a mirror--now
reflecting a CRACKED IMAGE of Walt

BINNDER
Remember Walt tomorrow is one
giant cavity waiting to be filled

Walt stares at his fragmented reflection as the air fills
with a POP POP POP

Thank you sir

BARTENDER
Frank Call a bartender by name or

Carter looks at the menu intimidated

The lights dim SCATTERED APPLAUSE as a karaoke singer
steps on stage though it isn’t clear who it is yet

The opening strings play for Frank Sinatra’s Youre Nobody
Till Somebody Loves You

MALE VOICE (0S)
Youre nobody till somebody loves
you Youre nobody till somebody
cares The world is the same you
wont change it As sure as the
stars shine above

The menu could be in braille until Carter spots a French
wine he knows nothing about

CARTER
I‘ll uh the Bordeaux Frank

Recognizing the singer’s voice Carter turns around and sees
Nad on stage giving ol’ Blue Eyes a run for his money

Frank slides Carter his Bordeaux

BARTENDER
You know who that is

Carter nods quickly eager to please the bartender

CARTER

WALT

Carter fumbles around through his papers Walt grows
impatient

Carter stops looks at Walt

Tobin JUMPS

Jesus Nad What do you mean what
stage

NAD

You’re nobody till somebody loves
you But if you got nobody you
can love yourself and work outward

Nad enters though there’s something slightly off about his
appearance

TOBIN
I missed your karaoke
(beat)
Wait Did you re-part you hair

NAD
Yes and something occurred to me
We only know about Ahdia’s
kidnapping because of her lover
She paired herself wisely

Nad RUNS his hand through his hair then again to fix it
For the first time Nad is not sporting his Nautic watch

TOBIN (CONTD)
Your watch it’s--

NAD
Too tight

TOBIN
Try a looser setting

NAD
That’s not what I mean If I can’t
move forward Ill at least rebuild
myself at my peak and try again

TOBIN
You’ve done the same thing for
thirty years When was your peak

Nad removes the bw photograph of the wedding set from his
pocket He unfolds it completely to reveal it’s of him and
Dally years prior

With his hair in fact parted the way it is now

NAD
Somewhere along the way I re-parted
my hair my life Somewhere I
interpreted the opposite as normal

TOBIN
You’re having a breakdown

NAD
I’m emerging from one If I come
out and my hair is re-parted
America will gasp Small changes
lead to big things

serious change than with a million
tiny sparks Bring that list and

shelves anxiously hostage to their shopping lists

TOBIN
I can get what we need you
shouldn’t be out this late Walt’s
proposing tomorrow night Your own
wife hasn’t even guaranteed she’1ll
be on and--

NAD
That’s only because she’ll barely
talk to me

TOBIN

You shouldn’t have taken off your
watch I think it was holding you
together more than you think

NAD
-Ahdia was kidnapped We’re all
hostages to our own vices but to
someone else’s That’s tragedy
Like the lifespan of a fruit

Nad and Tobin wander in the fresh produce section Nad
examines a red apple

NAD
Its purpose clearly defined
alongside the others on its tree
Only to get intercepted by humans
at their peak Tragic

Nad BITES into the apple Tobin checks his watch

TOBIN
Maybe its purpose is to serve our
needs Our hunger What happens
if it goes unpicked

NAD
It thrives

TOBIN

Nad stops chewing stares at his apple Tobin bites his lip

TOBIN
I think you should know something
about your little Arabic concubine

Right okay So there’s only like
eleven more questions I have--

WALT
No no That’s where she is
where the kidnappers want the money
dropped off

know at an early age What you
don’t know is that the world
expects you to grow up straight
You’re allowed to know but not
allowed to tell if that’s not

Indeed Slight change of plans

Walt hands Carter the LOS ANGELES ADDRESS on hotel

CARTER
No no Walt we can’t

WALT

life to change

Go to this new address

Walt hands the address to the driver

CARTER
You’re proposing tonight okay

CARTER
It’s a puff piece Profiling your
proposal on Nad’s show tonight

Carter looks at Walt react with childlike sincerity and wide-
eyed anticipation as the town car TAKES OFF

What if it’s all a big
disappointment

INT THEATER NAD’S OFFICE -- DAY

Nad is watching a YouTube video feed of Dally being
interviewed by REPORTERS in her sunglasses of course

Uploaded only a few minutes ago We see Ahdia’s blog open in
another page behind this one

DALLY
Modern Oddities is a book of essays
about the absurdities in
contemporary urban life Sadly
in these times we place value in
people making no sense at all
while the person wishing to offer
their two cents is deemed an
elitist The two-cent mind-set is
now the one-percent Beware my
darlings

REPORTER 1
We hear there’s going to be a
chapter on people who host
television shows and how to survive
a marriage long enough to get
divorced and--

DALLY
--and still retain your sanity
Yes I heard that rumor as well I
don’t mind the singing in the
shower it’s the crying I can’t
bear

Nad asks questions taking Dally’s answers as if they were
addressed to him

REPORTER 1 NAD
Your books are always mired Won’t you continue to love
in controversy Is that me
planned
DALLY
(winks )

Oh yes Always I’d also like to
announce that this is the first
book Ill be publishing without my
former surname “Jarvis” Just
Dally

Dally presents the cover a close-up of her face and bold
sunglasses

REPORTER 1 NAD
With your prolific work rate But you regret dropping
surely you can give us a clue “Jarvis” don’t you Dal

as to what trends or urban
crazes youll skewer next

DALLY
I’m afraid you’1ll have to wait and
see
REPORTER 1 NAD
Can you at least divulge the People that are made for each
concept other can be unmade by each
other You’1l come back to
me right

colleagues clear the stage

WALT
(addressing camera)
Sorry about that we’re live folks

they’re buffing these floors with
the same stuff Dick’s using on his
head

A BALD PRODUCER in the corner blushes shrugs at the
audience They LAUGH back on track

haven’t seen before He moves with grace to his podium

APPLAUSE
CONTESTANT 1

distracted obvious he doesn’t want to see what’s playing

cockpit but misses the lower plane and falls out of frame

Walt left shaken by the images on screen slowly turns the
card over fearing the answer

WALT

wobble his legs jelly COLLAPSES again

PRODUCER

Instant pandemonium The STAFF rush the stage circle Walt

WALT (VO)
One person thought I was having a
seizure but it was the opposite
I finally felt relaxed

Attempts to get Walt upright are impossible his body
responds with doll-like physics

His unblinking gaze fixed on something in the distance

WALT (VO)

I felt like a feather Mental zero
gravity I couldn’t take my eyes
off this blinking neon sign in the

corner a sign I’d never seen
from that angle It was oddly
soothing

WALT’S HAZY POV A blinking neon sign hanging beside a
corridor that reads

Disappear Here Disappear Here Disappear Here
PARAMEDICS push through the crowd to Walt

WALT (VO)

It wasn’t until they were shining a
light in my eyes that I came
around Suddenly they strapped
me to a gurney

As Walt is carried out it’s evident the neon sign is part of
a much larger advertisement for a line of cruise ships

WALT (VO)

Apparently I kept repeating those
neon words while I was rushed to
the hospital The way a bum begs
for food on the verge of passing
out they told me

CARTER
And and what did they find in your

WALT
Blue ones and yellow ones

CARTER
What effect were you trying to
trigger

WALT

Something new something else

CARTER
But why those Taken at random

WALT
Blue and yellow I thought blue
and yellow can’t be too bad they
make green

Carter glances out the window

CARTER
When does the new season start

WALT
Next week Mondays now apparently

CARTER
Are you

WALT

Carter curiously follows Walt alongside the building where
there are no doors only windows

In the distance their driver drags on a cigarette

WALT
I know we’re pressed on time but
it’s important I do this

Carter nods too confused to speak

Walt climbs up a partial hedge underneath a large window
it’s obvious he’s done this before

CARTER
Walt

Walt suddenly ducks his head out of sight

WALT
(whisper )
Down Get down Quiet

Walt peers in the window again

WALT (CONTD)
This room’ll be buzzing with
activity in a minute

CARTER
What are you looking at and why
aren’t we walking through doors and
using entrances

WALT
This is where Hallie works

CARTER
That only answered about ten
percent of what I was asking

Walt gets frustrated

WALT
If it isn’t obvious Carter
Hallie and I broke up

Walt is saddened to hear himself admit this
Carter looks ill

CARTER
You’re not together

WALT
Haven’t seen her in over two weeks
I needed to get a glimpse

Carter flips through his pages as though he’s missed
something

CARTER
But tonight

Walt gives Carter a knowing look Then he lifts his head up
slowly to the window

Overcome with a sudden sense of camaraderie Carter crouches
down by Walt Refocused anxious

CARTER
What do you see

WALT
Caretakers

CARTER
Mm-hmm

WALT

Everybody’s seated around a table
A staff member is reading to them

CARTER
Mm-hmm

WALT
They’re following along with their
hands

Walt looks down at Carter and his notepad

WALT
Are you writing all this

CARTER
Of course

Carter answers with a tone that implies there’s only one
answer

WALT
Oh

Walt peers inside again

CARTER
Can I see inside

WALT
I‘1l describe her to you

INT OFFICE BUILDING MAIN AREA -- CONTINUOUS

A woman who can only be HALLIE (early 30s) enters She’s
delicate yet firm The patient type that listens intently
even if she already knows the answer

MEN and WOMEN sit around various tables listening to a
SPEAKER at the head of the room The speaker runs through
slides of astronomy planets star formations with braille
equivalent

Hallie walks among them adjusting their hands They’re
learning to read

WALT (0S)
You know they have to relearn
everything You think you know the
layout of your house Close your
eyes and move around

(beat)

In return the blind are blessed
with a deeper intimacy They sense
her energy that much more Their
nerve endings react to her ina
special way

Walt melts as he watches Hallie adjust various hands an
intimacy he yearns for

WALT (0S) (CONT’D)
I helped out here once and they
could tell who was who just by the
way you walk into a room

EXT SIDE OF THE BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS

WALT
Alright

Walt climbs back down One of the wooden ledges splits and
he FALLS to the ground Branches CRACK leaves SHAKE

WALT
Dammit

CARTER
Whoa you okay

Walt clings to the side of the building glances around
all is clear

WALT
That fall was off the record

Walt looks back at the hedge No longer climbable

WALT
I got my glimpse Let’s go

They cross the parking lot to the cab Walt limps the first
few paces shaking off the pain of the fall

CARTER
Let me make sure I have this
properly You planned the proposal
you guys broke up and you’re afraid
to call it off

WALT
Negatory We broke up then I
planed it Recovery is not as
sunny as it sounds I had to have
hope

CARTER
She broke up with you in recovery

WALT
I ended it

CARTER
This gets worse

WALT
I knew she wouldnt do it for that
reason so I pulled the plug

CARTER
But people are counting on this
proposal Why do I feel like I’m
the crazy one here Talk to her
now we have time
Walt stops faces Carter

WALT
I need to be a hero before she
takes me back That much I know

CARTER
Why do you need to be a hero

Walt starts walking again Carter thinks then catches

Walt looks

CARTER (CONTD)
You haven’t even apologized

WALT
My apology is being built ona
sound stage in Burbank Do you
know a bigger more sincere apology
than a proposal It says
everything you could hope to say--

CARTER
Without saying any of it

WALT
--all at once

at him

CARTER
I didn’t mean to say that

WALT

Carter let me tell you something
about your place At your age life
is very much your parent’s doing
when you get to mine the blame
shifts

(beat)
I was this close to cancelling
earlier I didn’t know what the
fuck I was going to do Now
there’s a way for everything to
work out Good coincidences and
addicts are rarely bed buddies
know what I mean

Carter nods opting to keep quiet

WALT (CONT’D)
For an unbiased journo your
opinion seem to rear its ugly head
at odd junctures Just remember
youre a speck all of us are

up

Carter remains mum hastily SCRIBBLING to keep up Walt gets
caught up in the feeling of having his words transcribed

WALT (CONTD)
Tiny dots in the universe
Remember how we connected them in
those little books as kids

slightly by pearl

Nad is busy tweaking a bouquet of flowers while squinting at
his reference photo

An INTERN approaches him carrying a bulging trash bag

INTERN

The intern stops short startled by Nad’s opposite hair-part
Stares a moment

NAD
Yes

INTERN
You wanted me to bring one copy of
every publication denouncing our
show and predicting its demise

NAD
That was quick

INTERN
We’re on a lot of covers

Nad peeks in the bulging bag at the entertainment rags
commenting on his embarrassing ratings One has a picture of
a toilet that isn’t a coincidence

NAD
(lying)
No dammit I said get every copy
of every publication and burn them

INTERN

JAKOB
Nad Nad You’ve become unruly
Put your watch back on please

NAD
I don’t think so

JAKOB
Why take it off
WENDY
And don’t tell us you showered

Nad rotates his wrist

Nad looks

Wendy and Jakob study the new part

NAD
Got a little heavy

WENDY
Put your watch back on If you go
out tonight and you’re not wearing
it

JAKOB
You are not allowed to leave us
Read the contract But we can
sever ties in a second

NAD
That doesn’t sound like a proper
relationship

WENDY
The viewers aren’t going to trust
you if we pull out It’1ll cause a
ripple effect First your viewers
then your friends and family
then more viewers

a little less relaxed

JAKOB
Who validates who here We came
simply to wish you luck
(to Wendy)
Why is he doing this

WENDY
And what is this this deal with
your hair Did you cut it

JAKOB
Will somebody tell me what the hell
is going on

Walt and Carter peruse the electronics aisle

CARTER
We do have cell phones Walt

WALT
This is a walkie-talkie thing
What if we don’t get service The
enormity of what we’re undertaking
demands an exacting
intelligence

Walt is too preoccupied to engage Carter’s question
seriously

CARTER
What if one of the walkie-talkies
break

WALT

Here we go

The walkie-talkies are stashed away at the end Gray
industrial looking radios offering hundreds of frequencies
Walt doesn’t know what any of it means

Then Walt spots a bright blue pair more a child’s toy with a
graphic of two kids playing with their fort a wall between
them The range says 20 feet Walt picks it up and stares

BURNHAM (0S)
A killer endorsement opportunity
I won’t spoil the surprise

WALT
Burnham we’re cutting it too close
here Maybe I should fly solo for
Nad’s show No sponsors

BURNHAM (0S)
Bad idea Too risky to stand on
your own so soon after treatment

Walt closes his eyes visibly detaining his temper

BURNHAM (0S) (CONTD)
I’m giving you choices here Walt
We’1ll have something before

Burnham HANGS up The town car driver’s phone BUZZES with

Burnham’s text message

telling him to screw

WALT
What do you mean “way more than I
could possibly know”

TOBIN
I think they’1l be relieved

NAD
There’s a special reason all this

dots connecting things

TOBIN
Seeing dots is a symptom of a heart
attack

The elevators doors open to a parking garage Nad steps

quickly

Tobin limps after him

NAD
You don’t have to come but I have
been waiting a long time for the

Walt and Carter sit on opposite ends of an open lobby area

It’s a shop-class layout where EMPLOYEES wear socks on their
hands testing the durability of various prototypes on
different simulated surfaces

HANNIGAN (30s) steps into the lobby removes a pair of socks

from his hands lifts his eye goggles and greets Walt

Hannigan leads Walt and Carter through the workshop
evident that Sock’Rates is a company that sells socks

HANNIGAN
Come on back we’re thrilled to
have you

WALT
(formalcold)
Thank you Great to be

It’s

The three of them settle around a metal table away from the

activity

HANNIGAN
I know you have a big night ahead
of you Mr Erkins so I appreciate
this

Walt closes his eyes a moment then opens them and nods his

head

HANNIGAN
(clears throat)
Socrates never wrote anything down--
all we know about him and his
cognitive prowess was passed on to
us by his students Plato being
his most famous pupil

Walt nods absently

Walt brings his hands to his head feigning emotion

HANNIGAN (CONTD)
Our reputation is reliant on others
as well Socrates lived in a time
when wars were openly declared
fought on battlefields where the
outcome was decidedly hard and
true

(beat)

Today wars are ongoing fought at
all times on all terrain Walk
into any retail store and you’1ll
see evidence of it How to
distinguish one product from
another

unimpressed listens to Hannigan with doubt

Carter

Hannigan’s eyes narrow sensing Walt’s apathy but carries

on

HANNIGAN (CONTD)

We’re not deluding ourselves We
understand the need to be
aggressive Plato was instrumental
in shaping our perception of
Socrates will you be our Plato
Walt

Walt drops his head briefly

HANNIGAN (CONTD)
Walt

WALT
Okay Cut the shit Cut all this
shit You wanna make money I
wanna make money Fuck it
Where’s the contract

Hannigan reluctantly slides the contract over to Walt

Carter stands up but sits down again--fighting the urge
speak his mind

Walt picks up the contract weighs it his hand

WALT
Nice and light First indication

Walt removes a pen from his inner suit pocket

WALT (CONTD)

(to Carter)
Lesson one in adult life
compromise The world couldnt go
on if everybody got their own way
society would crumble

(beat)
If plastic were human it would
have to change to stay alive

Walt barely looks at each page as he thumbs through it

WALT (CONT’D)
Looks good Looks good

Hannigan is displeased

HANNIGAN
We sign winners

to

WALT
(winks )
And I’ve never admitted to losing

CARTER
(to Walt)
Just wait a sec will you

HANNIGAN
You give a speech about compromise
while signing our contract

WALT
(ignoring both)
The date is ah that’s right

Walt pens in the date Just as he moves to the signature
line Hannigan SNATCHES the contract away

WALT
Haven’t signed it yet--

HANNIGAN
Whose side are you on

WALT
What did I miss here
(points to Carter)
What’d he say

HANNIGAN
Not him You

WALT
Come again Come on hand the damn
thing over so we can all rejoice in
celebra--

Walt reaches for the contract but Hannigan moves it out of
his reach

HANNIGAN
Not only have you insulted us but
you might want to consider
apologizing to the makers of your
suit I’ve never seen a man shame
so many brands in one sitting

A beat

Walt LEAPS from his chair tackling Hannigan to the floor--
the day’s aggression finally has a proper target They
tumble and trade body blows The sounds of FABRIC RIPPING
heavily outweighs the sounds of FLESH PUMMELING

CARTER
Walt

Carter attempts to break it up but takes a poorly aimed
kidney shot from Hannigan and goes down hard

WALT
Dammit kid Get outta here

Hannigan sends a lethal blow to Walt’s gut while his
attention is on Carter The force of the blow knocks Walt
back on the table with the contract

Everybody groans clutching their respective limbs Walt
especially It’s over because nobody has any fight left

EXT SOCK’RATES OFFICES -- DAY

Walt exits letting the door close on Carter who pushes it
angrily

They don’t speak as they slowly awkwardly descend the stairs
to their cab Wincing in pain at each step they move like
wounded warriors emerging from battle

CARTER
I couldn’t let you do it Fuck
sponsors

Walt holds up his hand for silence but he nods
understanding

CUT TO

EXT OUTSKIRTS OF LOS ANGELES -- DAY

The town car drives through the dry empty deserts of Los
Angeles--not quite out of the city but enough for the
dreamer to feel further away than they actually are

EXT APARTMENT COMPLEX -- DAY

They arrive at the gate of a modest apartment complex Entry
code required

DRIVER
It’s in here Need an entry code

WALT
Isn’t there a rule about rentals
Can’t we go in like cops

The driver shakes his head sympathetically

WALT
I just moved in and forgot--

DRIVER
You don’t have to lie me

Walt is taken aback a little ashamed
WALT
We’ll have to tail behind someone

if that’s okay

CUT TO

EXT APARTMENT COMPLEX -- DAY
Their car IDLES around the corner

A jeep leaves the complex from the “exit” side The town car
ACCELERATES just as the gate is closing

Walt reacts with excitement

WALT
That’s what I’m saying here Yeah

EXT APARTMENT COMPLEX -- CONTINUOUS

Rows of symmetrical apartments gray cracked driveways
shared garages and overgrown weeds on the periphery of the
landscape

The town car winds through streets within the complex that
wholly resemble each other a modern labyrinth--the suburban
equivalent of the vapid corridors from the opening scene

INT TOWN CAR -- CONTINUOUS

They finally arrive at an unremarkable set of stairs The
driver turns around nods at Walt

WALT
Countless people pass by everyday
without the slightest notion of
what’s going on inside

CARTER
What is going on inside

WALT
(beat)
Take off your shoes

Walt breaks open the walkie-talkie package excited

CARTER
What why

WALT
It‘ll be quieter

CARTER
(sighs)
Are you taking yours off

WALT
If you do yours that’1ll cut out
half the noise It’s my thing

Carter sighs again and kicks off his dress shoes

WALT
If anything happens be ready

DRIVER
You got it

WALT
When we get out reconfigure the
car this way

Walt gestures a getaway position for the wrong end of the
street

Carter gets the driver’s attention and motions the opposite
way The driver nods understanding

Walt hands Carter one of the blue walkie-talkies

CARTER
Walt

Walt looks at him Carter nods to the apartment

CARTER (CONTD)
You know you’1ll know right

WALT
(beat in radio)
Copy that

Walt nods satisfied

WALT (CONTD)
Culture is worth a little risk

And with that Walt KICKS the door open and the two of them
tiptoe up the driveway

EXT APARTMENT COMPLEX -- CONTINUOUS

Walt surveys the property attempting to find any discernible
clues an obvious deployment of psuedo-detective skills
learned from television

Walt points to a mostly-crushed soda can on the stairs but
says nothing

They arrive at the door Walt looks at Carter back at the
town car then KNOCKS and steps out of sight

Moments later BARRY (20s) answers the door sipping a
homemade fruit smoothie Barry has lose-fitting jeans and
the type of faded T-shirt one usually wears to paint

At first Barry doesn’t see anybody then he notices Walt and
Carter on either side of the door

BARRY
God
(beat)
You’re Walt Erkins

Walt is frozen in shock looks at Carter

BARRY
(glances around)
If this is one of those things
where you come to the door with a
camera and stuff I’m not
interested

Walt looks past Barry into the house

BARRY (CONTD)
This isn’t is it

Walt looks at Carter confused tongue-tied Carter opens to
a fresh page in his notepad

CARTER
We’re investigating something The
IP address to a A Lesbian Life In
Yemen led us here You know
anything about that

Barry turns white SUCKS THE STRAW of his now empty fruit
smoothie

CUT TO

INT BARRY’S APARTMENT -- MINUTES LATER
The walls are covered with hundreds of photographs depicting
a panoramic view of Yemen’s landscape desert and sky The
mural from left to right fades from morning into night
Elegant graffiti on the opposite wall in big letters

LIVE FUCK APOLOGIZE

Carter sits on a faded sofa Barry is in the kitchen cutting
up fruit for a new smoothie

Walt paces in between All three adrenalized
BARRY

If you’re hoping for an apology or
something then get out

WALT

Or maybe you’re some sick stalker
BARRY

Please--
WALT

How could you just make up a
person An Arabic lesbian And
make everyone else look like such
idiots

BARRY
It’s not about you that’s the
whole point

WALT
I cared about that girl Ahdia

Barry freezes up takes offense
BARRY
As if I don’t Why do you think we
started that blog

CARTER
We

WALT
Sick amusement

BARRY
That says more about you than it
does me

WALT

What I am left with You pull the
curtain back on this touching
story you seem like some

asshole

BARRY
I pulled nothing back You showed
up here

WALT

You let her get kidnapped Like
were all supposed to sit here

BARRY
(faintly touched)
You came out here because you
thought she was kidnapped

Walt HITS his fist in the palm of his hand angry
The phone RINGS

BARRY
Please I need to get that

WALT
Leave it You’re not telling
anyone I’m here

Walt confronts him in the kitchen

WALT (CONTD)
When you replace someone else’s
voice with your own you suck the
life out of it You think I’m
interested in Ahdia’s life “as
told by you” you fuck You fooled
us but most of all you’re fooling
yourself sitting there

(looks at his workspace)
-behind dusty shoddy blinds
amidst old take-out containers
probably a month--

Barry splits an apple with way more force than necessary

BARRY
Go shove off somewhere you fu--The
most I’1ll ever be able to achieve
is shit most people can piss on and
that infuriates me

Barry loads the blender with cut fruit

BARRY (CONTD)
But I’m a good soul and I’m
finding my way

WALT
Sure are

Barry RUNS THE BLENDER forgetting to put the lid on--it
SPLATTERS EVERYWHERE Barry’s face the walls and cabinets
and Walt’s suit covered in a gloppy red fruit

Faces aghast The phone RINGS AGAIN but no one reacts

Barry starts hyperventilating looks at the mess not knowing
where to begin

Walt is in temporary a state of shock

BARRY
I have to sit down

Barry clearly shaken takes a seat by his computer
Walt stays in the kitchen cleans himself with a rag

CARTER
(beat)
I know what that’s like Barry I
wannna be a French journalist some
day

WALT
This is great

CARTER

(ignores Walt to Barry)
The past two days I’ve had to
follow this guy around and in doing
so come to terms with the fact
that it will probably never happen
for me And instead I’m doing an
article for an over the hill game
show host

WALT
Over the hill my ass
(points at Barry)
He recognized me Him

BARRY
You could care less about me

WALT
And look at the billboards if you
want proof
(accusingly)
You said it was a comeback profile

CARTER
And I said I added ‘comeback’ for
dramatic flair

Walt knows he’s right

CARTER (CONTD)
Or were too busy sulking over how a
meager company is willing to pay
you slightly less for an
endorsement You wanna talk about
not making sense God-almighty
I’ve wondered what your face would
look like if I ever had the balls
to say that

WALT
I’m having your shitty job A good
journalist remains unbiased I’ve
told you that

CARTER
Mister integrity

WALT
A French reporter You didn’t even
wanna take your shoes off

Barry looks at Carter’s socks hadn’t noticed before

CARTER

Well news to you again I don’t
really have a job

(beat)
I’m a tech intern for the magazine
They sent me ‘cuz I have
journalistic aspirations but I’ma
tech intern Guess everyone on the
payroll was too busy for the great
Walt

WALT
(beat)
Oh sure They send an intern and a
car Lies

Carter bites his lip knows he shouldn’t say
CARTER
Burnham your agent took care of

the car

Walt’s legs get wobbly feels light-headed Barry tries to
keep up

WALT
(beat)
What a fucking nightmare all this
is
BARRY
(beat)

If you want to get people to look
at themselves you have to trick
them into thinking they’re looking
at something totally different
first

(beat)
A lesbian girl in some part of the
world youve barely heard of It’s
as disarming as it is poetic This
isn’t a scam it’s a wake up call

Walt stares at Yemen’s landscape on the wall Barry starts
to get angry defensive

BARRY
Who’s to say she’s fake There
could be a girl over there whos
story resembles Ahdia’s exactly
There’s a lot going on--

WALT
Then shame on you for making her
up If there are so many girls
over there why do they need some
overweight white fuck to talk in
their place

Barry sits on the couch stunned

Walt heads to the front door He runs his arm along the
mural TEARING Yemen’s landscape as he goes

BARRY
(stands)
Don’ t--

WALT
Don’t ever tell anyone about this
I never came here

CARTER

(to Walt)

Oh and by the way all our driving
around the city today and I only
saw one billboard of you Uno

WALT
Because you’re blind

Walt SLAMS the door on his way out

EXT BARRY’S APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS

A PLANE SOARS overhead as Walt descends the stairs

He picks a potted plant and HEAVES it against the shared
garage with a loud THUD It falls to the ground fully

intact and rolls a U on the driveway--the garage unaffected

Walt gets in the town car

INT TOWN CAR -- CONTINUOUS

Walt scratches his knuckles blood trickles out The driver
notices his fruit-stained suit

DRIVER
Okay

WALT
(loud)
Huh

More of a deflection than an actual answer

Walt’s CELL rings He reaches for it anxiously relieved at
being freed of the awkward moment--

INTERCUT WITH

INT AGENCY BURNHAM’S OFFICE -- DAY

Burnham stands at his window overlooking LA’s skyline The
framed “spine” poster from earlier is noticeably absent a
dusty squared outline remains

BURNHAM INTO PHONE
How’d it go with Sockrates I
hear those guys are hardcore

Walt massages his temples with his thumb and index finger

WALT
It’s under consideration

BURNHAM
Well forget it Oddly enough you
were right my friend If
Courtland Skies reached out all
those other brands would fall to
the wayside

WALT
What

BURNHAM
CS wants to talk to you I can’t
guarantee anything but they’re not
calling you back in to fire you a
second time that’s for sure

WALT
There’s no way I made a scene
earlier Dilliard Stanton was
meeting with all these people--

BURNHAM
That was the board They couldn’t
believe how great you looked
Healthy etc Apparently you went
on about people as communicators or
something--told you treatment was a
good idea

WALT
They said all that

BURNHAM
I’m sure they’re overpowering
Stanton on this but who cares So
forget who you saw today looks
like you’1l get the chance to soar
again Wally

Walt is in disbelief Looks down at his red-soaked suit
BURNHAM
I know you’re on your way to Nad’s
studio but you need to swing by
Courtland first

WALT
Wow

BURNHAM
If you look as healthy as they say
I think this is going to be a hell
of a year

Walt sighs at Burnham’s veiled attempts at preserving his
client’s ego

Carter emerge from the house Walt sees him approaching

BURNHAM
Everything else good

WALT
As it should be apparently

BURNHAM
Okay see you in Courtland’s sky

Burnham HANGS up just as Carter gets inside Tension is high
as they both do their best not to look at each other

Walt finally notices his bloody knuckle

WALT
God da--

Walt raises a fist but doesn’t slam anything

WALT (CONT’D)
Driver hand me a handkerchief

The driver looks around pats his own jacket
The driver POPS the glove compartment a single auto manual

DRIVER
Uh

WALT
Pass it

Walt takes the manual opens to the middle and “books” his
bloody knuckle Stares out the window

Moments later a taxi passes by with a MAN Walt recognizes

The man does not see him

WALT
Randy

The taxi continues up the street stops once then drives

around a corner

STATIC on the walkie-talkies startles Walt TWO KIDS are

playing nearby using the same channel

Angry Walt gets out of the car and THROWS his radio

From his new vantage point he sees a car SPEED through same

“exit” side he used to enter the complex

Followed by another car cars too nice to belong here

Walt’s mind races as he gets back in his town car

CARTER
What is it

Suddenly he leaps out back up to Barry’s place

CARTER (CONTD)
What now Dammit

Carter runs after him

INT BARRY’S APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS

Walt enters the door unlocked Barry is on the couch
his head up

BARRY
Oh no No no--

WALT
Wait a second This is serious-—-

BARRY
I want you out

Carter appears behind Walt

WALT
I’m trying to tip you off

BARRY
Go screw

lifts

CARTER
Walt what are you doing

WALT
(to Barry)
Look out your balcony

Barry hesitates then walks over to the back window Walt
follows him

BARRY
What

THROUGH THE BACK WINDOW

Cars are lined up around the corner from the gated entry in
the same way Walt’s car was earlier

The idling cars wait for an opportunity then SPEED through
the “exit” side

Barry turns white

WALT
Unless you’re ready for more house
guests you’d better think of
something

BARRY
(beat)
I don’t care about them I don’t
care I just want you out of here

WALT
Fine But here

Walt reaches in his suit and removes the INTERNATIONAL
ENVELOPE

BARRY
What the hell is this

WALT
A letter I was supposed to mail to
Ahdia

Barry takes it Walt starts to leave when a KNOCK on the
door startles them

They all trade looks Carter the closest to the door peers
through a crack in the blinds

CARTER
It’s that author lady

BARRY
Shit Let her in

Barry rushes to the door

WALT
Who

Dally Nad’s wife storms inside

DALLY
(to Barry)
What the hell is wrong with you I
kept calling

Barry turns red stays silent

It takes Dally a moment to register Walt and Carter then
the red gloppy fruit stains everywhere

DALLY
This place looks nevermind In
a moment

Dally takes a deep breath refocusing her anger She marches
up to Barry

DALLY (CONT’D)
A kidnapping Barry Have you
completely lost it

BARRY
I didn’t agree with where you were
taking her

DALLY
You were sloppy You used “miles”
in one of her posts earlier She
doesn’t even sound Arabic anymore

Barry looks down at the floor

DALLY (CONT’D)
I nearly choked when I read that
Ahdia can’t die--

BARRY
She won’t We can use that she’1ll
get freed

DALLY
Will she now I’m firing you--

BARRY
I got tired of okaying each post
with your publisher This is
bigger than that much bigger Did
you read the paper today Another
car bomb went off in Yemen--

Carter peers out the front window

CARTER
Uh This has to be seen to be
believed

This gets everybody’s attention They all turn to Carter
THROUGH THE FRONT WINDOW

Cars are parked every which way PEOPLE stand around anxious
confused Some point up the stairs

A few stand out in their gray suits and black ties TV hosts
like Randy whom Walt recognized There are no TV camera’s
however these are mostly regular folks private people on a
secret mission

Dally is still peering through the blinds

DALLY
It’s all falling apart for the
wrong reasons You tipped it too
far
(beat)
You’re telling me all these people
are here for Ahdia Hm

Dally turns around notices Walt and Barry chatting quietly
in the corner

Carter is once again taking notes

DALLY
What are you discussing And who
are you two

CARTER
(matter-of-factly)
Carter Sinclair would-be
journalist Renowned game show
host Walt Erkins

Carter flips to a new page

CARTER (CONTD)
Let me ask you what did you hope
to accomplish by--

Dally ignores Carter walks over to Walt and Barry

DALLY
So much for putting the spotlight
on Yemen You’ve got a bunch of
concerned lunatics on your
driveway

BARRY
They’re not lunatics

DALLY
Let’s think about this a minute

Walt moves to the front door
WALT
Forget it Ahdia did die to me

at least But I can try to save
her for them

DALLY
Don’t you move
EXT BARRY’S APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS

Walt steps outside GASPS are heard as he walks to the top
the stairs

The chatter subsides Walt looks down at the crowd
searching for the right words They look up at him with
wide eager eyes

WALT
I know why you’re all here I
was here for her too But--

CITIZEN
What’s it like in there

CITIZEN 2
How is she

Walt hesitates decides to go for it

WALT
Alive

More GASPS

of

CITIZEN 2

I knew it We’re not too late
WALT

But she lives on elsewhere

(beat)
That IP address that you followed
here is a proxy A front a
false lead to protect her true
whereabouts

MURMURS from the crowd Walt scans the crowd for Randy he
finds him on the outer edge biting his nails He’s a red-
faced balding man with a suit one size too small

WALT
Randy how why are you here

Randy shrugs embarrassed

RANDY
I don’t know same as you

INT NAD’S TOWN CAR -- CONTINUOUS

Nad and Tobin sit idling in a town car watching this take
place Nad is eating an apple

TOBIN
Isn’t that Randy or what’s his
name Isn’t he taping that God-
awful show today Who are the rest
of them

EXT BARRY’S APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS

Nad exits the car and tosses the apple aside

Tobin grips his watch defensively as he watches Nad approach
the crowd

NAD
Why do you have blood on you Walt
And your suit’s all torn

All heads turn at the sound of Nad’s voice
WALT

Nad This it’s a fruit
smoothie
NAD
Your hand Look at his hand

People suddenly notice Walt’s bloody knuckles

WALT
I scratch my--it’s raw skin

NAD
Don’t bullshit me Walt You’re
hoarding whatever’s up there

CITIZEN 3
What’s really going on

WALT
It’s some old lady scared out of
her mind from all this commotion
Let her be

NAD
We have a right to know what’s
going on inside

WALT
I just told you

CITIZEN
He wants to take all the credit

WALT
There’s no credit to be had

Walt looks back at the door distressed

Nad pushes through the crowd

stairs

CITIZEN 2
Let us in

NAD
Come on We’ll push down the door
if we have to

People start crowding the

INT BARRY’S APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS

Dally looks at Carter and Barry They grow anxious at the

SHOUTS of the unruly crowd

EXT BARRY’S APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS
Dally emerges the crowd gets quiet again

At the sight of her Nad suddenly looks vulnerable Then he
looks at Walt then Dally

Walt realizes what Nad’s connecting

WALT
No no It’s not--

Nad suddenly charges up the stairs to Walt They WRESTLE
briefly The rest of the crowd looks on horrified

NAD
(to Walt
My wife you asshole

DALLY
Nad This isn’t it at all

NAD
I was going to have both of you on
my show tonight How much of a

fool do you take me for

WALT
It’s not about you

Dally attempts to break it up

DALLY
Nad enough

NAD
Don’t stick up for him I was
going to propose to you again

The DOOR OPENS once more

Nad has Walt pinned down but freezes as he looks up to see
Barry step out Dally is still staring at Nad

Nad looks down at Walt gets off him but doesn’t help him up
NAD
Who are you And where’s Ahdia

We’re going inside

BARRY
If that’s what you want

Nad looks around at everyone behind him feeling like the
unofficial leader

NAD
It is what we want

INT BARRY’S APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS
Carter is SCRIBBLING in his notepad to keep up

BARRY (0S)
I want you all to know something
first beware that once you walk
through this door you will have
your answer

EXT BARRY’S APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS
BARRY
You may like it you may regret
it but you’1l know
As this sinks in some are saddened some nod understanding
the way children react when they piece together the truth
about ol’ Saint Nick and wander what the next Christmas will

feel like

People trade looks WHISPERS are passed Two people in the
back turn around and leave

A long beat A few more walk away The crowd is thinning
though some remain

Nad watches them walk away gets frustrated

NAD
It’d be unwise to stop us now

Nad PUSHES the door open--

INT BARRY’S APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS

Nad walks to the center of the living room Starts breathing
heavily as he scans the room

A few more people walk in after him
Nad looks at the computer the fruit stains on the couch

suddenly humiliated He starts HYPERVENTILATING clutches
his left arm he goes down

NADS HAZY POV

The “LIVE FUCK APOLOGIZE banner on the wall in and out
of focus The torn Yemen landscape on the opposite wall

People rush over to him his body responds with rag-doll
physics

FADE TO WHITE

FADE IN

INT BARRY’S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

Barry is alone in his apartment He sits down on the stained
couch removes Walt’s letter to Ahdia Cuts it open

WALT (VO)
Dear Ahdia

CUT TO

INT AMBULANCE -- NIGHT

Nad is in the back of a SPEEDING ambulance an oxygen mask on
his face He looks up at Dally who is sitting next to him

WALT (VO)
I’m not sure if this will ever get
to you but that might be why it’s
easier for me to write I am
writing from America and have been
an avid reader of your online
journal

DALLY
Pills again Nad

NAD
If I make it I’ll be a hero
right

Dally has a stern look on her face but she RE-PARTS Nad’s
hair tenderly to the opposite side

Nad reaches up to her face removes her sunglasses

WALT (VO)
I don’t quite understand all the
problems that plague your country
(MORE )

WALT (VO) (CONTD)
a lot of the political corruption
is over my head but I have no
doubt conditions are tough for you
And your sexuality can only serve
to complicate things

CUT TO

INT TOWN CAR (CITY STREETS) -- NIGHT

Walt and Carter sit in back They stare out the window a
silent ride

WALT (VO)

They say everybody needs a sponsor
Someone that validates them in a
way they can’t do for themselves
Your post about the harsh realities
of buying bread made me sick the
way people can treat one another

I have a certain skepticism toward
others that I sense in you too

Walt checks his phone sees Burnham calling IGNORES it

CUT TO

EXT VISUAL IMPAIRMENT CENTER -- NIGHT
Walt’s car pulls up Walt and Carter stare at the entrance
WALT

If this works out I’11 send you
to France

Carter is speechless Walt gets out of the car Starts
walking up to the doors but stops and turns around

Carter lowers the window Walt turns to say something but
stops himself and continues on

CARTER
Walt Wait what is it

WALT
I was gonna say I’1ll go too but
no That’s your country

CARTER
It might be yours too

Walt gets serious as he realizes what lies ahead of him

WALT (VO)
I really enjoy reading the posts
about you and Nazirah It makes me
laugh I guess couples argue the
same way on one side of the world
as they do on the other

Walt hesitates then opens the doors to reveal

STARS PLANETS OUR GALAXY being projected on an enormous
screen All heads in the room turn Hallie among them

WALT (VO)
That’s why I’ve been feeling this
skepticism toward people fading
away If I can’t get along with
them here where can I go In the
mean time I look forward to your
next post Sincerely Walt Erkins

The doors close behind Walt we tilt toward THE SKY

WALT (VO)

PS Oh I found out the Romans
used to call your homeland Arabia
Felix means “Happy Arabia” But
I’ve been thinking that from a
distance everything must look
better That mirage-effect that’s
fooled us for centuries But no
matter where we go we’re all under
the same sky

(beat)
So look up from time to time
and I will too

the sky rapidly gets brighter whiter as we--
