EXT SPACE

CAMERA SPEEDS through the heavens past the moon through
the Universe traveling on gathering speed further and
further through the limitless void until it bursts
through into another Galaxy

EXT SPACE NEAR KRYPTON

A miniscule RED DOT appears growing larger spreading
evenly into a BLAZING SUN which fills the SCREEN The
fiery red SUN now grows smaller as we fall through space
and see beyond it - the planet Krypton As CAMERA

and Kryptons two distinct hemispheres CAMERA HOLDS
PEERS DOWN at the city of Kryptonopolis
EXT KRYPTONOPOLIS - DAY

CAMERA PANS the white prismatic crystalline mountains
near the city WE SEE a gleaming quicksilver lake

EXT CITY OF KRYPTONOPOLIS - DAY

Kryptonopolis is a magical city constructed of pure
white crystalline matter that encloses and protects it
from the blazing red sun CAMERA TRACKS across
futuristic glass buildings glass skyways tunnels and
enclosed gardens finally CLOSING IN on a specific
domed structure silhouetted against the sky A MANS
VOICE is heard gathering in volume and intensity

JOR-ELS VOICE (VO)
This is no fantasy No careless product
of a wild imagination We are not
dealing here with idle supposition

CAMERA CLOSES IN on the domed roof of the building now
DISSOLVES THROUGH

INT TRIAL CHAMBER - DAY

An electric white aura fills the screen The dim outline
of JOR-ELS head can be seen almost floating above it
facing away from CAMERA as he continues

JOR-EL
no gentlemen The indictment I have
brought you this day the specific
charges listed therein against these
individuals their acts of treason and
ultimate aim of sedition
(swivels to FACE
CAMERA )
These are matters of undeniable fact

The face of JOR-EL fills the SCREEN as he points an
accusing finger INTO CAMERA A handsome intelligent
face with great intensity bathed in the electric white
aura which surrounds him almost pulsating with energy

WIDE ANGLE - TRIAL CHAMBER

JOR-EL stands on the dark edge of a circular white ring
of light thrusting down from the ceiling of the chamber

The domed roof rises cathedral-like above imprinted
with giant projections of the faces of the COUNCIL OF
ELDERS (eleven besides JOR-EL) who watch the
proceedings in judgment presumably from some other
location Each ELDER is bathed in a specific aura
similar to that of JOR-EL Trapped inside the central
dazzling white ring of light are THREE FIGURES JOR-EL
circles the edge of the ring

JOR-EL
I ask you now to pronounce your judgment
on those accused

CLOSE ON NON

The monstrous face of NON peers through the light at
JOR-EL A man only to the extent that he is not an
animal - a force of frightening destruction whose only
sounds are terrifying guttural roars

JOR-ELS VOICE
On this mindless aberration whose only
means of expression are wanton violence
and destruction

NON lunges at JOR-EL with a roar bounces back off the
edge of the ring of light which imprisons him

CAMERA PANS TO URSA A tall woman with a strikingly
beautiful and cruel face Consumed by a total hatred
Consumed by a total hatred of the male sex she stares
back at JOR-EL with patronizing contempt

JOR-ELS VOICE
On the woman URSA whose perversions
and unreasoning hatred of men have
finally threatened even the male
children on our planet

CAMERA PANS TO GENERAL ZOD Glaring defiantly at JOR-EL
through the dazzling light with a staggeringly vicious
face Even trapped in the prison of light he seems to
generate an evil force of his own
REVISION 21377

JOR-ELS VOICE
And finally on General Zod - Once
trusted by this Council charged with
maintaining the defenses of the planet
Krypton itself - the chief architect of
this intended revolution the author of
this insidious plot to establish a new
order among us - with himself as
absolute ruler

WIDE ANGLE - TRIAL CHAMBER

The huge faces of the COUNCIL OF ELDERS peer down from
the domed ceiling as JOR-EL finishes

JOR-EL
You have listened to the evidence The
decision of the Council will now be
heard

Silence CAMERA PANS UP to the faces The FIRST ELDER
pauses momentarily

FIRST ELDER
Guilty

The FIRST ELDERS face instantly disappears from the
domed ceiling

SECOND ELDER
Guilty

The SECOND ELDERS face disappears One by one the
remaining NINE ELDERS vote guilty in rapid succession
until the ceiling has become a black void

CLOSE ON JOR-EL AND VILLAINS

JOR-EL faces GENERAL ZOD his aura glowing as a separate
island of light outside the circle

JOR-EL
Do you have anything to say before the
decision of the Council is pronounced

ZOD

(cold stare)
The vote must be unanimous Jor-El It
has therefore now become your decision
You alone will condemn us if you wish
And you alone will be held responsible
by me

(JOR-EL stares

blankly)
Join us You have been known to disagree
with the Council before Yours could
become an important voice in the New
Order - second only to my own I offer
you a chance for greatness Jor-El Take
it Join us

JOR-EL hesitates briefly then suddenly disappears — his
electric white aura extinguishing itself ZODs face
twists with rage

ZOD
One day you will bow down before me
Jor-El

EXT TRIAL CHAMBER IN SPACE —- DAY

The domed roof of the building cracks open starts to
swivel back In the distance a slate-gray atmospheric
eminence (THE PHANTOM ZONE) travels rapidly through the
sky approaches the opening

INT TRIAL CHAMBER
The VILLAINS are alone in the trial chamber ZOD rants

ZOD
I swear it No matter that it takes an
eternity You will bow down before me

The gray mass of the Phantom Zone has entered through
the open dome closes down on the VILLAINS erasing the
ring of white light as it progresses

ZOD
» Both you and then one day your
heirs

INT COUNCIL - DAY

A pristinely immaculate chamber that overlooks the city
of Kryptonopolis Austere dominated by concentric
circles around which the TWELVE ELDERS sit or stand In
the center of the inner circle revolved an intelligence
source on which various information may be presented
JOR-EL enters the chamber appearing almost through
motivational volition than through physical propulsion
The ELDERS turn look at him JOR-EL is deeply
concerned

FIRST ELDER
An unpleasant duty has been masterfully
performed Jor-El They have received
the fate they deserved - isolation in
the Phantom Zone - an eternal living
death

JOR-EL
A chance for life nonetheless As
opposed to us

Consternation from the ELDERS A suddenly angry JOR-EL
gestures at the revolving intelligence source in the
center - various unfathomable equations appear

JOR-EL
You cant ignore these facts Its
suicide Worse Genocide

FIRST ELDER
Jor-El be warned The Council has
already evaluated this outlandish
theory of yours

JOR-EL
My friends you know me to be neither
rash nor impulsive I am not given to
wild unsupported statements I tell you
we must evacuate this planet
immediately

FIRST ELDER
You are one of Kryptons greatest
scientists Jor-El

SECOND ELDER
But so is Vond-Ah

VOND-AH
(rising)
Thank you
(to JOR-EL)
It isnt that I question your data The
facts are undeniable

VOND-AH gestures at the intelligence source JOR-ELS

equations disappear are immediately replaced by a new
series VOND-AH smiles thinly

VOND-AH
Its your conclusions I find
unsupportable

JOR-EL

This planet will explode within thirty
days Sooner perhaps

VOND-AH
I tell you Krypton is simply shifting
its orbit

SECOND ELDER
Jor-El be reasonable

JOR-EL
I have never been otherwise The madness
is yours
REVISION 21377

FIRST ELDER

(snaps firmly)
This discussion is terminated The
decision of the council is final

(pause - to JOR-EL)
Any attempt by you to create a climate
of fear and panic among the populace
must be deemed by us an act of
insurrection

JOR-EL
You would accuse me of insurrection Has
it now become a crime to cherish life

FIRST ELDER
(with reluctance)
You would be banished to endless
imprisonment in the Phantom Zone - the
eternal void which you yourself
discovered

Deadly silence The FIRST ELDER locks eyes with JOR-EL

FIRST ELDER
Will you abide by the Councils
decision

JOR-EL
(long pause)
I will remain silent Neither my wife
nor I will attempt to leave Krypton

stops watches JOR-EL who senses her presence turns

LARA
Have you finished

JOR-EL
Very nearly

LARA turns away shuts her eyes JOR-EL crosses to her

JOR-EL
Its the only answer Lara If he remains
here he as will die as surely as
(she looks)
we will

LARA
(pleading)
But why earth Jor-El Theyre
primitives Thousands of years behind
us

JOR-EL
He will need that advantage to survive
Their atmosphere will sustain him

LARA
He will defy their gravity

JOR-EL
He will look like one of them

LARA
But he wont be one of them

JOR-EL
His dense molecular structure will make
him strong

JOR-EL
Fast Virtually invulnerable

LARA
Isolated Alone

JOR-EL looks at her with compassion but with the
strength to cut her off

JOR-EL
He will not be alone He will never
be alone

INT COUNCIL OF ELDERS - NIGHT

The COUNCIL OF ELDERS still in session listen
attentively to a MILITARY OFFICER standing before them

MILITARY OFFICER
The energy input to Jor-Els quarters is
now in excess Our Data indicates the
loss is due to a mis-use of energy

The FIRST ELDER exchanges a worried glance at the SECOND
ELDER then looks back at the OFFICER

FIRST ELDER
Investigate

SECOND ELDER
And if the Data proves correct

FIRST ELDER
(pause)
He knew the penalty he faced Even as a
member of this Council The law will be
upheld

JOR-EL

(sad whisper)
You will travel far my little Kal-El
But I will never leave you Even in the
face of my death the richness of my life
shall be yours All that I have learned
everything I feel all of this and more
I have bequeathed to you my son You
shall carry me inside you all your days
You will make my strength your own see
my life through your eyes as your life
will be seen through mine The son
becomes the father the father becomes
the son This is all that I can send
with you Kal-El And not near so rich a
gift as that your mother sends along
Her love

earth The module glows brightly lit by something from
within CLARK stares hard at it - his eyes changing in
color and consistency

ANGLE ON GEODE - CLARKS X-RAY POV

Seen through CLARKS X-RAY vision which cuts through the
solid surface of the module a green crystal throbs
inside resting on the red yellow and blue blankets

pulsating light

INT KENT KITCHEN

MARTHA stands over the kitchen stove in the early
morning bacon sizzling in the pan a pot of hot coffee
steaming nearby She turns her head slightly calls out

MARTHA

She stops has noticed something out the kitchen window
CAMERA PANS pushes in through window In the distant
wheatfield across the road stands the motionless figure
of CLARK

EXT WHEATFIELD —- DAY

CLARK stands quietly immobile staring north as the

late morning sun hits the side of his face The look is
trance-like as if some force were pulling at him There
is a rustle in the wheat behind him He does not turn

CLARK
I have to leave

MARTHA enters frame stops looks at him thoughtfully
full of emotion

MARTHA
I knew this time would come I knew
it from the day I found you

CLARK turns now faces her He speaks flatly trying to
avoid breaking down

CLARK
Ill bring in the crop before I leave
I talked to Ben Hubbard yesterday

Hell be happy to help out from now on

MARTHA
Hes a good man Ben is Your father
always said so

CLARK
(emotionally)
Mother

MARTHA
(helpless smile)
I know son I know

EXT WHEATFIELD —- DAY

The sun starts to set in the distance CLARK approaches
the vast wheatfield his fathers scythe in his hand He
hesitates a moment unobtrusively looks around then
bursts toward the wheat at SUPER SPEED cutting an
instant four-foot wide swath across the field

INT KITCHEN - DAY - ANGLE ON WHEATFIELD

CAMERA looks through the kitchen window as the
wheatfield practically disintegrates in neat rows before
us then PULLS BACK MARTHA watches her eyes filled
with tears

EXT KENT FARM - DAY

The wind is blowing Tall neat stacks of baled wheat
rise up near the barn CAMERA PANS CLARK stands at the
gate to the road in a windbreaker and slacks has a
rucksack at his side MARTHA holds out a brown paper
bag

MARTHA
I made you
(fighting back tears)
-some sandwiches

CLARK smiles silently closes his hand around the bag
He turns opens the rucksack to place the bag inside

INSERT SHOT - RUCKSACK

The rucksack interior glows with a green light tucked
inside the red yellow and blue blankets is the same
one seen earlier in the barn CLARK closes it

BACK TO SCENE

They face each other for the final time all emotion
both at a sudden loss for words

MARTHA
Do you know where youre headed

CLARK
North

MARTHAS eyes glaze over She manages a brave smile

MARTHA
Remember us Always remember us

Unable to restrain themselves any longer they reach
out collapse into a tight hug

EXT ALASKA HIGHWAY - DAY

CLARK in his light windbreaker his rucksack on his
back walks by the side of the road The wind howls
ruffling his hair but he doesnt seem to mind the cold
CAMERA PANS from a distance a truck appears It pulls
up next to him stops The DRIVER opens the door

TRUCK DRIVER
Get in kid Quick before you freeze to
death

CLARK
(nice smile)
Im okay thanks It was nice of you to
stop though

The DRIVER stares amazed CLARK really means it

DRIVER
What the hell You wanna make a Popsicle
outa yourself none of my business

THE DRIVER slams the door The truck roars off CLARK
watches it leave then turns walks off the side of the
road cross-country heading north

EXT ALASKA - DAY

CAMERA PANS a vast snow-covered plain and an arctic lake
with icebergs floating in it in the distance A polar
bear trudges through the snow stops looks at something
which has attracted his attention CAMERA CONTINUES PAN
the tiny dark figure of CLARK contrasts sharply with
the dazzling white landscape as he makes his way still
north dressed only in his light windbreaker

EXT NEAR NORTH POLE - DAY

A flat desolate plain off to one side is a huge out-
cropping of rock jutting out of the barren snow-covered
landscape A blizzard rages CAMERA PANS to reveal
CLARK the rucksack on the ground beside him The wind
rips across the plain CLARK looks around seems to be
in the process of selecting a specific area He marks
its perimeters with heat vision burning deep lines into
the snow and ice Once the boundaries are drawn CLARK
concentrates on the area within The entire mass of snow
begins to melt away as huge flames shoot around the
gigantic excavation

DISSOLVE TO
EXT SAME AREA - LATER

An enormous crater has been carved out of the rock and
ice CLARK stands in the center reaches into his
rucksack places the green stone on the ground Climbing
back quickly to the edge he focuses into the crater As
his heat vision hits the stone a crystalline foundation
begins to solidify and expand Green radiation glows all
around the excavation site - a wall is formed

Another burst of energy intensifies and constructs a
second side joined at a right angle In the bright cone
of green light multi-colored molecules explode and
expand into a third impregnable wall Through the blaze
of sparkling light this wall increases in size spreads
out to cover the fourth remaining side

CLOSE ON CLARK

CLARK steps back to look with awe The Fortress of
Solitude is complete It rises up in the northern
landscape its materials completely harmonious the
white opaque crystalline blending ingeniously into the
surrounding countryside

INT FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE - DAY

The tiny figure of CLARK enters the Fortress looks up
at a multi-leveled white fantasy Stabbing spurs of
crystal cut across the levels at a severe angle The
decor is spartan minimal The central area with its
complicated memory crystal energy banks where SUPERMAN
will communicate with his dead father is overlooked by a
series of different levels which lead off to hidden
corridors rooms etc The entire dazzling interior is
strongly reminiscent of what we have seen earlier on
Krypton

CLOSE ON ENERGY BANK SECTION

A crystal bench sits next to the energy bank which is
lined with rows of smaller glowing crystals CLARK
approaches mesmerized knowing what he must do but
unsure of how and why He reaches out for the first
crystal places it inside a mechanism in the energy
bank takes his seat on the bench waits suddenly

WIDE ANGLE

The light in the Fortress changes dramatically The
walls and jagged planes of the structure seem to come
alive with energy The wall directly opposite vibrates
with a special intensity A giant face appears It is
JOR-EL His head rises massively up and across the wall
burning with light looking down dwarfing the tiny
figure of CLARK on the bench JOR-ELS eyes flash focus
on him JOR-EL speaks
25377

JOR-EL
My son you do not remember me I am
Jor-El I am your father By now you

will have reached your eighteenth year
of time as it is measured on earth By
that same reckoning I will have been
dead for many thousands of your years
The knowledge that I have of matters
physical and historic I have given to
you fully on your voyage to your new
home These are important matters to be
sure but still matters of mere fact
There are questions to be asked and it
is time for you to do so Here in this
Fortress of Solitude we shall try to
find the answers together How does a
good man live What is virtue When does
a mans obligation to those around him
exceed his obligation to himself These
are not simple questions - even on
Krypton there is no precise science
which provides us with the answers I
can only tell you what I myself believe
To this end I have tried to anticipate
your questions and in the order of
their importance to you

(pause)
Speak
CLARK
Who am I
JOR-EL

Your name is Kal-El You are the only
survivor of the planet Krypton Even
though you have been raised as a human
being you are not one of them You have
great powers only some of which you
have as yet discovered

CAMERA BEGINS A SLOW 360-DEGREE PAN The face and
features of JOR-EL will appear and fade away in many
dimensions and on virtually every area of the fortress
in an intricate and continuous SERIES OF DISSOLVES

JOR-EL
Your mother Lara has sent along three
blankets of red yellow and blue
United in a single garment their
last sentence missing from script

At times there will be simultaneous representations
JOR-EL some merely features of the face in huge
magnifications - eyes mouth profile etc The
DISSOLVES will indicate the passage of a long period of
time Never until the final culmination of the 360 PAN
do we see or hear anything but the face and thought of
JOR-EL

CAMERA BEGINS FIRST SERIES OF DISSOLVES

JOR-EL
You are superior to others You can only
become inferior by setting yourself
above them Lead by inspiration Let
your actions and ideals become a
touchstone against which mankind may
learn how to serve the common good
While it is forbidden for you to
interfere with human history itself
your leadership can stir others to their
own capacity for moral betterment

CAMERA BEGINS SECOND SERIES OF DISSOLVES

JOR-EL
The virtuous spirit has no need for
thanks or approval Only the certain
conviction that what has been done is
right Develop such conviction in
yourself Kal-El The human heart on
your planet is still subject to small
jealousies lies and monstrous
deceptions Resist these temptations as
you inevitably find them - and your
ethical power will then properly
outweigh your physical advantage over
others

CAMERA BEGINS THIRD SERIES OF DISSOLVES has almost
completed its 360 PAN now starts to RISE behind a giant
representation of JOR-ELS face LOOKING DOWN from
behind through the eyes we see a tiny blue red and
yellow figure in the distance CAMERA PUSHES IN SLOWLY
through the eyes

There is

There is

JOR-EL
Your education nears a kind of
completion now Kal-El although no
limit to understanding or knowledge has
ever truly existed Over the years you
have asked important questions and I
think together we have almost always
found the answer to them Now it is
time for you to return to the world
which I have chosen for you When new
questions arise come back to me and I
will try to be of help

The FIGURE is discernible now as CAMERA PUSHES IN with
increasing speed FOR THE FIRST TIME

SUPERMAN stands in his classic outfit arms folded
gazing intently back up at the CAMERA which represents
JOR-EL He is older now A handsome strong man his
intelligence warmth and compassion shining through his
clear eyes as the final words of JOR-EL flow through
him

JOR-EL
Live as one of them Kal-El to discover
where your strength and power are needed
- but always hold in your heart the
pride of your special heritage Your
being is both separate and your own but
I have caused your earthly presence and
must share responsibility for your
actions They can be a great people
Kal-El They wish to be They only lack
the light to show the way For this
reason above all - their capacity for
good - I have sent them you My only
son

reclines with her feet up in a deep luxurious sofa
working on a needlepoint pillow A projected blue-sky
backdrop shimmers on the wall behind her looking quite
real from this angle and distance EVE is open
straightforward if slightly dim with an unmistakable
honest sexiness about her which matches her personality
She looks up INTO CAMERA wide-eyed disapproving

EVE
Thats sick Lex Really

WIDE ANGLE ON LEX LUTHOR AND LAIR - EVES POV (DAY)

LEX LUTHOR sits behind a massive desk in his palatial
underground lair now seen for the first time as CAMERA
PANS At first glance - breathtaking with its multi-
leveled areas only some of which are immediately
visible The entire wall behind him which rises to a
high ceiling is completely covered with full bookcases
bulging with periodicals papers etc Another separate
area has a complicated laboratory with viewing theater
banks of electronic gadgets which have been connected to
underground electrical lines exposed in portions of the
rock-faced walls In the same manner we will discover
exposed heating ducts and water mains One higher level
near the ceiling is completely blocked from view Off to
another side - a large and colorful aviary stocked with
live birds of prey eagles falcons hawks etc The
walls and ceilings as we will discover are almost all
canvas on which projections can and will be made
different ones servicing different specific parts of the
lair

One other aspect of this underground kingdom will soon
become apparent whether through the architecture which
strangely resembles that of Metropolis Station or the
row of bookcases which curiously look like old ticket
windows or the odd faded track marker which signals
the way off into one or another of the hidden corridors
of the lair - it is clear we are in an abandoned
railroad station drastically remodeled but nonetheless
a fact

CAMERA PUSHES IN ON LEX LUTHOR His face is a task of
elegant demonic Genius for this is a man with an
infinite capacity for sadistic evil Cutting given to
rapidly changing moods but always thinking - the master
criminal incarnate He stares at EVE the only person he
allows to nag him loving her in spite of all LUTHOR
shakes his head sadly disappointed

LUTHOR

Sick

(pause)
Here we sit Miss Teschmacher mere days
away from executing The Crime of the
Century and how do you choose to
congratulate the greatest criminal mind
of our age Do you call me brilliant
A bit obvious that I grant you
Charismatic then

(hopefully)
Fiendishly gifted

EVE goes back to her needlepoint as LUTHOR glares There
is a metallic clank 0S OTIS has entered from a
lower level dutifully approaches the desk holding his
newspaper smiles cheery

OTIS
Im back Mr Luthor

LUTHOR
You were followed again Otis

OTIS looks over his shoulder deeply concerned

LUTHOR
Yes In spite of those cat-like
reflexes

EVE

(new thought)
See if you can just explain to

EVE (CONTD)
me one thing Why do millions of peopl
have to die for this Crime of the
Century Tell me that Lex Why do the
all have to die

LUTHOR

Why

(rising —

philosophical)
Why does the phone always ring when
youre sitting in the tub Why do
restaurants call animal intestines
sweetbreads Why would the most
brilliantly diabolical leader of all
time surround himself with total
incompetents

(to Otis)
Why in fact does the chicken cross t
road

OTIS
(proudly)
To get to the other side

LUTHOR stares at him OTIS hangs his head

OTIS
Im wrong again arent I Mr Luthor

LUTHOR
No Otis As a matter of fact I stuck
that last one in especially for you
(pause)
Is that the newspaper I asked you to g
me

OTIS
Yes sir

LUTHOR
Then why am I not reading it

OTIS
(knows when hes
wrong)
Because I havent given it to you

LUTHOR rips the paper from OTIS hands swats
viciously in the side of the head with it

for that theyll pay through the nose
Remember that my father said Land

resist a small smile

JOR-EL
You are revealed to the world Very
well So be it But still you must keep
your secret identity

SUPERMAN
Why
181A

JOR-EL
The reasons are two First even you
cannot serve humanity twenty-eight hours
a day

SUPERMAN
Twenty-four

JOR-EL
Or twenty-four as it is in Earth time
Your help would be called for endlessly
even for those tasks which human beings
could solve for themselves It is their
habit to abuse their resources in such a
way

SUPERMAN
And secondly

JOR-EL
Second Your enemies will discover their
only way to hurt you - by hurting the
people you care for

SUPERMAN
Thank you Father

JOR-EL

Lastly - do not punish yourself for your

feelings of vanity Simply learn to

control them It is an affliction common

to all even here on Krypton

(expression changes)

our destruction could have been avoided

but for the vanity of some who

considered us indestructible Were it

not for vanity why at this very

moment I could embrace you in my arms

INT LUTHORS LAIR - DAY

CAMERA CLOSE on the front of a newspaper held by EVE who
reads it intently OTIS peering over her shoulder The
banner headline is clearly visible I SPENT THE NIGHT
WITH SUPERMAN - an exclusive interview by Lois Lane
CAMERA PANS to the desk LUTHOR sits behind a massive
pile of books notations calculators etc He works
feverishly with a slide rule his face aglow with
demonic inspiration

LUTHOR

Now then given the location of the
galaxy he mentions

(more slide rule)
And its proximity to our own solar
system amazing

(eyes lighting up)
Too good to be true

EVE
(reading)
You said it six-four blue eyes
doesnt drink tells the truth

LUTHOR suddenly slams the slide rule down on the desk in
a rage It breaks in two part of it whizzing across the
room EVE looks up terrified LUTHOR manages a patient
smile rises

LUTHOR
Some people can read War and Peace and
come away thinking it was a simple
adventure story Others can read the
ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and
unlock the secret of the universe

EVE
(insulted)
I read the article Lex

LUTHOR
Exactly Miss Teschmacher

LUTHOR crosses to the massive wall of books behind him
climbs a large rolling wooden ladder attached to the
shelves He turns to OTIS
6477 T™

LUTHOR
Onward to the letter N Otis Lets
roll

OTIS crosses to the ladder

OTIS
Was that M Mr Luthor

LUTHOR
As in moron No Otis N as in
nitwit nincompoop Neanderthal

OTIS begins to push the rolling ladder along the wall

LUTHOR
(rolling)
Now then According to that interview
the planet Krypton blew up on May 23
1948 The rocket carrying the revolting
little freak took three years to reach
Earth Ergo

OTIS
He is thirty years old

The staircase stops LUTHOR looks down

LUTHOR

Do you know why the number 200 is so

vitally descriptive of both of us Otis

It represents your weight - and my IQ
(turns)

Think people think Deductive

reasoning thats the name of the game

LUTHOR turns dramatically pulls out a specific
periodical starts to leaf through it
6477 T™

LUTHOR
Since fragments of Krypton must have
been shot out into space by the
explosion its reasonable to assume
some of the debris would have landed
here on Earth

EVE
You mean meteorites

LUTHOR
Jawohl

He finds the page he was looking for his face lighting
up EVE and OTIS pick it up eagerly look

LUTHOR
Et voila

LUTHOR lets the periodical sail down to the floor EVE
and OTIS pick it-up eagerly looks

shaped green rock about a foot long and five inches
high The FARMER grins at the camera The caption
beneath reads Meteorite Lands near Addis Ababa

226 BACK TO SCENE
EVE and OTIS stare at the picture mystified

EVE
I know Im going to get rapped in the
mouth for saying this but - so what

LUTHOR
So what You mean to us its just a
meteorite Fair enough
6477 T™

LUTHOR
But because of its high level of
specific radioactivity - to someone from
the planet Krypton - this substance
would be lethal

OTIS
You mean bullets and fire cant hurt
him but this kind of rock

LUTHOR
Will kill him

LUTHOR steps off the ladder beams proudly at EVE

LUTHOR
At times like these you must experience
a certain shudder of ecstasy just being
in the same room with me

EVE
Not like the kind of shudder youre
going to feel when you try and lay that
rock on him He can spot you coming
miles away with those super-peepers of
his

LUTHOR stares up at the ceiling dramatically

LUTHOR

Lord you gave them eyes but they see
not

(quickly)
And neither can Superman - through lead
Four doors Miss Teschmacher lead
doors and he had to rip them all down
to find that poisoned pellet This
bilious bluebird has two Achilles
heels a

NOTE screenplay reformatted 62401 by GR This document is based on the T
Mankiewicz shooting script now widely circulated on the Internet The purpose
of this revision is to increase legibility by standardizing the formatting
throughout the document The alterations made are primarily ones involving
indentation page breaks capitalization and punctuation Spelling has been
preserved to match the previous text source except in cases where obvious
mistakes were made many of which seemed to be caused by the limitations of OCR
software One additional exception is that British spellings have been
Americanized although a future revision may reverse those changes No attempt
has been made to reconceive the screenplay’s original pagination that is
referred to occasionally within the document None of the notes (excepting this
one) within the text are mine but rather that of the original screenwriters or
those first responsible for bringing the text to a digital format While I
attempted to emulate the formatting of other professionally drafted screenplays
I am not a professional and do not have access to the film’s original screenplay
sources Therefore this is not to be understood as a definitive shooting
script for Superman The Movie but hopefully an improvement upon what has been
available
