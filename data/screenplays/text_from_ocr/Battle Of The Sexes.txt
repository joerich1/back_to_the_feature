MONTAGE 1

Huge on the screen A plastic doll stares at us A commercial
for Talky Crissy

TALKY CRISSY
Hi Please dry my hair

vO
All girls love Talky Crissy with
her growing hair

The screen divides in two to accommodate both Talky Crissy
and a squadron of B52s unloading its cargo Hundreds of bombs
unzip the sky

vO (CONTD)
« aS the last US ground troops
are withdrawn from Vietnam the
bombing continues

The screen divides into smaller squares accommodating the
best and the worst of the early 1970s Clips of Hawaii Five-
O Heres Lucy The Mary Tyler Moore Show stills from
commercials documentary footage from Town Bloody Hall each
taking centre screen for a few seconds and then shrinking to
allow the next clip to take precedence

“The Kenwood Chef does everything but cook That’s what wives
are for”

“Flying Dutchman tobacco lead Women around by the nose”

“Don’t worry darling you didn’t burn the beer Schlitz
Malt”

Then a news clip takes centre screen

NEWSCASTER
Good evening in a landmark ruling
the Supreme Court today legalized
abortions A majority from Texas
and Georgia said that the decision
to end a pregnancy during the first
three months belongs to a woman and
her doctor not the government

Town Bloody Hall takes precedence as a woman in the audience
accuses Norman Mailer on the stage

TOWN BLOODY HALL
the dog talks you know That a
woman should talk at all is
something you are finding a little
hard to take

But there’s someone new in town

EXT FOREST HILLS TENNIS COURT US OPEN DAY 1A

BILLIE JEAN KING’s 29 year-old face big on the screen
concentrating hard We hear a grunt and the noise of a serve
A flash and Billie Jean has reached the ball returned it

The ball comes back but she is across the court with
lightning speed and putting every ounce of energy into the
shot returns it again

We are inside her head only the sound of her furious
breathing the ball and the squeak of tennis shoes can be
heard

Back comes the ball again and again each time Billie Jean
punches it back until

-The world crashes in a sudden surge of applause and
cheering The focus on Billie Jean’s face finally relaxes
into a huge smile of triumph

UMPIRE VO
Game set and match to Miss King

She throws the racket high into the air and we see she is
surrounded by thousands of fans applauding wildly

LARRY KING Billie Jean’s husband jumps onto the court and
embraces her

With five Wimbledon titles a

scrunched up paper expertly into the trash wanders back
behind a large largely empty desk He sets the Newton’s
Cradle desk toy going his eyes following it’s progress back

Hi Bobby

BOBBY RIGGS

says My wife Lovely lady

His face briefly shines and then he remembers

BOBBY RIGGS (CONTD)
She’s gonna leave me unless I quit
gambling

A couple of ‘we hear you Bobby’s from the room

BOBBY RIGGS (CONTD)
Puzzles me this word gambling
Every time she gets the car out the
garage Priscilla’s gambling big
time Never checks the mirror
sticks it in reverse puts her foot
down straight out onto the
highway Jeez Louise that’s
gambling But here I am Gamblers
Anonymous

GAMBLERS ANON LEADER
And what’s your point Bobby

BOBBY RIGGS
My point Everybody gambles all the
time Life’s a gamble right
That’s the thrill of it this way
or that way the yes or the no the
heads or the tails of being alive
Yet here I am and here you are
heads bowed ashamed of ourselves
But that ain’t right You fellas
aren’t here cos you’‘re gamblers-—
were all gamblers You’re here cos
youre terrible gamblers That’s
what the problem is You lose
right And you end up here

More ashamed nods from the Gamblers

BOBBY RIGGS (CONT’D)
I get it But there’s one thing
worse than losing friends it’s
not being in the game If youre
not in game what’s the point
(MORE )
BATTLE OF THE SEXES - Simon Work File - 4716 6-7

This is taking a surprising turn Even Bobby is cheering up

BOBBY RIGGS (CONT’D)
Heads up fellas we can turn this
around we can get back in the
game we will get back in the
game

Everyone’s listening now This isn’t the inspirational speech
they were expecting but they like it

GAMBLERS ANON LEADER

BOBBY RIGGS

I play a bit of cards but sports
is my bag tennis golf shooting
hoops whatever it is there’s a
bet to made And if there isn’t I
don’t get out of bed I hear you
guys yammering on and I realized
I see the problem What you gotta
do is get yourselves a thing

GAMBLER
A thing

BOBBY RIGGS
Yeah a thing An edge an angle
the inside track the sniff in the
wind the thing that turns you from
a gambler to a hustler froma
loser to a winner A thing

GAMBLERS ANON LEADER

don’t make each other happy

LARRY
I’m happy And if there’s more I
can do to make you happy tell me

not

Larry comes up to her and takes the necklace from her Starts
to put it on

We’ve had our moments- which
marriage doesn’t- but we’ve got

GLADYS HELDMAN a feisty forty-year old marches onto the

GLADYS
Have you seen this

BILLIE JEAN
Hey Gladys
BATTLE OF THE SEXES - Simon Work File - 4716 9

LARRY
You want a dance

GLADYS
I want a gun They’ve just snuck
out this press release the low-
lifes

Gladys waves a piece of paper in front of Billie Billie
grabs it Reads

LARRY
Which low-lifes

GLADYS
Our so-called friends the United
States Lawn Tennis Association

Gladys jabs a finger at one particular line Billie Jeans
eyes widen

BILLIE JEAN
What This is outrageous

GLADYS
It’s got Jack Kramer’s fingerprints
all over it

BILLIE JEAN
Absolutely right And I know where
he’s hiding Come on Gladys

She grabs Gladys and they march off the dance floor

LARRY
Good luck

INT FOREST HILLS CLUB -- LIBRARY EVENING

JACK KRAMER and BOB SANDERS are sitting in club chairs

relaxing DANA a young waitress hands them whiskies

JACK KRAMER
Thank you honey

DANA
Sure Mister Kramer

He follows the rear view with his eyes as she goes

Gladys and Billie Jean come marching in

GLADYS
Surprised in their lair

JACK KRAMER
An unexpected pleasure ladies You
both look sensational if I may
say

GLADYS
You may not

BOB SANDERS
Youre not supposed to be in here
you know--

GLADYS
- because I’m a woman or a Jew

JACK KRAMER
Oh we have a Jewish member now
Don’t we Bob

BOB SANDERS
One black member as well

GLADYS
Progress

BILLIE JEAN
But no women

BOB SANDERS
Not as yet no

Jack pats a seat for Gladys oblivious to the daggers

his way

JACK KRAMER
What can we do for you ladies
Glass of something

shot
BATTLE OF THE SEXES - Simon Work File - 4716 11

Gladys sits gets out a cigarette Bob leans forward to light
it She pointedly lights it herself

GLADYS
I always find it’s best to be clear
before committing cold-blooded
murder so to clarify the Pacific
Southwest Tournament press release

She bangs the offending piece of paper down on the coffee
table rattling the china

JACK KRAMER
Ah Yes

BILLIE JEAN
It says you’re offering twelve
thousand dollars to the men’s
winner and one thousand five
hundred dollars to the women’s

GLADYS
That’s either a misprint or a
provocation I might get off with
manslaughter

JACK KRAMER
No those are the terms

BOB SANDERS
The men’s prize has to be that high
to attract the best players We’re
trying to make this the most
prestigious tournament in America

GLADYS
And paying the women players less
than ever makes it more
prestigious Aha I get it I see
the logic Hallelujah my eyes have
been opened

BILLIE JEAN
-Gladys

Said quietly but firmly Everybody takes notice
GLADYS
Youre lucky she’s here She’s like
the bomb disposal squad-
BILLIE JEAN
(firmer)
- Gladys

A huff from Gladys Silence
BATTLE OF THE SEXES - Simon Work File - 4716 12

BILLIE JEAN (CONTD)
Can I just bring it back around to
the money Jack

JACK KRAMER
You know I’m sympathetic to your
cause Billie Jean We’ve talked
about this--

BILLIE JEAN
We have Many times You promised
this year would be different

JACK KRAMER
It’s simply a question of what we
can afford

BOB SANDERS
People come to see the men play
They’re the draw

BILLIE JEAN
Eight times more of a draw

BOB SANDERS
Sorry

BILLIE JEAN
Youre offering the men’s winner
exactly eight times more than the
women’s winner Do we bring in an
eighth of the crowd

BOB SANDERS
I don’t know the percentages--

BILLIE JEAN
They sold the exact same number of
tickets today for the women’s final
as the men’s final Isn’t that
right Jack

JACK
I suppose so

GLADYS
Same sales same prize money Seems
fair to me

JACK KRAMER
Be reasonable there’s no way we
can afford that
BATTLE OF THE SEXES - Simon Work File - 4716

BILLIE JEAN
Then what’s your argument Just
give me a logical argument why you
should pay a woman an eighth of
what you pay a man and I promise
Ill stop asking

JACK KRAMER
Well for one thing the men have
to support their families

BILLIE JEAN
I’m the main bread winner in my
family

JACK KRAMER
Look The men are simply more
exciting to watch They’re faster--

BOB SANDERS

-fact-

JACK KRAMER
-stronger-

BOB SANDERS
-fact-

JACK KRAMER
-more competitive-

BOB SANDERS
-just a fact

JACK KRAMER
It’s not your fault It’s biology

BILLIE JEAN
That’s the best argument you’ve
got Really

JACK KRAMER
It’s just the way it is

BILLIE JEAN
Well boycott the tournament

GLADYS
Fact

JACK KRAMER
We’d sure miss your pretty faces
butgo right ahead

BATTLE OF THE SEXES - Simon Work File - 4716 14

BILLIE JEAN
Not only will we boycott we’ll set
up our own tournament

A flicker of panic from Gladys

GLADYS
Fact

BILLIE JEAN
At the exact same time as the
Pacific Southwest

GLADYS
Um Fact

Jack Kramer and Bob Sanders exchange a look Jack smiles and
stands

JACK KRAMER
Well be sure and send me tickets
You have a good night ladies

He holds open the library door for them

Another silence Bobby’s son peppers his food with a outsize
pepper grinder Appraises it

BOBBYS SON

PRISCILLA
It’s not how much it’s how many
And stop wondering Or you can go

educational question right

BOBBY RIGGS
(cracking)

No way there’s at least five

thousand in there

BOBBYS SON

PRISCILLA

Bobby’s son gives the pepper grinder another provocative

twist winks at his Dad and mouths “one dollar”

BOBBY RIGGS

Absolutely not young man We do

not gamble at the table

PRISCILLA

We do not gamble any place Bobby

BOBBY RIGGS
Exactly Any place

Bobby pats his mouth with his napkin Dabs at the sweat

Bizarrely two Alsatians are bounding around a tennis court
Bobby on the end of their lead being towed after them On
the other side of the net is JACK retired business tycoon
and amateur tennis player

Equally bizarre is the location of the court on the flat
roof of a skyscraper near the belching smoke stacks of the
Con Edison Power Plant

Loving the show are the Boys HANK ex-baseball pro retired
KEN and gentle HERB a tennis star in the 50’s now ina
wheelchair and LORNIE KUHLE younger friend of Bobby’s and
tennis pro

Somehow Bobby manages to reach the ball and get it back over
the net The Boys are loving it the dogs are loving it and
most of all so is Bobby

JACK
Dammit Bobby

BOBBY RIGGS
Teach them to serve and we could
get them on the Circuit Good boys
good boys go go

He wins the point

KEN
A chair C’mon guys

BOBBY RIGGS
Two chairs and I’ll raise you both
five hundred

KEN HERB
Done Take him Jack

Lornie rushes two chairs onto Bobby’s side of the court that
he now has to dodge around with the dogs Chaos Bobby is
leaping over the chairs getting the lead tangled in the
legsand yet somehow the ball keeps being returned

More dollars are put down on the table by the Boys There’s
big money on this game

A fierce exchange of shots culminating in a lot of barking
and a massive lob from Bobby Everyone watches its progress
high into the sky and then down on the baseline Right on the
baseline Jack scrabbles back for it Doesn’t get there

Bobby leaps the net shakes his hand

BOBBY RIGGS
Good game Jack
BATTLE OF THE SEXES - Simon Work File - 4716 18

Dammit I thought I had you this
time Bobby I really did

Dejected he walks off The boys watch him go

BOBBY RIGGS
He keeps betting me What do I do

HANK
Thing about Jack is- he can afford
to lose

Jack gets the car keys from the bowl in the middle of the
table Throws them to Bobby Towels his face down

LORNIE
What’s Priscilla going to say
Bobby That’s what you gotta ask
yourself

BOBBY RIGGS
Don’t spoil it Jack you know

HERB
Priscilla You still married
Bobby

KEN

He sure will be if he turns up ina
Rolls Royce

LORNIE
He sure won’t be if he turns up in
a Rolls Royce

HERB
Whadd’ya mean

LORNIE
You think Priscilla wont know
where it came from Even Bobby’s
gonna find it hard talking that one
away “Hi honey this guy on the
corner just gave me a Silver
Shadow” Think that’1l cut it

HERB
What’s to talk away You’ve just
won a damned Rolls Royce

LORNIE
Herb Bobby doesn’t gamble anymore

HERB

Absolutely A reformed character
That’s what my psychoanalyst’s
report says and Priscilla’s very
happy about that I can tell you

HERB
How did you ever get the shrink to
write that

BOBBY RIGGS
The chump keeps losing at Black
Jack But Lornie’s got a point
It’s a big car to hide in a drawer
No hurry Jack

Bobby throws the keys back

JACK

HANK
Reckons she should get more Same

thousand dollars now That Billie
Jean King Just what is her
problem

HANK
It’s all equality this equality
that now Bobby Bra burning and
the like

BOBBY RIGGS
Why would they pay women the same
as the guys Why would they

HERB
I say there’s nothing wrong with
watching a nice girl in a short
skirt running after a ball

BOBBY RIGGS
No argument there Jack but I
could beat any woman on the planet
Any of them And what are they
paying me on the Seniors Anybody
offering me equal prize money No
sir Peanuts that’s what I’m
getting Peanuts

Silence Then

HANK
That would be a bet
