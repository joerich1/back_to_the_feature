ACT I
SCENE ONE

500 PM The Street
A suggestion of city streets and alleyways

a brick wall
The opening is musical half-danced half-mimed with
occasional phrases of dialogue It is primarily a condensation of
the growing rivalry between two teen-age games the Jets and the
Sharks each of which has its own prideful uniform The boys -
sideburned long-haired- are vital restless sardonic the
Sharks are Puerto Ricans the Jets an anthology of what is called
American

The action begins with the Jets in possession of the are
owning enjoying loving their home Their leader is Riff
glowing driving intelligent slightly wacky His lieutenant is
Deisel big slow steady nice The youngest member of the gang
is Baby John awed at everything including that he is a Jet
trying to act the big man His buddy is A-rab an explosive
little ferret who enjoys everything and understands the
seriousness of nothing The most aggressive is Action a catlike
ball of fury We will get to know these boys better later as
well as Snowboy a bespectacled self-styled expert

The first interruption of the Jets sunny mood is the
sharply punctuated entrance of the leader of the Sharks
Bernardo handsome proud fluid a chip on his sardonic shoulder
The Jets by far in the majority flick him off He returns with
other Sharks they too are flicked off But the numerical
supremacy the strength of the Jets is gradually being
threatened The beginnings of warfare are mild at first a boy
being tripped up or being sandbagged with a flour sack or even
being spit on -all with overly elaborate apologies

Finally A-rab comes across the suddenly deserted area
pretending to be an airplane There is no sound as he zooms along
in fancied flight Then over the wall drops Bernardo Another
Shark another and another appear blocking A-rabs panicky
efforts at escape They close in grab him pummel him as a
Shark on top of the wall is stationed as lookout Finally
Bernardo bends over A-rab and makes a gesture (piercing his ear)
the lookout whistles Jets tear on Sharks tear on and a free-
for-all breaks out Riff goes at once to A-rab like a protective
father The fight is stopped by a police whistle louder and
louder and the arrival of a big goonlike cop Krupke anda
plainclothesman Schrank Schrank is strong always in command
he has a charming pleasant manner which he often employs to
cover his venom and his fear

KRUPKE
Knock it off Settle down

SCHRANK
All right Kill each other But not on my beat

RIFF such innocence
Why if it isnt Lieutenant Schrank

SEVERAL JETS dancing class manners
To of the day Lieutenant Schrank
BERNARDO one with Riff
And Officer Krupke

SEVERAL SHARKS
Top of the day Officer Krupke

SCHRANK
Boy what you Puerto Ricans have done to this neighborhood Which
one of em clobbered ya A-rab

A-rab looks to Riff who takes over with great helpful
seriousness

RIFF
As a matter of factuality sir we suspicion the job was done by
a cop

SNOWBOY
Two cops

A-RAB
Oh at least

KRUPKE
Impossible

SCHRANK
Didnt nobody tell ya theres a difference between bein a stool
pigeon and cooperatin with the law

RIFF
You told us the difference sir And we all chipped in for a
prize for the first guy who can figure it out

ACTION indicating Schrank
Maybe buddy boy should get the prize

SCHRANK

And whatre we doin about it
Pushing through the game comes a scrawny teen-age girl dressed
in an outfit that is a pathetic attempt to imitate that of the
Jets Perhaps we have glimpsed her in the fracas before the
police am e in Her name is Anybodys

and pushes her out

RIFF
The road little lady the road In a moment of bravado just
before she goes Anybodys spits-but cautiously Round out This
is Riffs summoning of the gang and they surround him We
fought hard for this territory and its ours But with those cops
servin as cover the PRs can move in right under our noses and
take it away Unless we speed fast and clean em up in one all-
out fight

ACTION eagerly

Itll be there

Meet a guy

Pull up a chair

The air is humming

And something great is coming
Who knows

Down the block on a beach
Maybe tonight

The Lights Dim

SCENE THREE

600 PM A bridal shop

A small section enough to include a table with sewing
machine a chair or two Anita A Puerto Rican girl with loose
hair and slightly flashy clothes is finishing remaking what was
a white communion dress into a party dress for an extremely
lovely extremely young girl Maria Anita is knowing a sexual
sharp Maria is an excited enthusiastic obedient child with
the temper stubborn strength and awareness of a woman

MARIA holding out scissors
Por favor Anita Make the neck lower

ANITA
Stop it Maria

MARIA
One inch How much can one little inch do

ANITA
Too much

MARIA exasperated
Anita it is now to be a dress of dancing no longer for kneeling
in front of an altar

ANITA
With those boys you can start in dancing and end up kneeling

MARIA
Querida one little inch uno poca poca-

ANITA
Bernardo made me promise-

MARIA
Ai Bernardo One month have I been in this country-do I ever
even touch excitement I sew all day I sit all night For what
did my fine brother bring me here

ANITA
To marry Chino

MARIA
When I look at Chino nothing happens

ANITA
What do you expect to happen

MARIA
I dont know something What happens when you look at Bernardo

ANITA
Its when I dont look at him that it happens

MARIA
I think I will tell Mama and Papa about you and Nardo in the
balcony of the movies

ANITA
I will rip this to shreds

MARIA
No But you perhaps could manage to lower the neck-
ANITA
Next year

MARIA
Next year I will be married an no one will care if its down to
here

ANITA
Down to where

MARIA
Down to here Indicates her waist I hate this dress

ANITA
Then dont wear it and dont come to the dance

MARIA shocked
Dont come Grabs the dress Could we not dye it red at least

ANITA
No we could not She starts to help Maria into the dress

MARIA
White is for babies I will be the only one there in a white-

ANITA
Well

MARIA
Ahhhh-si It is a beautiful dress I love you
As she hugs Anita Bernardo enters followed by a shy gentle
sweet-faced boy Chino
BERNARDO
Are you ready

MARIA
Come in Nardo Whirls in the dress Is it not beautiful

BERNARDO looking only at Marias face
Yes Kisses her Very

ANITA
I didnt quite hear

BERNARDO kissin Anita quite differently
Very beautiful

MARIA
watches them a second then turns to Chino
Come in Chino Do not be afraid

CHINO
But this is a shop for ladies

BERNARDO
Our ladies
MARIA
Nardo it is most important that I have a wonderful time at the
dancing tonight

BENARDO as Anita hooks up Maria
Why

MARIA
Because tonight is the real beginning of my life as a young lady
of America

She begins to whirl in the dress as the shop slides off
and a flood of gaily colored streamers pours down As Maria
begins to turn and turn going off-stage Sharks girls dressed
for the dance whirl on followed by Jet girls By boys from both
gangs The streamers fly up again for the next scene

SCENE FOUR

1000 PM The gym

Actually a converted gymnasium of a settlement house at
the moment being used as a dancehall disguised for the occasion
with streamers and bunting

Both gangs are jitterbugging wildly with their bodies but
their faces although they are enjoying themselves remain cool
almost detached The line between the two gangs is sharply
defined by the colors they wear the Jets girls as well as boys
reflecting the colors of the Jets jackets the same is true of
the Sharks The dancing is a physical and emotional release for
these kids

Maria enters with Chino Bernardo and Anita As she looks
around delighted thrilled by this her first dance the Jets
catch sight of Bernardo who is being greeted by Pepe his
lieutenant and other Sharks As the music peters away the Jets
withdraw to one side of the hall around Riff The Sharks seeing
this draw to their side around Bernardo who starts-with his
lieutenants-to meet him The moment is brief but it would be
disastrous if a smiling overly cheerful young man of about
thirty did not hurry forward He is called Glad Hand and he is a
square

GLAD HAND beaming
All right boys and girls Attention please Hum of talk
Attention Krupke appears behind Glad Hand the talk stops
Thank you It sure is fine turnout tonight Ad libs from the
kids We want to make friends here so were going to have a few
get-together dances Ad libs Oh ginger peachy ect You
form two circles boys on the outside and girls on the inside

SNOWBOY
Where are you

GLAD HAND tries to laugh at this
All right Now when the music stops each boy dances with
whichever girl is opposite OK OK Two circles kids The
kids clap their hands back at him and ad lib Two circles
kids ect but do not move Well it wont hurt you to try

SNOWBOY limping forward
Oh it hurts it hurts it-

Krupke steps forward Snowboy straightens up and meekly
returns to his place Riff steps forward and beckons to his girl
Velma She is terribly young sexy lost in a world of jive She
slithers forward to take her place with Riff The challenge is
met by Bernardo who steps forward leading Anita as though he
were presenting the most magnificent lady in all the world The
other kids follow forming the two circles Glad Hand requested

GLAD HAND
Thats it kids Keep the ball rolling Round she goes and where
she stops nobody knows All right here we go
Promenade music starts and the circles start revolving Glad
Hand whistles to this mouth is in the center with Krupke He
blows the whistle and the music stops leaving the Jet boys
opposite Sharks girls and vice versa There is a moment of
tenseness then Bernardo reaches across the Jet girl opposite for
Anitas hand and she comes to him Riff reaches for Velma and
the kids of both gangs follow suit The get-together has
failed and each gang is on its own side of the hall as a mambo
starts This turns into a challenge dance between Bernardo and
Anita-cheered on by the Sharks-and Riff and Velma-cheered on by
the Jets During it Tony enters and is momentarily embraced by
Riff who is delighted that his best friend did turn up The
dance builds wilder and wilder until at the peak everybody is
dancing and shouting Go Mambo It is at this moment that Tony
and Maria-at opposite sides of the hall-see each other They have
been cheering on their respective friends clapping in rhythm
Now as they s

TONY
Youre not thinking Im someone else

MARIA
I know you are not

TONY
Or that we have met before

MARIA
I know we have not

TONY
I felt I knew something-never-before was going to happen had to
happen But this is-

MARIA interrupting
My hands are cold He takes them in his Yours too He moves
her hand to his face So warm She moves his hands to her
face

TONY
Yours too
MARIA
But of course They are the same

TONY
Its so much to believe-youre not joking me

MARIA
I have not yet learned how to joke that way I think now I never
will
Impulsively he stops to kiss her hands then tenderly
innocently her lips The music bursts out the lights flare up
and Bernardo is upon them in an icy rage

BERNARDO
Go home American

TONY
Slow down Bernardo

BERNARDO
Stay away from my sister

TONY
Sister
Riff steps up

BERNARDO to Maria
Couldnt you see hes one of them

MARIA
No I saw only him

BERNARDO as Chino comes up
I told you theres one thing they want from a Puerto Rican girl

TONY
Thats a lie

RIFF
Cool boy

Chino to Tony
Get away

TONY
You keep out Chino To Maria Dont listen to them

BERNARDO
She will listen to brother before-

RIFF overlapping
If you characters want to settle-

GLAD HAND
Please Everything was going so well Do you fellows get pleasure
out of making trouble Now come on-it wont hurt you to have a
good time

Music starts again Bernardo is on one side with Maria and
Chino Anita joins them Tony is on the other with Riff and
Diesel Light emphasizes the first group

BERNARDO

I warned you-

CHINO
Do not yell at her Nardo

BERNARDO
You yell at babies

ANITA
And put ideas in the babys head

BERNARDO
Take her home Chino

MARIA
Nardo it is my first dance

BERNARDO
Please We are family Maria Go
Maria hesitates then starts out with Chino as the light follows
her to the other group which she passes

RIFF to Diesel indicating Tony happily
I guess the kids with us for sure now

Tony doesnt even hear he is starting at Maria who stops
for a moment

CHINO
Come Maria
They continue out

TONY
Maria

He is unaware that Bernardo is crossing toward him but
Riff intercepts

BERNARDO
I dont want you

RIFF
I want you though For a war council-Jets and Sharks

BERNARDO
The pleasure is all mine

RIFF
Lets go outside

BERNARDO
I would not leave the ladies here alone We will meet you in half
an hour
RIFF

They look at each other then at the reality of their game
They smile tenderly ruefully and slowly put the dummies back
into position Though brought back to earth they continue to
sing

Make of our lives one life

Day after day one life

Now it begins now we start

One hand one heart-

Even death wont part us now

Very gently he kisses her hand

SCENE NINE

900 PM Under the highway

A dead end rotting plaster-and-brick walls and mesh wire
fences A street lamp

It is nightfall The almost-silhouetted gangs come in from
separate sides climbing over the fences or crawling through
holes in the walls There is silence as they fan out on opposite
sides of the cleared space Then Bernardo and Diesel remove their
jackets handing them to their second Chino and Riff

Bernardo knocks the hand away and gives Tony a shove that sends
him sprawling

BERNARDO

BERNARDO
Come on you yellow-bellied Polack bas-
He never finishes for Riff hauls off and hits him Immediately
the two gangs alert and the following action takes on the form
of a dance As Bernardo reels back to his feet he reaches for
his back pocket Riff reaches for his back pocket and at the
same instant each forth a gleaming knife They jockey for
position feinting dueling the two gangs shift position now
and again temporarily obscuring the fighters Tony tries to get
between them

RIFF
Hold him
Diesel and Action grab Tony and hold him back The fight
continues Riff loses his knife is passed another by a Jet At
last he has Bernardo in a position where it seems that he will
be able to run him through Tony breaks from Diesel and crying
out moves to stop Riff

TONY
Riff dont Riff hesitates a moment the moments is enough for
Bernardo-whose hand goes forward with a driving motion running
his knife into Riff Tony leaps forward to catch Riff He breaks
his fall then takes the knife in hand leaps at the triumphant
Bernardo All this happens terribly fast and Tony rams his knife
into Bernardo The free-for-all continues a moment longer Then
there is a sharp police whistle Everything comes to a dead stop-
dead silence Then a distant police siren the kids waver run
one way another in panic confusion As the stage is cleared
Tony stands horrified over the still bodies of Riff and
Bernardo He bends over Riffs body then he rolls Bernardos
body over-and stares Then Tony raises his voice in an anguished
cry
MARIA
Another police whistle closer now but he doesnt move From
the shadows Anybodys appears She scurries to Tony and tugs at
his arm A siren another whistle then a searchlight cuts across
the playground Anybodys insistent tugging brings Tony to the
realization of the danger He crouches starts to run with her
to one escape way She reaches it first goes out-but the
searchlight hits it just as he would go through He stops runs
the other way He darts here there and finally gets away as a
distant clock begins to boom

And entrancing

Feel like running and dancing for joy
For Im loved

By a pretty wonderful boy

ROSALIA and CONSUELO
Have you met my good friend Maria
The craziest girl on the block
Youll know her the minute you see her
Shes the one who is in an advanced state of

She thinks shes in love
She thinks shes in Spain
She isnt in love

Shes merely insane

It must be the heat
Or some rare disease
Or too much to eat
Or maybe its fleas

Keep away from her
Send for Chino
This is not the Maria we know

Modest and pure
Polite and refined
Well-bred and mature
And out of her mind

MARIA
I feel pretty
Oh so pretty
That the city should give me its key
A committee
Should be organized to honor me

I feel dizzy

I feel sunny

I feel fizzy and funny and fine

And so pretty

Miss America can just resign

See the pretty girl in that mirror there

ROSALIA and CONSUELO
What mirror where

MARIA
Who can that attractive girl be

Feel like running and dancing for joy
For Im loved

By a pretty wonderful boy

CHINO closer
Maria

MARIA
Please-

COSUELO
Yes little bride were going
She exits

ROSALIA
They have a quaint old-fashioned custom in this country Maria
they get married here before the wedding night She follows
Consuelo out as Chino enters from offstage His clothes are dirty
and torn from the fight His face is smeared They shake their
heads at him and flounce out He closes the outer door

CHINO
Maria

MARIA
Im in here I was just getting ready to-She is hurriedly trying
to put a bathrobe over her dress Chino comes in before she can
finish so that she leaves it over her shoulders holding it
closed with her hands

CHINO
Where are your parents

MARIA
At the store If I had known you were-You have been fighting
Chino
CHINO
Yes Im sorry

MARIA
That is not like you

CHINO
No

MARIA

CHINO
I dont know why It happened so fast

MARIA

CHINO
In a minute Maria at the rumble-

MARIA
There was no rumble

CHINO

MARIA

CHINO

No there was Nobody meant for it to happen

MARIA
-Tell me

CHINO

MARIA
Very bad

CHINO
You see he moves to her helplessly

MARIA
It will be easier if you say it very fast

CHINO nods
There was a fight-She nods And Nardo-She

nods

And

somehow
a knife-and Nardo someone-He takes her hand

MARIA
Tony What happened to Tony The name stops Chino He yanks off
the robe revealing that she is dressed to go out Chino is
Tony all right

CHINO
He killed your brother She walks into the parlor slamming the
door behind him A pause

MARIA
You are lying Chino has started to leave the parlor but comes
back now Swiftly searching behind the furniture he come up with
an object wrapped in material the same color as Bernardos
shirt From the bedroom Marias voice calls out louder You
are lying Chino Coldly Chino unwraps a gun which he puts in
his pocket There is the sound of a police siren at a distance
He goes out During this Maria has knelt before the shrine on
the wall She rocks back and forth in prayer some of it in
Spanish some of it in English Make it not be true please
make it not be true I will do anything make me die Only
please-make it not be true As she prays Tony appears at the
fire-escape window and quietly climbs in His shirt is ripped
half-torn off He stands still limp watching her Aware that
someone is in the room she tops her prayers Slowly her head
turns she looks at him for a long moment Then almost in one
spring she in on him her fists beating his chest Killer
killer killer

TONY
I tried to stop it I did try I dont know how it went wrong
I didnt mean to hurt him I didnt want to I didnt know I had
But Riff Riff was like my brother So when Bernardo killed
him-She lifts her head Nardo didnt mean it either Oh I
dont know he didnt Oh no I didnt come to tell you just for
you to forgive me so I couldnt go to the police-

MARIA
No

TONY
Its easy now-

MARIA
No

TONY
Whatever you want Ill do-

MARIA
Stay Stay with me

TONY
I love you so much

MARIA
Tighter
Music starts

TONY
Well be all right I know it Were really together now

MARIA
But its not us Its everything around us

TONY
Then well find some place where nothing can et to us not one of
them not anything And-
He sings
Ill take you away take you far far away out of here
Far far away till the walls and the streets disappear
Somewhere there must be a place we can feel were free
Somewhere theres got to be some place for you and for me
As he sings the walls of the apartment begin to move off and
the city walls surrounding them begin to close in on them Then
the apartment it self goes and the two lovers begin to run
battering against the walls of the city beginning to break
through as chaotic figures of the gangs of violence fail around
them But they do break through and suddenly-they are in a world
of space and air and sun They stop looking at it pleased
startled as boys and girls both sides come on And they too
stop and stare happy pleased Their clothes are soft and pastel
versions of what they have worn before They begin to dance to
play no sides no hostility now join making a world that Tony
and Maria want to be in belong to share their love with As
they go into the steps of a gentle love dance a voice is heard
singing

OFFSTAGE VOICE sings
Theres a place for us
Somewhere a place for us
Peace and quiet and open air
Wait for us
Somewhere

Theres a time for us

Some day a time for us

Time together with time to spare
Time to look time to care
Someday

Somewhere

Well find a new way of living
Well find a way of forgiving
Somewhere

Somewhere

Theres a place for us

A time and place for us

Hold my hand and were half way there
Hold my hand and Ill take you there
Someday

Somehow
Somewhere

The lovers hold out their hands to each other the others follow
suit Jets to Sharks Sharks to Jets And they form what is
almost a procession winding its triumphant way through this
would-be world as they sing the words of the song with
wonderment Then suddenly there is a dead stop The harsh
shadows the fire escapes of the real tenement world cloud the
sky and the figures of Riff and Bernardo slowly walk on The
dream becomes a nightmare as the city returns there are brief
reenactments of the knife fight of the deaths Maria and Tony
are once again separated from each other by the violent warring
of the two sides Maria tries to reach Bernardo Tony tries to
stop Riff the lovers try to reach each other but they cannot
Chaotic confusion and blackness after which they find
themselves back in the bedroom clinging to each other
desperately With a blind refusal to face what they know must be
they reassure each other desperately as they sing

TONY and MARIA
Hold my hand and were halfway there
Home my hand and Ill take you there
Someday
Somehow
Somewhere
As the lights fade together they sink back on the bed

SCENE TWO
1000 PM Another alley

A fence with loose boards angles between buildings
Softly from behind the fence the Jet gang whistles A pause

SCENE THREE

1130 PM The bedroom

The light is at first a vague glow on the lovers who are
sleep on the bed From offstage faint at first there is the
sound of knocking It gets louder Tony stirs At a distance a
police siren sounds and the knocking is now very loud Tony
bolts upright Anita comes in from outside and goes to the
bedroom door-which is locked-tries the knob

ANITA holding back tears
Maria Maria Tony is reaching for his shirt when Maria
sits up Quickly he puts his hand then his lips on her lips
Maria its Anita Why are you locked in

MARIA

MARIA a whisper

TONY whispering

drugstore
In the other room Anita is aware of voices but unsure of
what they are saying
At Docs yes Aloud Coming Anita

TONY kisses her
Hurry
He scrambles out the window as Maria hastily puts a bathrobe on
over her slip In the other room Anita has stiffened and moved
away from the door She stands staring at it coldly as Maria
prattles to her through the door

MARIA
Did you see Chino He was here before but he left so angry I
think maybe he She opens the door and sees Anitas look A

moment then Anita pushes her aside looks at the bed at the
window then turns accusingly to Maria All right Now you know

ANITA savagely
And you still dont know Tony is one of them
She sings bitterly
A boy like that whod kill your brother
Forget that boy and find another
One of your own kind-
Stick to your own kind

A boy like that will give you sorrow-
Youll meet another boy tomorrow

One of your own kind

Stick to your own kind

A boy who kills has no heart

And hes the boy who gets your love
And gets your heart-

Very smart Maria very smart

And when hes done hell leave you lonely
Hell murder your love he murdered mine
Just wait and see-

And in my head
I know theyre smart
But my heart Anita
But my heart

Anita reprises the chorus she has just sung as Maria continues
her song
And my heart
Is too strong
For I belong
To him alone to him alone
One thing I know

I am his
I dont care what he is

I dont know why its so

I dont want to know

Oh no Anita no-you should know better
You were in love-or so you said

You should know better

I have a love and its all that I have
Right or wrong what else can I do

I love him Im his
And everything he is
I am too

I have a love and its all that I need
Right or wrong and he needs me too

I love him were one

Theres nothing to be done

Not a thing I can do

But hold him hold him forever

Be with him now tomorrow

And all of my life

BOTH
When love comes so strong
There is no right or wrong
Your love is your life

ANITA quietly

door As he does the set flies away and the stage goes dark In
the darkness we heaver Tonys voice

TONY
Chino Chino Come and get me too Chino

SCENE SIX
Midnight The street

The lights come up to reveal the same set we saw at the
beginning of Act One-but it is now jagged with shadows Tony

steps out of the dark He stops and peers as light starts to glow

on it He utters an unbelieving whisper Maria Maria
MARIA
Tony As she holds out her arms toward him another figure

appears Chino
TONY

MARIA As they run to each other there is a gunshot Tony
stumbles as though he has tripped Maria catches him and cradles
him in her arms as he falters to the ground During this Baby
John and A-rab run on then Pepe and Indio and other Sharks

Chino stands very still bewildered by the gun dangling from his
hand More Jets and Sharks some girls run on and Doc comes out
to stare with them I didnt believe hard enough

MARIA
Long is enough

TONY
Not here They wont let us be

MARIA
Then well get away

TONY
Yes we can We sill He shivers as though a pain went through
him She holds him closer and begins to sing-without orchestra

MARIA
Hold my hand and were halfway there
Hold my hand and Ill take you there
Someday
Somehow
He has started to join in on the second line She sings harder
as though to urge him back to life but his voice falters and he
barely finishes the line She sings on a phrase or two more
then stops his body quiet in her arms A moment and then as
she gently rests Tony on the floor the orchestra finishes the
last bars of the song Lightly she brushes Tonys lips with her
fingers Behind her Action in font of a group of Jets moves to
lead them toward Chino Maria speaks her voice cold sharp
Stay back The shawl she has had around her shoulders slips to
the ground as she gets up walks to Chino and holds out her hand
He hands her the gun She speaks again in a flat hard voice
How do you fire this gun Chino Just by pulling this little
trigger She points it at him suddenly he draws back She has
all of them in front of her now as she holds the gun out and her
voice gets stronger with anger and savage rage How many bullets
are left Chino Enough for you Pointing at another And you
At Action All of you WE ALL KILLED HIIM and my brother and
Riff I too I CAN KILL NOW BECAUSE I HATE NOW She has been
pointing the gun wildly and they have all been drawing back
Now again she holds it straight out at Action How many can I
kill Chino How many-and still have one bullet left for me
Both hands on the gun she breaks into tears hurls the gun away
and sinks to the ground Schrank walks on looks around and starts
toward Tonys body Like a madwoman Maria races to the body

She kisses him gently Music starts as the two Jets and
two Sharks lift up Tonys body and start to carry him out The
others boys and girls fall in behind to make a procession the
same procession they made in the dream ballet as Baby John comes
forward to pick up Marias shawl and put it over her head She
sits quietly like a woman in mourning as the music builds the
light starts to come up and the procession makes its way across
