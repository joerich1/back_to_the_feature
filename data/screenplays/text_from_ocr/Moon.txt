MOON

An original screenplay by
Nathan Parker

Story by Duncan Jones
Helium3 is a gas ejected from the surface of the sun and
blown through space by solar winds

It plays an essential role in Cold Fusion often toted as
the solution to humanitys future energy needs

There is one major problem

Helium3 is extremely scarce on Earth The gas does
however exist in abundance on the Earths only natural
satellite

The Moon

Should we turn to Cold Fusion in the future it is

conceivable that man will mine the Moon for Helium3 and
bring the precious gas back to Earth

IN THE BLACK
We hear something -- a machine -- CHURNING and POUNDING
Constant Rhythmic Though the sound is slightly familiar
were not sure what it is yet Hold for a few seconds and
then

CUT TO

1 INT REC ROOM -- MORNING
The sound belongs to a regular old TREADMILL like you see
in most gyms across the world Running on it SAM BELL mid
thirties thick beard handsome striking blue eyes
Sam 1’s face is flushed and glistening with sweat He
lunges for a towel draped over the treadmill’s bar dabs
his face as he runs

We see OUTSIDE THE WINDOW A gray powdery landscape
stretching beneath a BLACK SKY

CUT TO

2 EXT MOON -- MORNING

Aerial view of the Earth’s only natural satellite the
camera roaming about a hundred feet off the surface

Desolation Serious uncompromising desolation This place
makes Antarctica look like Tokyo

And utter silence

Eventually the camera arrives at a moon base DIVING DOWN
towards it --

4 INT COMMS NOOK -- MORNING

His hair still wet from the shower Sam 1 sits before a
COMMS UNIT dressed in a “Lunar Industries” boiler suit a
Zip up the front colorful patches sewn into the arms He
begins to record a message

SAM 1
Tess Hi It’s me How are you
sweetheart It’s the morning
here I’m just about to sit down
with Gerty for breakfast go over
the day’s itinerary He sends his
love

As Sam continues his message we are given a TOUR of the
mining base Beginning with

5 INT MONITORING STATION -- CONTINUOUS

This is where you want to be if the shit hits the fan The
base’s equivalent of HQ A wall of computers and flickering
digital displays

SAM 1 (VO)
Everything’s fine up here
Ticking along slowly I found a
bug on one of my plants
yesterday What the hell A bug

6 INT RETURN VEHICLE -- CONTINUOUS

A small space craft attached to the base It is essentially
a tiny room with a coffin like sealed bed in the middle of
it a cryogenic POD with an array of complicated controls
surrounding it

SAM 1 (VO)
Yeah Get’s a little dull up here
sometimes So Two weeks huh
Yay

7 INT REC ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Sam 1 spends most of his time here It is kitchen and play
room combined We PICK OUT a television set an armchair a

SAM 1 (VO) (CONTD)
I get tired faster than I used
to Getting old

DETAIL A WOODEN MODEL

On a table we also PICK OUT a LARGE MODEL carved out of
BALSA WOOD It’s a TOWN Intricately done down to the
tiniest details

SAM (VO)
Not that old Hey Put your
hands over Eve’s ears for a
minute I’m not going to jerk off
for the next 17 days

We go even CLOSER to the model seeing that there are
actual people actual characters in the little town actual
buildings a CHURCH a TOWN HALL etc Clearly someone has
put a ton of work into this thing

SAM 1 (VO)
Watch out I’m gonna get you

8 INT GREENHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 8

And the tour of the base continues Onto a new room A dark
storage area Sam 1 has repurposed to grow a handful of
plants They sit surrounded by darkness glowing under
pools of artificial light

SAM 1 (VO)
Maybe you should take a few days
off work and we drop Eve off with
your brother We can go down to
Apalachacola Shuck some oysters
down on the beach

9 INT INFIRMARY -- CONTINUOUS 9

A strange angular room obviously purposeful but its
design more geared to a computer than a human being A
single bed dominates

SAM 1 (VO)
I’m going to stop now Eve can
probably see that daddy looks
uncomfortable

EXT LUNAR LANDSCAPE -- CONTINUOUS 10

The empty terrain surrounding the mining base as viewed
from the Monitoring Station window Across the landscape a
mountain rises from the morning shadows

SAM 1 (VO)
That and I don’t want to make
Gerty embarrassed

CLOSE UP -- A HAND TOOL

Some kind of rake or shovel half buried in the powdery
soil like a child’s toy abandoned in a sand box

SAM 1 (VO) (CONTD)
You miss daddy baby You want me
to shave this big old beard off
before I get back You still
going to recognize me

EXT EARTH -- AS SEEN FROM THE MOON - CONTINUOUS 11

From up here it is easy to see why the Earth is sometimes
referred to as “the blue marble” A swirl of color

SAM 1 (VO)
I miss both of you sooo much I
can’t believe I’m coming home

INT SLEEPING QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS 12
Sam 1s bed -- A New York Jets poster on the wall -- a few
knickknacks bedside rock samples in jars a lucky
tambourine Sam got in Mexico some years ago -- a red stress

ball -- a photograph by the bed in a frame --

SAM 1 (VO)
I love you

We MOVE CLOSER to the PHOTO by the bed

PHOTOGRAPH

Of a slightly younger and clean-shaven Sam 1 with his arms
wrapped around his wife of four years TESS BELL

Tess is a far cry from the stereotypical Astronaut’s Wife
of the 1960’s70’s with the plastic smile and beehive
hairdo

Liberty Films © 2007 - Version 28 Shooting Script 2 11th Dec 07

Tess is modern sophisticated and jaw-droppingly
beautiful She looks like she’d be a hard woman to leave
behind

Note In the photograph Tess is visibly PREGNANT

INT COMMS NOOK -- CONTINUOUS 13

Back with Sam 1 at the Comms Unit as he wraps up the
message

SAM 1

Eve baby What do you want
daddy to bring you from the moon
huh You want a big shiny rock
Im kidding I love you We’1ll go
to FAO Schwartz and get you the
biggest fluffiest cutest teddy
bear you have ever seen Ok I
gotta go Gerty’s getting
jealous

(kisses hand)
Bye

And he sends the message

CUT TO

INT CORRIDOR -- MORNING LATER 14

The main corridor connecting the different rooms We’ve
seen everything there is to see now The base is small
Confined Claustrophobic It is easy to imagine how someone
could crack up here

Sam 1 leaves the Comms Room and heads down the corridor

INT REC ROOM -- MORNING 15
A state of the art robot a GERTY 3000 -- known simply as
“GERTY” -- is preparing Sams breakfast

Gerty is in three sections and moves along a horizontal
rail that runs throughout the base He has a readout screen
that perpetually spews data His hands resemble pincers
but are perfectly nimble

For the purposes of helping run the base and looking after
Sam 1 Gerty is as good as human if not better

Sam 1 enters
Liberty Films © 2007 - Version 28 Shooting Script 2 11th Dec 07

SAM 1
Two weeks

GERTY
Morning Sam How are you today

Sam 1 grins

SAM 1
Hey you want to give me a
haircut later

GERTY
Of course How’s your headache

SAM 1
Much better thanks pal Yeah
Good A hair cut I think I’m
going to shave too What do you
think Gerty Think it’s time to
get rid of this

Sam 1 feels at his chin He treats Gerty more like a
person than a robot Whether this is down to Gerty’s
intelligence or Sam 1s desperation for company isn’t clear
just yet

Note Gerty talks like a well-educated older man His
language doesn’t have a great deal of inflection (ie
Monotone) but he is friendly enough

Sam 1 switches a dial on a radio but gets nothing but
static -- he sticks in a mini cd and skips the first few
tracks We hear brief clips of talk radio and shuttle
through it before he allows it to play on on some random
American station -- an old weather report

VOICE ON RADIO
-it’s a hot one on the East
Coast temperatures soaring to a
high of ninety three degrees in
New York City --

They zip around the tiny kitchen together preparing Sams
breakfast working as a team

The second in a fleet of four Harvesters (this one known as
Mark) collecting lunar soil The Harvester resembles a tank
and kicks up clouds of dust Booming hulking efficient

Sam 1 catches up in his Rover and accelerates into the back
of the Harvester up a couple of ramps An intricate and
dangerous maneuver he executes deftly

INT HARVESTERBELLY -- CONTINUOUS 24

Sam 1 is in an area of the Harvester -- a kind of hatch --
not dissimilar to a garage and known as THE BELLY Once
safely inside Sam 1 closes the door He is able to breathe
in the Belly without his helmet which he duly removes

Sam 1 steps up to a wall of computers A light is flashing
to indicate one of the pods is filled with Helium3

Sam 1 does his thing eventually removing a keg-size pod of
Helium3 He hauls it over to the Rover and sticks it ina
special slot in the equivalent of the Rover’s trunk

A new pod -- an empty -- replaces the pod Sam 1 just
removed

Sam 1 puts his helmet back on returns to the Rover
reverses out of the Harvester carefully

Oh really That’s terrible
That’s what happens when you

Just don’t let Rex lick you there
anymore Don’t worry I’m not
crazy

(back to work)
I’ve got a full container of
Helium3 ready to roll The purity
is pretty good so assuming your
last market prices are still
relevant I think you are looking
at getting about 3 million
dollars per kilo with this load
By the time this message reaches
you it should be in transit

Otherwise everything running
smoothly There was a discrepancy
between a couple of Mark’s
thermostats a couple of days ago
but Gerty and I caught it in
time no big deal Uhhow are
things down there

Sam 1 desperately wants to talk but has nothing very
important to say Then he remembers something

SAM 1 (CONT’D)

Oh and I just wanted to thank
you for sending out the football

(getting pissed off)
Seriously I don’t mean to be an
asshole but surely replacing one
satellite cant be that fucking
hard I haven’t been able to
have a conversation with my
wife My kid can talk now

All of a sudden Sam 1 STOPS He has the feeling someone is
standing behind him He slowly turns

A GIRL is standing in the doorway watching him She is
perhaps fifteen or sixteen years old A yellow dress Long
wheat-colored hair Freckles At once beautiful and
haunting

Sam 1 gets the FRIGHT of his life He FLIES against the

There is a loud clicking and the lights briefly dim The
Cargo Container is fired into space with a TERRIFIC
CRACKING noise It distracts Sam 1’s attention breaks his
stare

And just like that the Girl is gone Sam 1 is just staring
at an empty doorway Nothing there

Sam 1 is baffled Had to be his imagination Had to be

continues working

Sam stares at himself in a handheld mirror Gerty is
cutting Sam 1’s hair

Sam 1 sitting back in a chair thinking about trimming his
beard with a pair of scissors Gerty skims his hair with
an electric clipper

GERTY
Sam is everything okay

SAM 1
Everything’s fine Gerty

For a moment there is no sound but the snipping of scissors
and buzzing of clippers Then

SAM 1 (CONT’D)
Why do you ask

GERTY
You don’t seem like yourself
today
Sam 1 frowns contemplative For a moment we think he is
going to tell Gerty about the Girl he saw earlier -- or
imagined he saw But he holds off

GERTY (CONT’D)
Has something happened

SAM 1
No not exactly

Gerty stops cutting lowers the scissors

GERTY
Sam what is it

Sam 1 goes with something different

Tess is distant Sam

Sam 1 shrugs

SAM 1
I mean she isn’t responding to

GERTY
What kind of things

SAM 1

(a beat)
You know Vacation stuff I was
thinking of Mexico or Hawaii
Giving her all sorts of ideas
Things we could do when I get
back Tess never said anything
about it Three messages she’s
sent me sinceand she’s never
once mentioned the vacation

GERTY
I’m sure she can’t wait Sam

SAM 1
That’s not the point This is
someone who lives for vacations
and travelling I thought she’d

be crazy about going -- with Eve
of course -- we’d take Eve

GERTY
Perhaps Tess didn’t receive the
message

This isn’t the only time it’s
happened Gerty

GERTY
Christopher Her brother I
believe he did get tenure

SAM 1

GERTY
Yes Professor of Biochemistry
at Syracuse University in New
York

Sam 1 is slightly alarmed that Gerty knows this and he
doesn’t

SAM 1
How do you know that

GERTY
You told me Some time ago now
(a beat)
You were very happy for your
brother-in-law You danced around
the Rec Room

Sam 1 looks perturbed For a few seconds he’d eased up on
the stress ball He starts up on it again now

SAM 1
Gerty have you heard anything
new about anyone fixing lunar
sat

GERTY
No Sam From what I understand
it’s fairly low on the companies
priority list right now with the
Jupiter mission active I would
imagine it’s going to be very
expensive to fix

A pause Sam 1 still looks troubled

GERTY (CONT’D)
Sam are you ok
Liberty Films © 2007 - Version 28 Shooting Script 2 11th Dec 07

SAM 1
They need to sort that out
Seriously I’ve only got two
weeks left but it’s not fair on
whoever’s up here next Gerty
you tell them to sort it out
It’s not healthy

GERTY
I will Sam Do you want me to
finish cutting your hair later

SAM 1
Nah Come on Let’s finish
this

Gerty resumes cutting Sam 1’s hair and stops again
sensing Sam 1 is going to say something more

The clippers freeze

SAM 1 (CONT’D)

headaches Can you get me
something for it

GERTY
Of course Now

SAM 1
No not now afterwards

superiors OVERMEYERS and THOMPSON a purposeful looking
man in charge and his earnest second

The two talk RAPIDLY and trade off like a tag team At
times their tone can be almost bizarrely whimsical

Overmeyers and Thompson seem to have known Sam for a while
but even so there is a practised casualness to the
repartee It’s no more than a professional friendliness on
Overmeyers part but for Thompson there’s an eagerness to
be involved

OVERMEYERS
Delighted to hear about the
latest shipment Sam

THOMPSON
According to Albatross 90 it
should be landing off the
California Coast within the next
three days

OVERMEYERS
Now in response to your question
about the communications
equipment the news is not good

Sam those solar storms did a lot
more damage than initially
thought --

OVERMEYERS
Fixing the lunar sat is going to
take some time It’s a
significant operation

THOMPSON
And what with the Jupiter Program
hemorrhaging money --

Sam 1 curses to himself

OVERMEYERS
Lunar doesn’t have the budget it
once did Sam you know that

THOMPSON
Even the coffee machine down in
the Hub has been broken since I
don’t know when --

OVERMEYERS
We have to go to Genesis 3 just
to get a decent cup of coffee

the room Bewitched play on TV

Note Whenever any TV is watched in the film it is always
a show from 1970s America (Mash Six Million Dollar Man
Laugh-In etc) No explanation is given for this

Sam 1 is half-watching the TV but his focus is chiefly on
the SMALL HOUSE he is carving And carving beautifully

After a few seconds he stands and snaps off the TV with a
remote He crosses to the kitchen section of the Rec Room
to make some tea The water has just boiled

As Sam 1 is about to pour the boiling water tea kettle in
hand he glances across the Rec Room and sees

The Girl She’s taken Sam’s chair before the model She is
motionless staring down at the model like she recognizes
one of the little figures walking the tiny streets

Sam 1 calmly puts the tea kettle down and begins to move
towards the Girl slowly cautiously like he wants to
sneak up on her

Sam 1 walks right up to the Girl and reaches out his
hand

look into Luke

But bizarrely the Sam talking on the monitor has long hair
pulled back into a ponytail

And then another BLIP -- another BLAST of STATIC -- and
the screen turns completely BLACK

A single word begins to flash in the center of the screen
“ERROR ”

The word flashes three times -- before the screen returns
to normal the CLOCK running again

It all happened so quickly Sam 1 wonders if he didn’t just
imagine it After an awkward pause he simply continues the

As Sam gets closer to the Harvester he suddenly sees
something

The Girl

She is standing maybe a hundred yards away in her yellow
dress resembling a FLAME or a FLOWER in the barren and
colorless landscape She appears to be staring directly at
Sam 1’s rover

SAM 1

His face unfolding with panic alarm curiosity An
intense yearning curiosity

He drives closer

But like in a dream Sam can’t seem to make up any distance
between the Rover and the Girl He CRUSHES the accelerator
pedal

For a moment Sam drives right alongside the Harvester
clouds of lunar dust being kicked up cascading against the
side window But Sam is looking away from the Harvester
focussed on the Girl

ON SAM 1 He doesn’t notice Matthew (The Harvester)
suddenly veer RIGHT slamming into the side of the Rover
and causing Sam to lose control

The steering wheel swings left and right as Sam desperately
tries to STRAIGHTEN the path of the vehicle but a split
second later the Rover is FLIPPED like a matchbox and
caught up in the tracks of the Harvester -- a HIDEOUS
SCREECH of MANGLED METAL

The Rover is JAMMED under the Harvester’s monstrous TREADS
resembling a crushed beer can in a fist -- and with a BIG
BOOMING GROAN the Harvester slides to a STANDSTILL

caught beneath it

Sam 2 looks bewildered -- he desperately racks his brain
trying to locate the memory

Do you remember what happened

SAM 2
No

I don’t remember a thing

Sam 2 just stares back at Gerty not so much as a flicker
of recognition

GERTY
Do you remember me

SAM 2
Yes of course I remember you

GERTY

That’s good That’s very good

It’s nice to see you awake again

and pokes his head out into the corridor

As he walks up the corridor in the direction of the Comms

peers over

Gerty is giving Sam something very similar to an IQ Test
Sam 2 has just arranged a series of blocks into an L-shaped
tower

GERTY
Excellent Sam

SAM 2
How much longer do I have to be
in here Gerty

GERTY
Sam you may have suffered some
brain damage in the crash This
would explain your memory loss
and slight logic impairment

SAM 2
What’s the diagnosis When can I
get back to work

GERTY
Central has asked me to slow down
the Harvesters to ensure you have
time to recuperate and get your
strength back --

SAM 2
(dryly exasperated)
Terrific
GERTY

You can return to the sleeping

quarters tomorrow But it will

still be a few more days before
you can resume anything like a

normal work schedule

himself with his own belongings

His eyes arrive on the red stress ball Sam scoops up the

her belly as much as possible There’s definitely
something wrong

CAUTION He parks a few feet away from the wreck and opens
the door of his Rover stepping outside gingerly

ONE SIXTH GRAVITY is like walking on a trampoline Sam
takes long strides bobbing over to the front of the

FOOTPRINTS in the lunar soil

The crashed Rover is exactly as we left it after the
accident mangled crushed captured beneath the trundles
of the Harvester Sam 2 peers closer and sees that there is
an UNCONSCIOUS MAN in a Lunar Industries space suit trapped
inside

Sam 2 can’t see the man’s face -- he has his back to Sam 2
his body sprawled across the passenger seat like he’s
searching for loose change on the floor of the vehicle

With great effort Sam 2 manages to prize the Rover’s door
open He reaches inside and begins to pull the man out --

He BRUSHES DUST from the glass of the man’s HELMET leans

happy to see you again

As he says this Sam 2 crosses slowly from one side of the

90 INT REC ROOM -- LATER
After the game the two Sams are sprawled in their seats

sweaty flushed energized Sam 1 sits before the model of
the town Sam 2 loitering behind him

SAM 2
How long did it take you to do
this

SAM 1

I don’t remember doing all of it
I remember when I did the church
and the Salvation Army And a few
of the people My mind’s been
acting kind of weird lately
though

SAM 2
It’s Fairfield right
(pointing)
There’s Town Hall

SAM 1
Uh-huh You know Fairfield
(also pointing)
That’s my house And there’s Tess
and Eve Do you know Tess

The mention of their wife has stopped the conversation in
its tracks Sam 2 immediately drops into deep melancholy

SAM 2
Yes I know Tess This is your
house It’s nice

SAM 1
Yeah We needed it for the
family You know about Eve
right

It is obvious from Sam 2s expression that he doesn’t

SAM 1 (CONT’D)

SAM 2
How much did she weigh Isn’t

SAM 1
Nine pounds eleven ounces

Sam 2 doesn’t know what to do with the news on the one
hand he is jubilant on the other he’s a clone the baby
technically isn’t even his

All of a sudden there is a “PING” From the Intercom
speaker

GERTY’S VOICE
Sam a message has arrived from
Central

Sam 1 SPRINGS from his chair Sam 2 follows behind

and hang in there
Liberty Films © 2007 - Version 28 Shooting Script 2 11th Dec 07

OVERMEYERS
Yeah you hang in there Sam Over
and out

And the screen pops to black A pause

For a moment there is silence neither of the Sams knowing
how to react -- going by the message Thompson and
Overmeyers don’t know anything about there being two Sams
on the base now

SAM 1
They’re sending a Rescue Unit
Why

SAM 2

To fix the stalled harvester
They didn’t think I was up to it

SAM 1
Then I’m going back

Sam 2 gives Sam 1 a perplexed look
SAM 1 (CONT’D)
I’ve done my three years That’s
it for me --

Sam 2 is shaking his head slowly

SAM 1 (CONTD)
What

SAM 2
Is that what you really think

SAM 1
I’ve got a contract --

SAM 2
You’re a fucking clone You don’t
have shit

At once Sam 1 and Sam 2 ROCKET to their feet -- right in
each others faces on the BRINK of BLOWS

SAM 1
I’m going home

SAM 2
Youre not going anywhere

Sam 1 turns around heads out of the room Sam 2 STORMS
after him TALKING the whole time --
Liberty Films © 2007 - Version 28 Shooting Script 2 11th Dec 07

SAM 2 (CONTD)
Youve been up here too long

Gerty shuttles along after the two Sams

92 INT CORRIDOR -- NIGHT CONTINUOUS

Sam 1 presses down the corridor towards the sleeping
quarters Sam 2 tailing right behind him

SAM 2
What you think Tess is back home
waiting for you What about the
original Sam

SAM 1
I’m the original I’m Sam
fucking Bell Me Me

Sam 1 stress ball pumping away in his hand spots Gerty
and angrily faces him

SAM 1 (CONT’D)
Gerty am I a clone

Gerty doesn’t know which way to look

GERTY
Yes Sam

Sam 1 goes weak He needs to get away He heads in the
opposite direction to where he was going staggering into
the Rec Room Sam 2 in tow

93 INT REC ROOM -- NIGHT CONTINUOUS

Sam 1 takes his old seat before the model Sam 2 stands
over him

SAM 2
What about the other clones

“Other clones” Sam 1 just stares back

SAM 2 (CONTD)
Yeah we might not be the first
two to be woken up
(indicating the model)
You said that thing had already
been started when you got here
Well who started it
(then)
(MORE )
Liberty Films © 2007 - Version 28 Shooting Script 2 11th Dec 07
SAM 2 (CONTD)

There might be other clones up

here right now Think about it

How did I get here so quickly

after your crash They didn’t

ship me in from Central there

wasn’t time I must have come

from the base

SAM 1
That’s ridiculous Impossible
Why would they do that

SAM 2
I bet there’s some kind of secret
room —-
SAM 1
(laughing)

Secret room

SAM 2
Yeah secret room why not

SAM 1

(losing his cool)
You’re the one who’s lost your
mind I’ve been here for three
years I know every inch of this
base I know how many dust fibres
are between those wall panels
over there -- why would they do
that

SAM 2

Look It’s a company right
They have investors shareholders
-- shit like that What’s
cheaper Spending time and money
training new personnel or just
have a couple of spares here to
do the job It’s the far side of
the Moon Sam The tight fuck’s
haven’t even fixed our
communications satellite

SAM 1
Tess would know
Liberty Films © 2007 - Version 28 Shooting Script 2 11th Dec 07

SAM 2
Do you really think they give a
shit about us They’re laughing
all the way to the bank

SAM 1
Tess would know what’s going on
She wouldn’t let that happen
SAM 2
(exhasperated)
There’s some area we don’t know
about I’m going to find it

Sam 1 shakes his head dismissively picks up the wooden
house starts whittling

Meanwhile Sam 2 has left the room

INT MONITORING STATION -- QUICK CUTS

Sam 2 in the Monitoring Station checking wall panels
reaching his hand inside cubbies and feeling around deep

Sam 1 half-whittling half-watching

SAM 1

SAM 2
Shut-up

Finally Sam 2 arrives before the model

Liberty Films © 2007 - Version 28 Shooting Script 2 11th Dec 07

SAM 2 (CONTD)
Get out of the way

SAM 1
Why

SAM 2
I want to check underneath there

SAM 1
You’re not moving the model

SAM 2
Get the fuck out of my way

Sam 1 stands keeps his ground

SAM 1
No

Sam 1 is still holding the knife Though he’s not about to
use it both Sams are aware that it’s there

Suddenly Sam 2 LUNGES for the knife an INTENSE STRUGGLE
ensues -- TEETH CLENCHED sputtering BREATHS -- the two
Sams less people right now than ANIMALS

Sam 2 is able to loosen Sam 1’s grip on the knife --
flinging the weapon across the room -- and SWINGS Sam 1 up
against the wall

Now Sam 2 turns to face the model Using BOTH HANDS he
lifts the model up HIGH over his HEAD and PUSHES the entire
thing UPSIDE DOWN A massive CRASH

There is nothing there but the bare table

Sam 1 comes up behind Sam 2 with his nose SPEWING BLOOD
wraps both arms around Sam 2’s neck Sam 2 elbows him in
the ribs -- a quick controlled jab -- SPINS around
Manages to secure Sam 1 in an arm lock

But suddenly there is no struggle coming from Sam 1 he’s
stopped fighting Sam 2 removes him from the headlock --
notices his arm is SMUDGED with Sam 1’s BLOOD --

SAM 2
You okay

Sam 1 has remained bent over like he’s cast in stone
blood RAINING from his face and POOLING at his feet thick
and fast

Sam 2 just staring as freaked as he is baffled
Liberty Films © 2007 - Version 28 Shooting Script 2 11th Dec 07

SAM 2 (CONTD)
I hardly touched you

Now he tries to help Sam 1

SAM 2 (CONT’D)
Let me see

Sam 1 tears away from him He looks up his face a MESS of
blood -- the WHITES of his eyes unnaturally bright shouts

SAM 1
Get off me

Sam 1 holds his face with his outstretched hand as if
holding it in place -- STUMBLES from the room -- leaking
BLOOD the whole way

A concerned Sam 2 watches him go

CUT TO

INT SLEEPING QUARTERS -- MOMENTS LATER 98

Sam 1 spills in He RAPIDLY turns on the faucet and cups
his hand to transfer water up to his face -- this going on
for a few seconds

MIRROR

Sam 1 stares at his reflection in the mirror holding a
MOUND of TOILET PAPER against his NOSE The blood flow has
subsided

Suddenly Sam 1 sees the GIRL in the mirror It gives him a
hell of a FRIGHT

The Girl remains in the mirror looking at Sam 1 A neutral
expression impassive Sam 1 takes a deep breath lowers
the toilet paper from his nose

SAM 1
Who are you

No answer
SAM 1 (CONT’D)

(shouting)
Who are you
Liberty Films © 2007 - Version 28 Shooting Script 2 11th Dec 07

Sam 1 swings around to confront the Girlbut she’s not
there she’s vanished Her reflection has vanished from the
mirror also

GERTY
Hello Sam

SAM 1
Hi Gerty

Sam 1 sits A pause Gerty turns from the monitor faces
off with an EXHAUSTED and DRAINED Sam 1

GERTY
Sam is everything okay

SAM 1

that thing

GERTY
938 hours

SAM 1
938 hours exactly
(then)
Really 938 hours

GERTY
Approximately

SAM 1
(a beat)
He scares me Gerty
Liberty Films © 2007 - Version 28 Shooting Script 2 11th

A beat

A pause

GERTY
What is it about Sam that scares
you

SAM 1

He flies off the handle I see it
nowI see what Tess was talking
about

(a beat)
I’ve never told you this Gerty
but she left me Tess left me
For six months She moved back in
with her parents

GERTY
I know

SAM 1
Oh
(beat)
It was a couple of months before
I came in here She gave me a
second chance I promised her I’d
change

GERTY
You have changed Sam

SAM 1
Yeah I guess I have

SAM 1 (CONT’D)
Gerty since I’ve been up here
I’ve sent Tess over a hundred
video messages Where did those
messages go Did they ever reach
her

GERTY
Sam I can only account for what
occurs on the base

SAM 1
What about the messages she sent
to me

A long pause Finally Gerty repeats

GERTY
Sam I can only account for what
occurs on the base

Dec 07
Liberty Films © 2007 - Version 28 Shooting Script 2 11th Dec 07

SAM 1
Gerty am I really a clone

GERTY
Sam when you first arrived at
Sarang there was a small crash
You woke up in the infirmary You
suffered minor brain damage and
memory loss I kept you under
observation and ran some tests

SAM 1
I remember

GERTY

Sam there was no crash You
were being awakened

(a beat)
It is standard procedure for all
new clones to be given tests to
establish mental stability and
general physical health Genetic
abnormalities and minor
duplication errors in the DNA can
have considerable impact--

SAM 1
And Tess Eve

GERTY
They are memory implants Sam
Uploaded edited memories of the
original Sam Bell I’m very
sorry

Sam 1 nods at this He’s broken-hearted He begins to

leave
GERTY (CONT’D)
Sam it’s been several hours
since your last meal Can I
prepare you something

SAM 1
No thanks Gerty

Sam 1 exits

INT SLEEPING QUARTERS -- NIGHT LATER

INT REC ROOM -- NIGHT LATER 102

The TV is off Sam 2 is sitting arms folded entrenched in
GLOOM in a large puffy SELK SUIT A wearable sleeping bag
with arms and legs

Sam 1 enters and heads for the kitchen prepares himself a
snack Sam 2 is aware that Sam 1 is there but keeps his
eyes focussed forward as immobile as a statue

Eventually Sam 1 tentatively comes over

SAM 1
You okay

SAM 2
I’m staring into space
(points to the window)
Get it

Sam 1 does get it He smiles to be polite sits

SAM 2 (CONTD)
Thanks for this It’s pretty
good Cosy How’s the nose

SAM 1
Better

A beat

SAM 2
Listen I went haywire before I
lost it I’m sorry

SAM 1
It’s okay

SAM 2
No it’s not okay I fucked up
Fairfield -- your model I don’t
know what’s wrong with me
(then)
I’ve got a temper I need to do
something about it

SAM 1
Yes you do

A pause
Liberty Films © 2007 - Version 28 Shooting Script 2 11th Dec 07

SAM 2
I wasn’t supposed to find you
Sam Lunar instructed Gerty to
keep me locked inside the base
while you were out there

A pause Sam 1 thinking it over

SAM 2 (CONTD)
There’s something else
(a beat)
Right around the time I was
awakenedI walked in on Gerty
talking to Central He was having
a live conversation

SAM 1
A live conversation

Sam 2 feels himself losing his temper a little here He
reigns himself in

SAM 1 (CONT’D)
How do you know the conversation
was live
Liberty Films © 2007 - Version 28 Shooting Script 2 11th Dec 07

SAM 1 (CONT’D)

The communications equipment is
damaged -- there was a solar
storm --

SAM 2
It was live man

SAM 1
Yeah there was a flare It
fried the satellite

SAM 2
It was live They don’t want us
to be able to contact Earth They
lied to us They’ve been lying to
us sincewell they’ve always
been lying to us

A pause Sam 1 staring forward concentrating Sam 2
concentrating on Sam 1

SAM 1
If the satellite works how are
they blocking the live feed down
here Everything works fine --

SAM 2
Maybe they’re not blocking the
signal from inside the base

SAM 1
From where then

As if reading each others minds the two Sams’ heads turn
to the window -- a slow perfectly synchronized movement

The lunar landscape as black and vast as ever The view
almost cruel in its emptiness It’s not giving them any
answers not yet

IE ROVER TWOMOON SURFACE -- DAY 103

Sam 1 speeding along in one of the Rovers He wears his
space suit and resembles a cosmic racing driver -- shifts
up a gear the vehicle flirting with peak speed

He flies past one of the Harvesters speaks through a
microphone inside his helmet

SAM 1
Just passing the last of the
Harvesters -- looks like John --

All of this against the ROAR of the Rover’s engine

IE ROVER THREEMOON SURFACE -- DAY CONTINUOUS 104
Driving away from base in a different direction Sam 2 He
also wears a space suit He also guns the engine He also
has a microphone inside his helmet The two clones are able
to talk back and forth with no delay
SAM 2

How long until you’re out of the

base’s range
We INTERCUT between the two Sams in their Rovers

SAM 1
A minute Ninety seconds tops

SAM 2
You ever been this far out

SAM 1
No never
ANOTHER ANGLE -- SECOND ROVER
Viewed from far away the Rover’s speed less impressive
from a distance
IE ROVER’S TWO AND THREEMOON SURFACE -- INTERCUT 105
As the Sams continue to drive

SAM 2
I haven’t seen anything yet You
Liberty Films © 2007 - Version 28 Shooting Script 2 11th Dec 07

SAM 1
It would help if I knew what I
was looking for

Through the glass of Sam 1’s helmet we see his FACE
suddenly SHIFT

SAM 1 (CONTD)
Wait a second wait a second

Sam 1 squints and leans closer towards the windshield like
he’s trying to decipher a road sign --

SAM 1 (CONT’D)
I see something
SAM 1S POV

About a hundred feet away -- appearing from thin air -- a
massive metal pole stretches up into the black sky

Sam 1 getting closer

Sam 1 stops his Rover about twenty feet from the Jammer He
opens the Rover’s hatch and climbs out to take a closer
look

WIDE SHOT -- SAM 1ROVER

Taking in the Jammer and the adjacent Rover Sam 1 loping
towards the Jammer seemingly in slow motion
Liberty Films © 2007 - Version 28 Shooting Script 2 11th Dec 07

The JAMMER is GIGANTIC --An intimidating stark pole
stabbed into the lunar landscape like the worlds biggest
caber Next to it Sam 1 is tiny a white dot as
insignificant as a pin prick

Sam 2s rover is approaching something similar

SAM 2 (0S)
Jesus I’ve found something
That’s a big fucker Looks like
a a pylon or antennae or

something
Sam 2 ENERGIZED -- they are excited to have made this
discovery -- not dealing with the negatives yet

SAM 2 (CONTD)
Dude its a jammer
(looking around)
I knew it No wonder we can’t get
a live feed

Suddenly Sam 1 doubles over He vomits thick viscous
blood and sick into his helmet Revolting

The noise is AUDIBLE over the microphone

SAM 2 (CONTD)
You okay

No answer from Sam 1 He COLLAPSES onto his knees His
chest LURCHES like he’s been punched at from the inside --
he spins over onto his front --

SAM 2 (CONT’D)
Sam Sam

Sam 1 manages to climb to his feet -- heads slowly back to
the Rover -- he dips in closes the door

SAM 2 (CONTD)
(panicked)
Sam can you hear me

HF

Liberty Films © 2007 - Version 28 Shooting Script 2 11th Dec 07

SAM 1
Yeah I hear you
(then)
I’m going to head back to base
I’m not feeling too good

SAM 2
I’m going to stay out here a
little longer I want to see if
there are any more of these
things

CUT TO

IE SAM 1’S ROVERMOON SURFACE -- DAY CONTINUOUS 106

Sam 1 at the wheel He switches off his mic He has pulled

his helmet off within the safe pocket of the rovers cabin

He’s a grizzly mess of splashed sick and blood all over his
face and chest

Sam 1 screams out with confusion frustration terror

SAM 1
Fuck

He seizes the steering wheel shakes it FIERCELY --
beginning to really LOSE IT --

INT DOCK -- DAY LATER 107
Sam 1 drives his Rover into the Dock -- not with his
customary precision -- parks at an angle grazes the wall

The Rover’s door JERKS opens and Sam 1 steps out
unsteadily his face visibly PALE through the glass of his
helmet

He STAGGERS across the dock -- doesn’t even close the
Rover’s door behind him -- heads into the corridor
INT CORRIDOR -- DAY CONTINUOUS 108

Sam 1 goes staggering across the corridor like a drunkard --
BANGING into walls -- he finally reaches the bathroom and
ducks in --
Liberty Films © 2007 - Version 28 Shooting Script 2 11th Dec 07

INT SLEEPING QUARTERS -- DAY CONTINUOUS 109

Sam 1 sinks to his knees before the toilet bowl With great
effort he is able to remove his helmet placing it on the
floor next to him He stares into the toilet

For a moment all is calm The gentle “ping-ping-ping” of a
computer somewhere inside the base Sam breathing steadily
Spots of sweat on his upper lip

And then he VOMITS He vomits LOUD he vomits VIOLENTLY
His whole body THRUSTS forward in the process taught
tense like a dog being YANKED on a CHAIN

Sam 1 vomits again And again And again And stops

ANGLE FROM ABOVE -- SAM 1
Sam 1s vomit is DARK RED -- he’s thrown up BLOOD -- but
that’s not all -- we can clearly see two or three TEETH

floating in the vomit --

THE MIRROR

Sam 1 stands moves to the mirror opening his mouth wide

to look for the missing teeth -- he uses his thumbs shows
his gums -- revealing yes he’s lost at least a couple of
teeth

He flushes the toilet

CUT TO

EXT MOON -- DAY 110
Sam 2 driving along in his Rover He comes across another
one of these JAMMERS He drives right up ducks down
peering up through the windshield -- this new Jammer is as
tall as the others in fact it is identical in every way
How many of these things are there

Sam 2 circles the Jammer in the Rover drives on

CUT TO

INT MONITORING STATION -- DAY 111

Sam 1 enters and sits down at The Old Man Frantically he
starts typing in numbers
Liberty Films © 2007 - Version 28 Shooting Script 2 11th Dec 07

An array of Log Entries appear ON THE SCREEN Sam watches
one of them

SAM 1
(on screen)
January 12th Lunar hour 832
All Harvesters running smoothly
today Readouts are as follows
Matthew 127 miles Mark 119
miles

These are just his log entries What’s he looking for

Sam 1 starts scrolling BACK through the log entries like
he’s REWINDING chapters on a DVD showing himself at
various stages of his time on Sarang -- his beard
essentially growing in REVERSE as the messages stretch
further back -- eventually Sam 1 is clean shaven --

SAM 1 (CONT’D)
(on the screen)

Luke 129 miles John 111

miles
Sam 1 keeps typing in numbers
ON THE SCREEN “RESTRICTED PASSWORD REQUIRED”
No go He tries to hack his way in but is having no luck
One of Gerty’s long spindly ARMS slides into the room Sam
backs away from the intimidating piece of machinery but it

stops within reach of the computer

Sam 1 watches as the arm reaches forward and taps the
password in for him It leaves the room the way it came

in

Sam 1 continues to go further and further back -- and
suddenly he POPS up on the screen again -- or is it him --
this Sam up on the screen has stubble -- no beard -- and

looks seriously ILL --
He is barely able to talk -- in fact he’s SLURRING --

SAM

»dohn 151 milessorry I’m
not feeling too hot today -- I’m
going to have to continue this
later --
Liberty Films © 2007 - Version 28 Shooting Script 2 11th Dec 07

The SEQUENCE becomes a FAST-PACED and NIGHTMARISH MONTAGE --
continuing to BACKTRACK through the log entries -- showing
yet more SAMS -- one has a MOUSTACHE -- one has grown out
his hair and has a PONY TAIL we’ve seen this particular

Sam before in an earlier scene

But all the Sams have one thing in common towards the
latter end of their log entries they all appear to be in
very bad physical shape --

SAM 4
--Ll’ve got blood coming out of
my nose

SAM 5

I don’t feel too well Old Man

SAM 6
My hair’s falling outlook it

Sam 1 searches even DEEPER into the COMPUTER and uncovers
yet more footage

We see the others Sams returning to Earth -- yet they don’t
seem to go anywhere -- when they blast off the RETURN
VEHICLE remains in its bay --

Sam 1 views different Sams blasting back to earth in the
return vehicle -- always with the same result -- the return
vehicle remaining in its bay the Sams seemingly VANISHING

In one particularly GRAINY SEQUENCE Sam 1 views Gerty
opening the lid to the cryo pod in the return vehicle and
beginning to VACUUM what appears to be DUST or DEBRIS --

Sam 1 understands now that the Return Vehicle is not a
spacecraft but some kind of INCINERATOR

INT RETURN VEHICLE -- DAY LATER 112

Sam 1 heads into the Return Vehicle Its dominated by the
cryo pod used to hold astronauts in a state of cryogenic
sleep on their way back to Earth Sam 1 pops open the lid
and starts frantically searching the chamber for TRACES of
the previous Sams eventually finding particles of DUST in
the cracks --

He closes the lid A video showing a TECHNICIAN in a white
lab coat begins to play on a screen aimed at the glass lid

of the pod It’s mute but we can hear a tinny version of

the audio coming from the cryo pod Sam 1 pushes a button

on the monitor and we hear the audio properly
Liberty Films © 2007 - Version 28 Shooting Script 2 11th Dec 07

TECHNICIAN
and please check to insure you
have removed all jewelry before
entering the cryo pod Lay down
relax and breathe deeply The
cryo pod is designed to put you
into a deep sleep for the
duration of your three day return
journey back to Earth As you
begin to get sleepy think about
the magnificent job youve done
and how proud your family are of
what you’ve accomplished And
thank you Lunar Industries
remains the number one provider
of clean energy world-wide due
to the hard work of people like
you

Relaxing music begins to play After a moment the music
stops There is a pause Then an almighty pulse of light
from the cryo pod This is how Sams past have met their
end Nuked to ash like microwave meals in the cryo pod

Sam 1 inspects the controls of the spacecraft to see if it
really is a vehicle -- in the process of his search he
finds himself down on his knees checking out the wiring

Suddenly Sam 1’s attention is on the floor BENEATH HIM He

appears to be kneeling on some kind of PANEL -- like a
tablet in the return vehicle’s floor -- he presses his ear
against the panel -- KNOCKS --

The panel sounds HOLLOW

AIR LOCK

Sam 1 opens a cubby swipes something similar to a CROW
BAR heads out of the frame --

RETURN VEHICLE

Back in the Return Vehicle Sam 1 stands over the panel in
the floor He uses the CROW BAR to prize the panel open --

his clone’s poor parking job

Sam 2 exits the Parking Bay and removes his helmet Down
the corridor he sees Sam 1 standing outside the Return
Vehicle facing him waiting

SAM 2
I saw three more of those
jammers The base is surrounded
I printed out their coordinates --

Sam 2 begins to remove a piece of paper from his pocket
but suddenly stops He can tell by Sam 1’s expression that
something has happened

SAM 1
I found your secret room

INT RETURN VEHICLE -- DAY 115

Standing over the Open Panel an anxious Sam 1 and Sam 2
stare down

SAM 2
Who goes first

Sam 1 wordlessly takes the lead crouching slightly to
seize the ladder and twist his body down into the hole He
begins to DESCEND When he is roughly half way down Sam 2
follows

INT LOWER DECKCHAMBER -- CONTINUOUS 116

Sam 1 reaches the bottom of the ladder He’s in a dark
room a kind of CHAMBER -- if NASA did crypts it would
look like this

The only light source right now is the coming from the
Return Vehicle up above Sam 2 hops down beside Sam 1
squints into the darkness
Liberty Films © 2007 - Version 28 Shooting Script 2 11th Dec 07

The two Sams can hardly believe their eyes stretching back
maybe one hundred feet are rows and rows of NUMBERED
DRAWERS -- like an epic morgue -- and on the other side of
the room directly facing the drawers an equally epic line
of fridges full of food

Spooky as hell

For a few moments Sam 1 and 2 are too stunned to speak
They stare down the length of the chamber It must be as
long as the base itself

Sam 2 opens a drawer beside them The clone inside is bare
chested He appears to be wearing a HOSPITAL GOWN
identical to the ones they wore in the infirmary

Sam 1 MARVELS at how the clone is identical to himself in
every way down to the minutest of details -- same hair
same skin tone same fingernails -- a few of the drawers
have different colored lights on next to them Empty
drawers Sams’ who have been and gone

SAM 2
Why are there so many of them

Liberty Films © 2007 - Version 28 Shooting Script 2 11th Dec 07

SAM 2 (CONTD)

Sam 1 doesn’t respond he’s in his own world

All of a sudden Sam 1 makes a beeline for the ladder
starts heading back up

SAM 2 (CONTD)
Where are you going Why are
there so many of them

117 INT MONITORING STATION -- MOMENTS LATER 117
Sam 1 is digging around removing bits of equipment some
wires a radio a small machine called a VIDEO PHONE
referred to as a VP

As he climbs down the ladder from the monitor room he is
surprised by Gerty
Liberty Films © 2007 - Version 28 Shooting Script 2 11th Dec 07

GERTY
Sam can I help you with
something

SAM 1
Not now Gerty okay

Gerty settles into his station Sam turns to him
SAM 1 (CONT’D)
Gerty Why did you help me With
the password Doesn’t that go
against your programming or
something

GERTY
Helping you is what I do

Sam 1 heads towards the airlock

Sam 1 goes on picking up equipment shoves it all into a
backpack he swiped from a peg

Sam 2 appears from the return vehicle corridor

SAM 2
What’s going on

SAM 1
There’s something I’ve got to do

OMITTED 118
IE SAM 1S ROVERMOON SURFACE -- DAY 119
Sam 1 at the wheel flooring the Rover -- he looks
possessed determined -- a man on a mission --

WIDE SHOT

Sam’s Rover approaches one of the many Jammers that we now
know circle the perimeter of the base

Sam 1 stops the Rover on the other side of the Jammer
Here outside the range of the Jammers he figures he might
be able to get a signal through to Earth

ON SAM as he removes his equipment from the backpack and
starts to uncoil wires -- inserts a small BATTERY PACK onto
the back of the VP sits the VP on his lap
Liberty Films © 2007 - Version 28 Shooting Script 2 11th Dec 07

The VP resembles a Play Station Portable with its small but
nonetheless high-quality screen

Sam isn’t sure who to contact at firstfinally he enters
some numbers from memory The VP shaking in his hands He
is nervous scared He disables the video mode on his end
so he is only sending audio

A moment of silence The VP seems dead

SAM 1
Come oncome on

Then the VP BEEPS -- the monitor BLIPS -- the message seems
to have gone through

And suddenly a GIRL appears on the screen
Sam 1 can’t believe it It’s the same Girl from his

hallucinations Same wheat-colored hair Same freckles
dotting her cheek bones Same yellow dress

The moment Sam 1 sees the Girl he thinks -- naturally --
that he’s imagining things again But then she speaks

GIRL
Hello

That’s never happened before Sam 1 finally manages to
respond

SAM 1
Uh Bell residence

The conversation has a very slight delay maybe a second or
two and the Girl isn’t completely clear on the monitor We
assume that these minor technical glitches are the same on
the Girl’s end

The Girl is sweet chirpy -- nothing like the haunting
ghost-like figure from Sam 1’s hallucinations

GIRL
This is the Bell Residence

SAM 1
I’m trying to reach Tess Bell

The girl’s expression shifts -- now somewhere between
melancholy and curiosity --

GIRL
I’m sorry she passed away some
years ago

Sam 1 GASPS He literally gasps Like someone just plunged
a paring knife into his belly
Liberty Films © 2007 - Version 28 Shooting Script 2 11th Dec 07

SAM 1
Nono way

The girl just stares

SAM 1 (CONT’D)
Tess Bell Are you sure

GIRL
Uh yeah I think so I’m her
daughter
(then)

Can I help you
And astonishingly the news of Tess’s death actually takes
a back seat as Sam 1 is forced to confront this new
revelation
The girl is EVE BELL Sam 1 is talking to his DAUGHTER

Sam 1 tilts his head a smile twitches on his face

SAM 1
Eve

Sam 1 can’t believe it She’s beautiful She’s beautiful

EVE BELL
Yes

A moment Eve distracted by her console trying to work out
why there is no image on her end and such a weird delay
Tears glistening in Sam 1s eyes

SAM 1
(overwhelmed)
Hi Hi Eve How old are you
now
For a second Eve is embarrassed -- she blushes slightly --

but is still pulled in intrigued

EVE BELL
I’m fifteen
(then)
Do I know you

SAM 1
How did mom die sweetheart

EVE BELL
Uh

Now Eve is beginning to look spooked She turns away from
the screen and calls to someone in another room

Liberty Films © 2007 - Version 28 Shooting Script 2 11th Dec 07

EVE BELL (CONT’D)
Dad

And then we hear a voice Sam’s voice

OLDER SAMS VOICE (0S)

What

EVE BELL
Dad there’s someone asking about
mom

Sam’s voice sounds CLOSER more SUCCINCT as he comes into
the room -- but we don’t see him yet -- he sounds OLDER

OLDER SAMS VOICE
Who’s asking about mom
Sam 1 hurriedly shuts off the VP
He sits there in the Rover on the Moon the middle of
nowhere -- hundreds and thousands of miles from Earth --
Sam 1 has never felt more alone than he does right now

Sam 2 hears a sound from the corridor Moments later Sam 1
appears in the doorway

Sam 1 is beginning to look alarmingly ILL His depleting
health has been evident throughout the film but now it
seems to have jumped to a new level

He watches Sam 2 for a little while

SAM 1
You suck

SAM 2
How do you carve these things

Sam 1 picks up a block of wood grabs an exacto blade
Demonstrates

SAM 1
You don’t hold it like you’re
trying to stab someone You got
to hold it closer to the blade

SAM 2
You’re shaking

Sam 2 isn’t kidding Though he is carving the block of
wood Sam 1 can’t keep it steady

SAM 2 (CONT’D)
Why are you shaking

SAM 1
Watch what I’m doing
(then)

Sam 1 hands the wood and exacto blade to Sam 2
Sam 2 attempts to carve He smiles a little embarrassed

SAM 1 (CONTD)
You’1l get the hang of it
(a beat)
You see that’s a little better
already

Suddenly Sam 1 turns around and has a vicious coughing fit

Sam 2 watches with concern Eventually the coughing
subsides He looks exhausted

SAM 2
What’s happening to you

Sam 1 averts his gaze Doesn’t want to talk about it

SAM 1
That crew they’re sending If
they find the two of us awake
like this you know they’re not
going to let us live right

SAM 2
You know that

Sam 2 asks but he already knows it’s true Sam 1 has shut

Lying in one of the Infirmary beds eyes closed a NETWORK
of WIRES attached to his chestSam We don’t know which
Sam it is yet He is clean shaven He looks like any one of
the clones down in the secret chamber then again he could
just as easily be Sam 2

And that’s what Sam 1 naturally assumes as he enters the
Infirmary and sees him lying there Sam 1 moves closer
curious until he is standing right at the edge of the bed

Sam 1 reaches out his hand to wake him up when there is a
voice from the doorway behind

SAM 2
Don’t touch him

Our suspicions are now confirmed The Sam in the Infirmary
bed is a new clone We will call him SAM 3

going to need your help hauling

SAM 2
I wish I could say I was going to
miss you buddy but to be
honest I can’t wait to get away
from here

GERTY
I understand Sam I hope life
is everything you remember it to
be

SAM 2
Thanks Are you sure you’re
going to be ok

GERTY
Of course The new Sam and I
will be back to our programming
as soon as I have finished
rebooting

SAM 2

Gerty we’re not programmed

We’re people
Gerty doesn’t respond Sam 2 seems troubled
Sam 2 leans forward and activates the Memory Erase button
Gerty’s READOUT SCREEN begins to TWITCH and FLASH with
RANDOM DATA -- then slowly FADES TO BLACK
The Robot has been officially SHUT DOWN

Gerty just stands there Completely still As lifeless as a
toy

Sam 2 heads out of the room at top speed

EXT MOON SURFACE -- NIGHT 154

Shot of JOHN the third of the Harvesters heading across
the lunar plane

INT MONITORING STATION -- NIGHT 155

Sam 2 pauses at the windowlooking for Eliza The Rescue
Unit is so close Sam 2 might actually be able to pick out
their spacecraft

And he can It’s tiny but nevertheless it’s there -- a
metallic spacecraft glinting like a jewel -- and heading
steadily towards the Moon

There isn’t a moment to lose Sam 2 swings around heads
for the CARGO CONTAINER

We remain inside the Monitoring Station as Sam 2 climbs
inside the Cargo Container He readies himself Says a
little prayer and he cant do it Cursing at himself and
glancing at the time ticking away before Eliza lands he
jumps back out of the CARGO CONTAINER and runs back into
the base

CUT TO

INT MONITORING STATION -- NIGHT CONTINUOUS 156

Sam 2 sits down before the Old Man Eliza’s imminent
arrival causing increased STRESS and TENSION

Sam 2 takes out the piece of paper on which the COORDINATES
of the Jammers are printed out

He starts to frantically type altering the PATH of MARK

EXT MARK -- NIGHT 157
Mark trundling along at half-speed The Harvester suddenly
changes direction -- veering sharply to the left and

heading up over a steep slope

CUT TO

INT MONITORING STATION -- NIGHT 158
Back on Sam 2 as he RAPIDLY types makes an error screams

SAM 2

Pounds the delete button continuing to type coordinates
into the Old Man -- He’s done He leaps out of his chair
and tears off through the base towards the cargo container

INT MOON BASE SARANGQUICK SHOTS 160
For a few moments all is quiet inside the base

The “PING-PING-PING” of the Old Man

The grinding GURGLE of a computer readout

This sequence echoes the tour at the very start of the

film but the base has a decidedly different feel to it
now It’s like an abandoned house

CUT TO
INT COMMS NOOK -- NIGHT 161
CLOSE UP -- THE OLD MAN
On the monitor “RESCUE UNIT ELIZA ARRIVED”
EXT ELIZAS SPACECRAFTMOON SURFACE 162

A box shaped spacecraft all menace and angles slowly
DESCENDING towards the lunar surface

CUT TO

INT INFIRMARY -- LATER 163
Gerty sits lifeless

We hear the sounds of pressure doors opening Unrecognized
voices as the landing crew enters the base calling for
Sam

Gerty comes to life

His principal monitor POPS ON and his pincer-like HANDS
begin to TWITCH His READOUT SCREEN streams with DATA

Gerty’s head begins to swivel left and right -- as if he’s
awoken with a stiff neck -- eventually he SEES Sam 3
crosses to him

Just like that Gerty continues his routine checks of Sam 3
-- studying Sam 3’s heartbeat his brain activity -- the
robot literally picking up where he left off

And then Sam 3’s eyes open He is awake He blinks at
Gerty cloudy groggy

SAM 3
Where am I

GERTY
Sam you’re in the Infirmary You
had an accident

Sam 3 staring ahead trying to dig up the memory

GERTY (CONT’D)
Do you remember what happened

SAM 3
No Gerty
(a beat)
I don’t remember a thing

We hear heavy footsteps and voices closer now just outside
the infirmary

CUT TO

EXT MARKJAMMERMOON SURFACE 164

A CLOSE UP of MARK as the Harvester churns along and SLAMS
into a JAMMER with full force

The Jammer wobbles unsteadily from the IMPACT before
finally TOPPLING over HAZING the air with lunar dust

CUT TO

EXT CARGO CONTAINERSPACE 165

The Cargo Container BULLETING through space fire blasting
from its jets like the petals of an exotic flower

CUT TO

INT CARGO CONTAINER 166

Sam 2 is seriously cramped inside one of the Helium 3
containers about as comfortable as a pony in a dog kennel
but nonetheless WHOOPING RAUCOUSLY at the sheer velocity of
the container -- as well as and perhaps even more so the
fact that he has successfully escaped the base

He’s going home

the tips of his fingers and then places his hand on her

IE CRASHED ROVERMOON SURFACE -- DAY BREAK 168
A shadow passes over the window of the crashed rover and
blocks out the light of the rising sun The figure raises
an arm He’s holding a weapon of some sort but

Sam 1 has already stopped breathing

The figure lowers his arm and moves away As he retreats
the sun pours in on Sam 1’s face through the rovers open
hatch

package on the floor outside A gift of some kind The
label says it’s for her from “a friend” She takes it
inside unwraps the box and finds SAM’S CARVED HOUSE
