CU CLOSED EYELIDS NIGHT 1

MARTIN (VO)
Can I explain why I want to kill
myself O0f course I can I’m
not an idiot

The eyelid opens

CU EYE NIGHT 2

The pupil rises sharply into focus as if taking a huge gulp
of air

INT BATHROOM NIGHT 3

MARTIN good-looking practised grin is staring into a
bathroom mirror He is dressed only in a dressing gown He
looks at himself long and hard

MARTIN (VO)
I can explain it because it’s not
inexplicable it’s a logical
decision the product of proper
thought

He opens a bathroom cabinet and takes out a nasal hair
trimmer He sticks the nasal hair trimmer into his nose and
begins to use it

INT BATHROOM LATER 4

MARTIN now has a face full of shaving foam as he carefully
shaves with a steel sharp-looking razor

MARTIN (VO)
Simply put the reason why I want
to die is because I don’t want to
live And you can’t get more
logical than that

He closes his eyes

INT CLOSED EYELIDS NIGHT 5
MARTIN (VO)
I’m taking all the mystery out of
it aren’t I
INT LIVING ROOM NIGHT 6

MARTIN walks into the living room - he’s now dressed and
dressed well

He walks past pictures of children we’ll later recognise as
his own and pictures of him and a woman we’ll later
recognise as Cindy then there are pictures of him beside a
woman carrying numerous daytime TV trophies this woman we’ll
later recognise as Penny

MARTIN picks up the letter he’s left on the mantelpiece he
puts it beside the phone

MARTIN (VO)
No Id go so far as to say
committing suicide is one of the
most logical things I’1ll ever
accomplish

He checks his watch He exits The camera stays in the room
MARTIN re-enters and picks up the letter he’s left by the
phone He picks it up and thinks - he puts it back on the
mantelpiece

EXT MARTIN’S APARTMENT BLOCK NIGHT 7

Martin steps out of his apartment block A nice apartment
block He thinks and then returns back into it We stay
looking at the door

MARTIN (VO)
Imagine you’re an - assistant bank
Manager in Guildford offered the
job of managing a bank in Sydney
Well even though it’s a pretty
straightforward decision youd
still think for a bit Maybe
write a pros and cons list

He returns - struggling out this time with a ladder under
his arm

MARTIN (VO)
On the cons aged parents who might
die when you’re on the other side
of the world friends you’1l miss
and a golf club where you know your
handicap is not laughed at

EXT DRIVEWAY NIGHT 8

MARTIN lashes ladder onto the roof of his car He does
energetically and without a great deal of skill

MARTIN (VO)
--on the pros more money better
quality of life sea sunshine
women with suntans a chance to
invent yourself as being someone
other than an assistant bank
manager from Guildford

He stops He breathes

INT CAR NIGHT 9

He starts the car He takes a toffee from his glove
compartment and shoves it into his mouth

MARTIN (VO)
Now I’m not an assistant bank
manager I haven’t got aged
parents they’re dead I don’t play
golf I hate the sport

He backs it out of the drive He drives down the street

MARTIN (VO)
But eighteen months ago I had
everything and then - I met
Danielle Thurby

He passes a woman he knows who is wearing devil horns and an
embarrassed grin She smiles And mouths ‘Happy New Year’ He
waves

MARTIN (VO)
Five feet nine inches thirty-six
double-D Fifteen years two-
hundred and fifty days old and yet
she looked twenty-five if a day I
didn’t even enjoy it Her It

EXT TOPPERS CAR PARK NIGHT 10

MARTIN parks up the car beside an office block which seems to
ascend into the sky - this is Toppers Tower He gets out of
his car looks up at the looming building for the briefest of
seconds and then starts to unlash his ladder

MARTIN (VO)
And now my wife hates me I can’t
see my kids I’ve a criminal
record a listing on the national
sex offenders register and have so
spectacularly pissed away my career
that I’m less successful than an
assistant bank manager in
GuildfordYup Suicide is my
Sydney

He puts the ladder beside the car He takes a bolt cutter and
a torch out of the boot He clips it on a buckle to his
trouser belt He puts the bolt cutter into his back pocket
where it sticks out precariously

MARTIN (VO)
No offence intended to the good
people of Sydney of course

INT TOPPERS TOWER NIGHT 11

MARTIN is waiting for the lift it arrives He attempts to
put his ladder inside It doesn’t fit

He tries it another way It doesn’t fit He tries it a
third way Yup Really doesn’t fit

INT TOPPERS TOWER STAIRCASE NIGHT 12

MARTIN takes the stairs carrying the ladder the torch
banging against his leg with every step He looks up the
staircase Only fourteen more flights to go Only - fourteen -
fourteen - exhaustion awaits

INT TOPPERS TOWER TOP OF STAIRCASE NIGHT 13
The door is bolted MARTIN is seriously out of breath

MARTIN takes out the bolt cutter He makes to break open the
bolt But the bolt has already been got to and slithers away
as soon as he touches it The door swings open effortlessly

MARTIN puts his bolt cutter back in his back pocket Then he
thinks better of it and takes the bolt cutter out of his
pocket and throws it on the floor He won’t be needing that
again

He takes a breath and then walks out through the open door

EXT TOPPERS TOWER ROOF NIGHT 14

The roof has three feet of barbed wire netting around the
outside of it with a metal strut at the edge of the wire
MARTIN lays his ladder horizontally so that it traverses

the barbed wire He takes out a cigar He tucks it behind
his ear

He puts the torch in his mouth and begins to crawl out on
his ladder Over the wire It’s a horrific and vertigo-
inducing watch

He wobbles at one point and clings on then he steels
himself and keeps going He reaches the end

He carefully manoeuvres himself into seated position He
refocuses himself

He sits as if on the edge of the world he puts the torch on
his lap he doesn’t look down - instead - he takes the cigar
from behind his ear and lights it

MAUREEN (0S)
Um Excuse me

MARTIN turns and looks at MAUREEN astonished there is
someone else up there with him MAUREEN is 40-something and
has a brave anxious smile on her face

MAUREEN (CONTD)
I’m not entirely sure how to
phrase this But Are you going
to be long

MARTIN
What

MAUREEN
I wasn’t sure whether to wait my
turn orI hadn’t considered

the wire I’d really like to
borrow your ladder If that’s

There is a moment’s pause

MAUREEN (CONTD)
Maybe I should just wait I’1l

wait

MARTIN
Right

MAUREEN
Sorry

MARTIN
No No

MARTIN turns back to facing the night sky frowns and turns
back to MAUREEN his concentration gone

MARTIN (CONTD)
You’re just going to stand there
and watch are you

MAUREEN
No No Of course You’1l be
wanting to do it on your own I’d
imagine

MARTIN
Youd imagine right

MAUREEN
Ill go over there

She indicates the door She begins to walk over to it He
half laughs

MARTIN
I’1l give you a shout on the way
down

MAUREEN attempts half a smile

MAUREEN
Right

MAUREEN stands quietly - looking towards MARTIN and then
turns around He checks what’s she doing and then

He composes himself He feels the mood take him He takes a
puff of his cigar He looks out forward maybe he even
lifts himself up ready to propel himself out

And then he drops the cigar - from his mouth And then
reaches out to grab it and in doing so almost overbalances
over the edge of the tower Fuck It’s a long way down He
grabs the edge and regains his balance

EXT TOPPERS TOWER NIGHT 15
The cigar tumbles down the side of the building and we go

with it Turning in the night air our stomachs lurching The
drop is further and faster than we’d ever have anticipated

EXT STREET NIGHT 16

The cigar lands with a bounce Then it lies still Then a
truck roars over the top of it

The camera closes on a cigar lying brutally flattened on the
road

EXT TOPPERS TOWER ROOF NIGHT 17
MARTIN wobbles he looks down He points the torch down He
can’t see the drop He thinks He thinks again He looks
down He announces

MARTIN
I can’t Not with you watching

MAUREEN
Oh

He looks at her she looks at him
MAUREEN (CONTD)
I could leave come back in
twenty minutes
MARTIN thinks and then frowns

MARTIN
Maybe you should go first

MAUREEN registers this
She thinks She turns thoughts over in her head
MAUREEN
I’d - want to be on my own
Completely On my own
MARTIN
Understood Twenty minutes Then I
want my spot back
MAUREEN thinks and then nods

MAUREEN
Right OK

He thinks and then starts crawling back along the ladder
The ladder wobbles again MARTIN’s survival instinct comes
in again - he lies still a moment He looks at MAUREEN She
puts out a hand

MAUREEN (CONT’D)
Maureen

MARTIN stands They shake hands

MARTIN
Martin
MAUREEN
Are you from I recognise your
face
MARTIN
Do you

They realise they’re still shaking hands They stop

MAUREEN
Were you married to someone in a
pop group

MARTIN

No

MAUREEN remembers
MAUREEN
Were you on TV

She thinks Slightly excited now

MAUREEN (CONTD)
Mushrooms You like mushrooms

MARTIN
Mushrooms

MAUREEN
You said I remember There was one
of those chefs in the studio -
moustache - and he gave you
something to taste and you said
‘Mmmm I love mushrooms I could
eat them all day’ Was that you

MARTIN digests this

MARTIN
Maureen Perhaps now’s not the time
for small talk

MAUREEN smiles at MARTIN She looks at the ladder She knows
what this means

MAUREEN
Well I’llum

MARTIN
YesI’1l just - leave you for -

Which is when they hear a door bang behind them JESS 18
stands with mascara running down her cheeks She is dressed
for a New Year’s Eve party high heels the works She looks
at the two of them - confused

She sees the ladder she frowns and then she starts running
hard for it She almost makes it

But MARTIN grabs her by her belt She kicks him in the
face but he hangs on and pulls her backwards onto the
roof

JESS
No No

He is really having trouble keeping hold of her

MARTIN
Calm down Calm down

She wriggles away She makes for the ladder again this
time he full on rugby tackles her They fall to the ground
with an oooof
JESS
Who the fuck are you

JESS tries to stick her fingers into MARTIN’s eyes She is
wild on something

MARTIN
Ow Maureen Bit of help

JESS
Youre getting a thrill out of
this aren’t you - pervert

The struggle continues MAUREEN is anxious not to
intervene

MAUREEN
What do you want meto do

JESS looks up at MARTIN She recognises him

JESS
Oh my God You’re Martin Sharp You
are a pervert Officially

MAUREEN
That’s it Rise and Shine with
Martin and Penny

MARTIN
Sit on her will you

MAUREEN hesitates and then sits on Jess and MARTIN kneels
on her arms

JESS
Just let me go Let me go

MARTIN turns and looks at her amazed at her balls Then a
phone begins to ring

And they look to their own phones MARTIN stands MAUREEN
stands JESS stands And they look at each other It’s not
their phones ringing

The phone continues to ring MARTIN flashes his torch around

the roof looking for the culprit It alights onJJ - he is

sitting cross-legged on the opposite edge of the tower block
He’s wearing a crash helmet and he has an insulated pizza bag
on his lap with ‘Paulo’s Pizzas’ printed on it

JI
Hi

He talks with an American accent They all stare at him He
thinks and then takes off his helmet - he’s mid-20’s shy
looking He shuts off his phone and smiles - unsure

JJ (CONT’D)
Any of you guys order a pizza

MARTIN
How long - have you been - there

JT
I don’t - know

JESS starts to laugh

JESS
Well if you’re here for the death
ride there’s a queue

TITLES A LONG WAY DOWN

EXT TOPPERS TOWER ROOF NIGHT

They are in exactly the same positions JESS grins as she
looks at the other three

JESS
So do we do introductions I’m
Jess People call me Jess

MAUREEN
I’m Maureen

Jd
JJ

MARTIN
I’m -

JESS
Martin Sharp

MARTIN
Yes

JESS

Quite exciting to have a celebrity
in our suicidal midst

The word ‘suicidal’ seems to make everyone wince

JESS (CONTD)
(as if it’s small talk)
So - what made everyone chose
Toppers Tower

No-one says anything JESS thinks and then takes the pizza
from JJ and opens the box She grins at the contents She
seems to be enjoying herself None of the others are

JESS (CONTD)
Ham and Pineapple Really And it’s
cold No-one fancies jumping down
and getting some pepperoni do they

No-one laughs No-one says anything JESS looks at them all
and begins to eat

JESS (CONTD)
No-one fancies a slice What Not
going to deliver it now is he

MAUREEN looks at MARTIN and then JJ

MAUREEN
Thisthis feels wrong

JJ looks at MAUREEN Thinking

JESS
Maybe we could jump
togetherOne Two Three

She makes for the ladder But MARTIN is too quick and kicks
it out of the way It falls through the wire and descends
heavily to the ground far below MARTIN watches
itanxiously It lands with a distant smash - a car alarm
blares JESS laughs

Then suddenly it begins to rain They wait Looking at each
other

MARTIN looks up at the skies He thinks

MARTIN
Nice to meet you - all

He exits the rooftop He leaves everyone else behind

The remaining three exchange a look - unsure what to do with
themselves - and the rain gets heavier still

INT MARTIN’S CAR NIGHT 19

MARTIN sits looking numb He’s numb with shock His skin has
a greyish pallor to it

The rain drums incessantly on the windscreen He turns on the
radio He turns it off again He turns on the windscreen
wipers - but they’re slightly broken - there’s a weird pause
in the middle of their rotation - oh and they squeak

MARTIN just looks at the world And then - suddenly - he
hammers the steering wheel with his hand And then he regrets
hammering the steering wheel This is both raw pain and you
know slightly pathetic

MARTIN starts the car He begins to drive

He drives past MAUREEN standing in the rain at a bus stop
She disrupts the thought

He thinks He stops the car He looks back at her He
reverses it back
EXT STREET NIGHT 20

MAUREEN is standing fastening a carrier bag onto her head as
a make-shift hood

MARTIN (0S)
Do you want a lift

MAUREEN
No No The bus will be along in -
fifteen minutes

MARTIN looks at her gruffly

MARTIN
Get in the car Maureen

MAUREEN thinks and then does

INT MARTIN’S CAR NIGHT 21

MAUREEN looks around and smiles at MARTIN they’re still
nervous of each other

MAUREEN
I did like your television show

MARTIN doesn’t answer they lapse back into silence
They drive past JJ - trying to get a Pizza moped started in

the rain MAUREEN looks at JJ MARTIN looks at MAUREEN
MARTIN stops the car

MARTIN
Tonight is really not going how I
expected
EXT STREET NIGHT 22

MARTIN drives past JESS Who is walking purposively along the
street

MARTIN’s car stops JESS runs to the car and then looks
inside

JESS
Bit early for a reunion isn’t it

MARTIN
Get in We’re taking you home

INT MARTINS CAR NIGHT

MARTIN is moderately dry everyone else looks like drowned
rats They drive in silence

MARTIN
So this is - jolly

JESS
Maybe we should have some sort of
group therapy Right here Right
now Maybe that’s what destiny
wants Take a right here

MARTIN does take a right

JESS (CONT’D)
OK One word answers You can all
have one word answers which address
exactly why you were up on the roof
in the first place

No-one says anything

JESS (CONTD)
To give an example Martin might
say notoriety

MARTIN
Are you trying to get us to share
our feelings Because I’m not sure
this is the best way

JESS
To give another example Maureen
might say loneliness

MAUREEN looks at JESS hurt

MAUREEN
Is that what you think

JESS turns to JJ JJ doesn’t want her to turn to him

JESS
And then there’s our pizza boy

JI
JJ
JESS
Do you mind if I call you pizza boy-
JI
Yeah
JESS

Pizza boy Why might pizza boy want
to die I’m guessing -

JI
What would be your reason I can
tell you’re dying to tell us

JESS
Dying to tell you See what he did
there No My reasonLove The

oldest most fucking chestnutty
chestnut of them all

MAUREEN turns - surprised by the swearing
JESS (CONTD)
Chas He spurned me I’m a spurned
woman (she smiles broadly) Take a
left
MARTIN takes a left

MAUREEN
I am not lonely

JESS
Tell that to your cats

MAUREEN
I don’t have cats

JESS is shocked

JESS
Really

JJ is thinking

MARTIN
Are we not fitting into your pre-
ordained boxes Jess

JESS
Actually you fill your one
marvelously - was prison fun

MARTIN
You really believe you have an
answer for everything don’t you

JESS
I really believe you are a
miserable bastard

MARTIN
Actually right now a miserable
bastard is exactly what I am Have
I not been hiding it well

MAUREEN interrupts

MAUREEN
I was up there because I
felthelpless

JI
And I was up there because I have
cancer I have inoperable cancer

JESS smiles broadly and punches his arm

JESS
We have a winner Fucking
brilliant

MAUREEN turns - ready to say something about the swearing -
but she doesn’t

JESS (CONTD)
Very impressed Embarrassing
cancer

JJ hesitates

JT
Brain CCR

JESS
Colon would have been better

MAUREEN
I’m sorry JJ

JI
Oh it’s largely self-inflicted
few too many drinks and drugs you
know

JESS
Right Pull up here

MARTIN pulls the car to a stop

They look up at the squalid house they’re outside of they
listen to the pumping music it’s emitting There is a party
going on

MAUREEN
Here You live here

JESS
No But Chas is likely to be here
And I’ve got things to say to him

She looks around the car

JESS (CONTD)
Well Good luck with your next
attempts See you in the afterlife

She exits the car

EXT PARTY HOUSE NIGHT 24

She stands looking up at the party And for a moment her face
is that of a little vulnerable girl - she takes a breath
steels herself and enters the house

INT MARTINS CAR NIGHT 25

MARTIN drives with steady intensity The broken windscreen
wipers grow ever more annoying

MARTIN
I should have thought The most
popular suicide spot in London on
the most popular night for
suicides I should have thought
I wouldn’t bealone

JI
Didn’t occur to me either if that
makes you feel any better

MAUREEN looks at MARTIN

MAUREEN
Unhappy little thing isn’t she

MARTIN chooses to ignore the gentle prodding of MAUREEN

MARTIN
Where am I dropping you JJ

MAUREEN
I don’t know why she thought I’d
have cats and she certainly swears
too much But

MARTIN looks at MAUREEN

MARTIN
Go on Maureen Just say it

MAUREEN
I justshould she be alone

MARTIN stops the car Again No-one says anything MARTIN
sighs

INT PARTY HOUSE HALLWAY NIGHT 26

MAUREEN MARTIN and JJ enter through a broken front door
MAUREEN looks around - extremely worried It’s a loud and
quite aggressive party It’s full of people who look like
they don’t belong anywhere but here and our three stand out
like sore thumbs JJ has to shout over the music

JT
Martin take the stairs Maureen
take the bathroom I’1ll take the
dance floor

MARTIN
No I

JJ interrupts

JI
What else we gonna do

JJ heads off into the crowds MARTIN thinks and then copies

JJs bravery MAUREEN lingers a moment more - looking
immensely uncomfortable - and then follows them both

INT PARTY SQUAT LIVING ROOM NIGHT 27

MARTIN walks slightly disorientated through the crowds
This party really is a rampaging beast

He looks this way and that but this really ishe doesn’t
know what he’s looking for

MARTIN
Hi

He tries to stop a youth moving through the room The youth
looks at MARTIN like he’s pointless

He feels pointless MARTIN tries again

MARTIN (CONTD)
Hi I’m looking for

Again he’s ignored MARTIN sits on a sofa In the background
we see MAUREEN edging around the edge of the room

A girl sits beside him She looks at him and then strokes
his face

SHANAY
Hi

MARTIN
Hi I’m looking for a girl
called

She strokes his face again

SHANAY
Hi

MARTIN
Jess Do you know the name Jess

She looks at him for three seconds and then instantly
falls asleep On his shoulder MARTIN looks at her a
moment

MARTIN (CONT’D)
Good Great Perfect

Then people start chanting

CROWD
Ten Nine

MARTIN realises what’s happening He extricates himself from
the girl and lies her down against the arm of her sofa

CROWD (CONTD)
Eight Seven

He aims for the exit But he literally can’t get through
MARTIN looks for somewhere to hide He spots a staircase

He aims up it

INT PARTY HOUSE STAIRCASE NIGHT 28

CROWD
Six Five Four

MARTIN takes the stairs two at a time He opens the exit at
the top
EXT PARTY HOUSE ROOF NIGHT 29

MARTIN takes several deep breaths He really doesn’t want
to be here tonight

Then two people come out after him And he looks for
somewhere to hide He wedges himself beside a sort of grill
in the corner

PEOPLE
Three Two One Happy New Year

There’s an audible cheer from the house and the streets
outside There’s an audible cheer throughout London
Fireworks ignite throughout the streets London is
beautiful The two people kiss MARTIN winces

CHAS (0S)
Hey

MARTIN turns surprised He didn’t realise he had company
CHAS is sort of sitting underneath the grill

MARTIN
Oh Um Hi Hiding too are you

CHAS
Yeah I mean sort of - I can’t
come into the light

MARTIN
Is that - comfortable

CHAS
You get used to it I’ve taken
some pills All good

MARTIN laughs he likes this guy

CHAS (CONTD)
What you hiding from

MARTIN
Oh you know - humans - humanity -
humankind You

CHAS’s eyes are as round as saucers

CHAS
A nutter who is trying to kill me

MARTIN
Your reason is better than mine
then And where is this - nutter

CHAS
She’s everywhere

MARTIN
She’s God-like I see

CHAS
I’m hoping I’m just having a bad
pill But she’s not supposed to be
here and I’m pretty sure I just saw
her Though I’m also pretty sure
I’ve seen you on breakfast TV so
maybeyou know I mean it
actually could be a good pill
and I don’t

MARTIN looks at CHAS and then smiles softly

MARTIN
You’re Chas aren’t you

CHAS looks back and frowns

CHAS
How d’you know that

MARTIN
I’m here with the - nutter

CHAS looks at MARTIN like he’s dangerous then tries
rapidly to escape

This is easier said than done He bangs his head on the
underside of the grill

MARTIN (CONT’D)
Chas Chas Listen to me Let’s
go find her together What’s the
worst that can happen

CHAS turns to him with incredulity

CHAS
She’s tried to kill me twice got
me arrested once I’m banned from
three pubs two clubs a cinema
and a hairdressers

MARTIN
Ok So the worst that can happen
isbad but

CHAS stops and sways and looks at MARTIN more carefully
CHAS
Look Just let me leave quietly
I did nothing wrong
MAUREEN (0S)
Nothing wrong Taking her to bed

Nothing wrong

MAUREEN appears in the background of shot

CHAS
No more drugs for this man
MAUREEN looks at MARTIN and shrugs
MAUREEN
All these people - and you should
have seen the toilets-
MARTIN smiles acknowledgement
CHAS

I’m off -to a monkery - monastery
- I’m becoming you know a monk

MAUREEN
You owe her the courtesy of talking
to her

CHAS

She won’t talk She’1ll chase me
with a bread knife -

MAUREEN
And tonight she was prepared to
end her life because of what you
did to her

CHAS wobbles Suddenly sober MARTIN looks concerned But
MAUREEN is determined to let her bitterness hang on

CHAS
What

MARTIN
Maureen I think that’s a bit
(much)

MAUREEN

That’s where we met her On top
of a tower block Preparing to -
you know

MAUREEN is clearly very upset CHAS wobbles slightly again

CHAS
What

Then JJ bursts through the doors He looks at MARTIN and
then at MAUREEN

JT
It’s Jess I think she’s taken an
overdose

30 OMITTED 30

INT HOSPITAL NIGHT
JESS is pushed hard through the hospital

She’s trying to speak She’s bucking hard She’s deathly
white

MARTIN follows the trolley MAUREEN CHAS and JJ two steps
behind

MARTIN
Jess Jess

NURSE
Are you her father

MARTIN is slightly offended by the question

MARTIN
No

JESS manages to get some words out

NURSE
Next of kin Are you next of kin

MARTIN
No No

The trolley is moving quickly MARTIN has to half run to
keep up

NURSE
Sir I need her full name

MARTIN
I only - she’s called Jess - I
didn’t - none of us knew her
before tonight

Another nurse is going through JESS’s pockets
NURSE 2
She’s got no identification on
her No nothing
MARTIN half-smiles but not in a good way
MARTIN
She probably didn’t want to make
identification easyI think
she likes things - difficult
The NURSE looks at him coldly

NURSE
You need to wait here

The hospital double doors close on the action MARTIN
stands a moment unsure whether to force himself in behind
them

He looks at his reflection in the glass of the door He rubs
his face

MARTIN
Right then
INT HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM NIGHT 32
MAUREEN MARTIN and JJ sit in a line in a green-soaked
waiting room CHAS is lying on one of the other benches

Curled up Asleep With a thumb in his mouth

There is a small television in the corner Blaring out
images of Hogmanay

MAUREEN
Do you think shedo you think she
meant it She doesn’t seem like she
meant it
MARTIN looks at MAUREEN

MARTIN
How do you seem like you mean it

MAUREEN considers the question
MAUREEN
Well I suppose you go through with
it
This is a dark thought It settles uneasily on the room
JI
She has We haven’t I need some
air
JJ stands and walks out
MAUREEN thinks looks at MARTIN and then follows JJ
MARTIN thinks and then follows MAUREEN

CHAS is left alone Curled up in foetal position

EXT HOSPITAL CAR PARK NIGHT 33

MARTIN’s car is parked in an empty car park looking up at
the hospital JJ MAUREEN and MARTIN stand against it

MARTIN gets out a cigar and lights it He hands it
wordlessly to JJ Who takes a puff and hands it to MAUREEN
who smiles doesn’t puff and hands it to MARTIN

JI
The rain’s stopped

MAUREEN checks her watch MARTIN rubs his eyes and smiles

MARTIN
Late for something

MAUREEN looks at him guiltily
MAUREEN
My son’s home in three hours And
- Matty’s breakfast is quite
complicated

MARTIN is surprised

MARTIN
You have a son

MAUREEN reads his surprise
MAUREEN
I don’t If I’m not going to
die tonight it’s important he
doesn’t know anything - happened

MARTIN nudges MAUREEN she sees what he sees

EXT HOSPITAL ENTRANCE NIGHT 34

JESS is coming out of the fluorescently tinged hospital
dressed in a gown wearing nothing on her feet

She sees them looking at her She pulls a dance move
Saturday Night Fever style Then she coughs Then she
starts to walk towards them

She walks a little like John Wayne They watch her

approach

EXT HOSPITAL CAR PARK NIGHT 35
She stands and looks at them a beat Looked at closely she

has charcoal smears at the corners of her mouth She smiles
at them all
JESS
OK So a few things to clarify
One my gown is open backed
because they’ve stolen my
clothes so I’m going to twirl so
you can look at my arse once

She twirls We get a look at her arse

JESS (CONTD)
But please don’t look again It’s
not my best feature I’m not
telling you what that is until I
know you better Two It wasn’t
an overdose It was an accident

MARTIN
Jess

JESS
I just took some pills - for fun -
and then took some moreI’d
never kill myself with pills -
jumping off a tower block is way -
way - cooler

And then she laughs but no-one else laughs

JI
We were worried Jess

Her face grows more serious She looks at JJ

JESS
That’s four Three Four I’m
losing count Thanks For you
know caring appreciate it

MARTIN
He was worried I was trying to
work out why we were still here

JESS
And that’s five Four Five Oh

thinking We’ve gone too far We
need to make a pact

MAUREEN
What

JESS
And six Is it just me or is it

INT HOSPITAL CAFETERIA NIGHT 36

MAUREEN JESS and JJ sit beside a vast open airport-style
window looking out on a London vista

MARTIN approaches them carrying two coffees and two cokes He
stops a moment looks at them thinks and then carries on
towards them

He sets the drinks down JESS grabs one of the cans and opens
it

JESS
When’s the next date After New
Years Eve When every one kills

themselves
MARTIN
Why -
MAUREEN

Valentine’s Day
JESS looks at MAUREEN and smiles that is a good answer

JESS
That’s six weeks Here’s the
pact No-one kills themselves
until then

There’s a brief silence as everyone tries to digest this

MARTIN
Why Why would we do that Why
would we not kill ourselves if
and when and how we want

JESS
Because we’ve met each other now -
because - you stopped me - twice -
you Martin But mostly because -

JESS thinks she’s trying here She starts to play with the
salt and pepper pots in front of her - almost acting out a
scenario

JESS (CONTD)
You know that bit in films where
people fight up the top of the
Empire State building - and there’s
the bit when the baddie slips off
and the hero tries to save him but
the baddie’s sleeve rips off and
you hear him all the way down
Aaargh

MARTIN
You want to watch me - plunge to my
doom

JESS

I’d like to know I’ve made the
effort I want to show people I’ve
made the effort

There’s a silence A soft tissue silence

JESS (CONTD)
Besides what’s the alternative A
race to finish Me checking the
obituaries every week to see if
Martin Sharp is dead

She looks at JJ and MAUREEN

JESS (CONTD)
No offence your deaths won’t make
the papersThink about it It’s
only six weeks

MAUREEN is thinking hard She looks at JJ who’s thinking
too and MARTIN who’s frowning

MAUREEN
It isn’t so ridiculous Andno-
one really knows how I feel except
you three sowell Just ‘til
Valentines Day I’d like that

JESS turns and smiles at MAUREEN surprised at her ally
JESS
Thank you Maureen Who’s got a
pen

JJ gets out a pen

JESS (CONT’D)
Paper

MAUREEN thinks and pulls out a piece of paper

MAUREEN
Paper

JESS speaks as she writes in a faux posh accent
JESS
The undersigned do hereby promise
not to kill themselves until
Valentine’s Day Maureen sign

MAUREEN nods and signs

JESS (CONTD)
Pizza boy sign

JT
But

JESS
Just do it You’re dying anyway
Makes no odds to you

JJ thinks hesitates looks up at them all as if about to say
something and then changes his mind and signs

JESS signs after him

JESS (CONTD)
And then there’s you
Martinlife saver Superman

The two hold eye contact for a moment

JESS (CONTD)
It’s only six weeks We’1ll all push
you off the top ourselves at the
end of it if that helps Be a
little Valentines’ Day treat

MARTIN
I’m pretty sure we’re going to live
to regret this

JESS grins MARTIN signs

JI
Guys Look

JJ indicates - the sun is coming up Breaking low over the
London landscape They all turn and stare at it

MAUREEN
(soft so soft)
So it is a new year then

MARTIN
Yeah

And the four stand together looking up at the dawn sky

JESS
Hang on Maureen Just a
fucking question here

JESS has unfolded the piece of paper which they’ve written
their pact upon MAUREEN turns towards her

JESS (CONT’D)
Have we written our pact on your
suicide note

MAUREEN blushes and then smiles

MAUREEN
Oh Yes There is that

JESS laughs first Then MARTIN And then everyone laughs
And properly And then they stop Because it sort of isn’t
that funny But the smiles remain

CU FINGERS DAY 37

A hard and heavy pumping beat This world is visually and
rhythmically different to the world we’ve been in If
Martin’s soundtrack was Bruce Springsteen then we’re now in
the land of Tinchy Stryder

JESS (VO)
It surprised me to hear that
invisibility is a technical
possibility

CU FINGERNAILS DAY 38

Theyre badly chipped and covered in three chipped layers of
different coloured nail polish - gold silver and red
Theyre carefully applying lip salve to a set of lips JESS’s
own lips

JESS (VO)
It was in this book that Chas
owned
EXT BUSY STREET DAY 39

JESS walks down a street Like she owns it She has the
purpose of an SAS soldier on a secret mission

Her phone begins to ring She looks to see who is calling
She walks into the middle of the road She disconnects the
call

A car slams on its breaks to stop from hitting her It beeps
loudly JESS turns looks at it aggressively and then raises
her top and flashes her bra at the aggrieved driver

JESS (VO)
I can’t remember the theory
exactly It was something about
defracting light Good word
Defracting Chas didn’t really
understand it I didn’t either
But you know good to know I
think invisibility being a
technical possibility

Her phone rings again This time it has ‘The Minister’ on
it She looks at it frowns and then disconnects

She looks up breaks into a small run and then slows down
She IS on a mission

JESS (VO)
Not that I’ve ever wanted to be
invisible But sometimes - I don’t
like to be seen

We follow her POV - she’s watching a man walk down the street
holding a guitar case

He turns and looks towards her JESS dodges behind a bin
He turns into a small pawn shop
JESS follows him

JESS (VO)
I follow them allNot just him

EXT STREET DAY 40

She sits on a bench obscured by a pillar watching JJ
through the glass of a pawn shop display window

JESS (VO)
It’s important to me - everyone
sticks to the pact You see the
thing about me is I’m very
contractual by my very nature

JJ hands over his guitar and takes money in return

JESS (VO)
It’s a trust thing and according
to my fifth therapist - who I tried
to stab with a letter opener - I
have slight trust issues

Someone sits on the bench opposite her They open their
newspaper

JESS (VO)
So I follow them all Just to -
check

The front cover reads ‘TV’S MARTIN SHARP IN SUICIDE BID
WITH MINISTERS DAUGHTER’

JESS looks at it Frowns
Then her phone starts ringing again

She looks at it She answers it

JESS
OK To clarify Now I know why
youre ringing

41 EXT RIVERBANK DAY

JESS approaches a middle-aged man in a suit CHRIS who is
reading a large newspaper

CHRIS looks at his daughter for a beat then dismisses the
thought

CHRIS
You did what you did

JESS

CHRIS

twist my words all day Because
this is hard enough
JESSS face grows cold

JESS
Is it Sorry Dad

JESS starts to walk away

CHRIS

JESS bangs hard into a man coming in the opposite direction

JESS
Will you fucking watch where

It’s MARTIN

JESS (CONTD)
What are you doing here

MARTIN
UhI was invited A Junior
Minister’s daughter - I was
surprised

JESS turns to look at her Dad who is now standing behind her

JESS
You were invited

CHRIS
I called his agent So we could all
talk -

JESS
You called his agent

JESS turns back to MARTIN She truly is piggy in the middle

MARTIN
He was delighted First call he’d
had in a while Was it you - who
went to the press

JESS scowls

JESS
No You think I’d want this I’ve
been trying to work that one out
myself

MARTIN
JJ

JESS
Too shy Maureen

MARTIN’s face answers that one JESS has a despairing
thought

JESS (CONT’D)
Chas Fucking Chas It was Chas He
sold us

MARTIN nods - that makes sense

MARTIN
My ex-wife rang this morning -
asking what I’d done - asking me
what she should tell the children

JESS
I’m going to kill him

CHRIS
Who’s Chas

MARTIN
She told me I seem to be the only
person in the world that the press
gets bang on If they say I’ve
slept with a fifteen year old I
generally have If they say I’ve
contemplated suicide I generally
have

CHRIS is looking at him the words ringing loud

CHRIS
Yes I read about that with the -
girlYou didn’tyou two
arent

JESS
Oh God You’re asking whether we’ve
slept together aren’t you

MARTIN looks at CHRIS - who is this guy He starts to laugh

MARTIN
Jesus Really You think I’d -

JESS
Oi I am at least legal

MARTIN
Yeah and I value our friendship too
much to complicate it

JESS raises her finger at MARTIN’s irony CHRIS smiles
relieved

CHRIS
Which is an interesting - area -
um will you maintain a
relationship with Jess

MARTIN smiles an incredulous smile

JESS
Of course he will we’re in a gang

MARTIN
We’re not in a gang

JESS
We signed a pact

MARTIN
Ah yes the pact I almost forgot

He turns to CHRIS with a weary lack of enthusiasm

MARTIN (CONT’D)
Jess and I are friends for ever

JESS looks at MARTIN - angry at his sarcasm CHRIS sits on a
bench He looks at his daughter and then back at MARTIN

CHRIS
MartinI’m sure I don’t need to
tell a man with your media training
that this is a firestorm

JESS looks at them both coldly She puts on a faux posh
voice

JESS
Yeah This is a media firestorm
Gentlemen I’1l leave you to it

JESS storms off

CHRIS
Jess Jess Jess Come back here

JESS turns around violently

JESS
Why don’t you invite him to my
therapy sessions Or - better yet
- our family therapy - maybe you
can pay him to be you

CHRIS
Martin doesn’t want my money

He looks at MARTIN

CHRIS (CONT’D)
Do you I mean

MARTIN barks a laugh

JESS
You wouldn’t even have this in our
house

CHRIS

The press will be there I was
trying to protect you

JESS looks at her Dad - furious - and then continues away
through the trees - running this time - a jogger has to dodge
out of the way she’s so determined - CHRIS doesn’t chase

CHRIS (CONT’D)
Jess Walking away solves
nothing

But she’s long gone

MARTIN and CHRIS stand uncomfortably looking up at the
empty space JESS has left

CHRIS (CONTD)
Did that go as badly as I think it
did

MARTIN
Has anyone ever told you you’re a
bit of an idiot

CHRIS smiles sadly

CHRIS
I’m a politician No-one ever tells
me anything but

MARTIN thinks and then thinks again He looks at CHRIS
coldly

MARTIN
Sort your own mess out
EXT PARK DAY 42

EXT JESS’S HOUSE DAY 43

JESS walks up to her very plush town house but has to push
her way through a gaggle of reporters to do so Easier said
than done

As she passes and disappears into a throng of press a
reporter talks direct to camera

REPORTER
This is the second tragedy for the
Crichton family after the
disappearance of older sister
Jennifer two years ago

The throng moves as a blob as Jess tries to move through it
We travel inside and see her fighting for air both literally
and metaphorically

REPORTER (0S) (CONT’D)

Jennifer was never found And you

have got to wonder how shadow

Education Secretary Chris Crichton

will cope with this new strain upon

him
INT JESS’S BEDROOM JESS’S HOUSE DAY 44
JESS is lying on her bed
Her bedroom is decorated how you’d imagine Jess’s bedroom
might be decorated She begins to gently sing the words to
Tragedy by the Bee Gees (but she knows the Steps version)

JESS

Jd
Jess

Cut wide and MATTY is sitting in a special chair in the
centre of the room He is 22 and has severe cerebral palsy
and severe (related) learning difficulties He is almost
entirely incapable of speech or movement

MAUREEN
He doesn’t - I don’t - what does
that mean Wow

JESS
I mean - wow - this what you were

hiding in here

JI
Jess Enough

JESS turns and looks at JJ Surprised at him telling her off
Then she looks back at MAUREEN who is visibly upset

MAUREEN
I wasn’t - leaving him - that -
night - there was care -

JI
Maureen No-ones accusing you of-

MAUREEN
- social services would have been
forced to pay for proper care for
him But as it is I’m a sole
carer which is

She looks at MATTY she doesn’t like discussing this in
front of him
MAUREEN (CONTD)
The standard of care they can

provide It’s better - you can’t -

understand

MARTIN

Yes We can And I’m sure - certain

- youre a great Mum Maureen

MAUREEN looks up at MARTIN - does no-one understand

MARTIN (CONTD)
Now Shall we get back to the
matter in hand

MAUREEN turns to JESS fiercely One thought

MAUREEN

And I don’t hide him I’ve never
hidden him Never

JESS pulls her neck back slightly

MARTIN touches MAUREEN on the shoulder She
then she looks back at JESS

MARTIN
We’ve convened this meeting

infinitely forgettable

MARTIN
They won’t Leave us alone

Everyone realises MARTIN knows what he’s talking about

MARTIN (CONT’D)
They’1l find out where you live -
where Maureen lives

MAUREEN
They’1l be here

MARTIN looks at MAUREEN thinking hard

MARTIN
SoI’ve been thinking What
if we shift the goalposts

JI
Goalposts

MARTIN is nervous about this idea

MARTIN
Make it our story - not theirs
There’s even a possibility that we
might make some - money - out of
it

MAUREEN
Money

MARTIN
Yes money as an unemployed and
unemployable disgraced chat show
host I need it don’t you
Couldn’t you use it for Matty And
I’m sure JJ would like a break from
pizzas

MARTIN turns to MAUREEN

MAUREEN
I don’t want Matty in the papers

MARTIN
We can’t stop that But this way at
least we don’t lose out entirely
By telling our story

JI
What story There is no story We
went up we came down again

JESS
We could invent something

MARTIN focuses on MAUREEN
MARTIN
This way maybe - we can - slightly -
control the agenda They’ve sold
papers on the back of us
JJ considers this carefully - he nods at MARTIN
JI
If you think it’s right Martin
Yeah I’m in

MARTIN turns to MAUREEN

MAUREEN
WellIyes OK

Then as one our team turn to JESS - who looks at them
JESS

Dad to nick from But I
supposeif we made the story a
fun one

INT FUNCTION ROOM DAY 58

JESS
It was an angel We were visited by
an angel And he looked like Matt
Damon

INT FUNCTION ROOM DAY 59

MARTIN

MARTIN (CONT’D)

physical angel - it was more - did

INT FUNCTION ROOM DAY 60

JT

otherwise was

JESS
Yeah That’s how it went

INT JESS’S HOUSE KITCHEN NIGHT 67

at her food The silence is deadly

JESS looks at her Mother like she’s a stranger The family
turn back to eating

CHRIS
I had an interesting thing happen
today

HOPE
Did you

JESS

Let me guess Your second
daughter humiliated you on the
pages of the national press

CHRIS
Actually no I was in chambers
and

JESS

Someone said ‘Chris was that
your daughter on the pages of the
national press’

CHRIS snaps back

CHRIS
If you want to make this about
something Jess we can Do you

JESS
Yes I want this to be about
something I want you to admit
youre angry with me I want you
to admit you’re mad

CHRIS thinks and then makes to say something and then
doesn’t and puts a potato in his mouth instead He chews it
thoughtfully

CHRIS
People have laughed at me for a
long time But I did prefer it when
they didn’t laugh at you

OK This stings JESS sits on her chair a little bit longer
CHRIS looks at her with gray eyes He’s furious But
containing it

CHRIS (CONT’D)
Angel You told them you saw an
angel

HOPE looks at her daughter - full of anguish

HOPE
Chris

CHRIS
And did it look like Jennifer were
you going to say that too

There is a silence That bites
JESS

No Dad No Daddy I didn’t say it
looked like Jennifer

JESS is almost in tears But not quite She smiles bravely

JESS (CONTD)
I said it looked like Matt Damon

INT PLUSH TELEVISION STUDIO DAY

JESS is having her face dusted with powder

PENNY comes onto the stage with her make-up napkin still

around her chin MAUREEN blushes when she sees her

overwhelmed by all of this

PENNY
Martin

MARTIN
Penny

PENNY

You’re thinner

MARTIN
You’re more or less the same -
though maybe you’ve put ona
little around the thighs

PENNY laughs fakely

PENNY
Still the dangerous sense of
humour I see

MARTIN
Still the vaguely supercilious grin
I see

Slightly

PENNY
Oh And you’re still using words
you don’t understand Howsweet

She turns to everyone with a practised smile

PENNY (CONTD)
Hi Everyone I’m Penny Now just
relax and remember that our
audience just want to see the
real you This should bethis
can bereal fun

PENNY thinks smiles at MARTIN again and then exits

The four lapse back into nervous silence

MAUREEN
This will be OK won’t it

MARTIN looks at JESS

MARTIN
Well be fine We’re going to go on
and shut this story down We just
need to - shift - the story away
from the silliness

JESS saying nothing frowns at them all

INT TELEVISION TITLES DAY

Rise and Shine with Penny theme music and titles

INT TELEVISION STUDIO DAY
PENNY smiles down the camera lens

PENNY
Now many of us have been
transfixed by the story of The
“Topper House Four” and the
“angel” that visited them And we
are so lucky here on ‘Rise and
Shine with Penny’ to have them
with us today

Slow pan over all the faces of our four They look
petrified They’re trying not to be

PENNY (CONT‘D)
One of them certainly needs no
introduction Martin Martin
Sharp my old co-host

MARTIN
Penny It’s an honour to be back
on this old sofa again And I
want to take this opportunity to
correct a few misconceptions
about this so-called angel and

PENNY smiles as she smoothly interrupts

PENNY
And well certainly get on to
that but - Martin it’d be remiss
of me not to start this interview
by giving the audience a bit of a
backstory on what’s happened to
you in the last twelve months

MARTIN nods

MARTIN
Yes Penny well I’m currently
juggling various job
opportunities concentrating on
being a father - and before that
I was in prison But what we
really want to talk to you about
is what we allegedly saw on that
roof -

We close on JESS her eyes are flicking from left to right
She’s extremely nervous

PENNY
And of course the reason you
went to prison was for sex with
an underage girl

A picture of Danielle Thurby flashes up on the screen behind
them It’s a paparazzi shot of her leaving a night club ina
sexy dress She does look 25 Martin looks at it and shrinks

MARTIN
With a fifteen year old girl yes

PENNY lays out a series of tabloid newspapers on the coffee
table in front of her They flash up on the screen too

PENNY
And here are some of the
headlines that Martin suffered -
and they were cruel weren’t they
Martin

MARTIN squints pure pain at PENNY She’s twisting the knife
and both know it

MARTIN
Yes

JESS wipes some sweat from her forehead it makes her make-
up smudge

PENNY
But many would say also deserved
And this incident - this sex -
offence - led you to losing your
job your family your home and
finally drove you to suicidal
feelings

MARTIN
That’s right Penny

PENNY turns and beams at the other three

PENNY
Which is where he met you lovely
people

JJ joins in desperate to help

JI
Yes We all met up there

PENNY
And where you saw your angel that
looked like “Matt Damon” do tell
me more

MAUREEN interjects
MAUREEN
It wasn’t an angel It was a light
We didn’t agree on an angel

PENNY turns to JESS

PENNY
Now Jess -

JESS smiles a panicked smile

JESS
Me next No Do the others first

PENNY smiles a kind TV smile

PENNY
- viewers of course will know you
mostly through your father Chris
Crichton Shadow Education
minister

JESS is actually genuinely very uncomfortable She seems to
be somehow holding her breath

JESS
Talk to JJ he’s much more
interesting-

PENNY
I’m sure he is I’m sure you’re all
fascinating But I do know your
story - and that of the devastating
disappearance of your sister
Jennifer deeply moved and
transfixed our audience

Jennifers face appears on the screen A picture of her and
Chris standing together - it’s formal but Chris looks proud
JESS turns to look at it and just melts Her eyes moisten

JESS
NoNo Maureen Talk to
Maureen Her son lives in a cage

PENNY laughs a TV laugh JESS stiffens more She’s being
backed into a corner here A tear rolls down her face

CUT TO

In a control booth above the set - on multiple screens are
pictures of Jess The cameras zoom in on her

PENNY (VO)
Yes we really do have so much to
chat about this morning but first
let’s focus on you Now I can see
youre getting upset it must have
been a terrible time

CUT TO

The studio as PENNY pushes a box of tissues towards JESS who
pushes them back MARTIN reads how upset JESS is getting

MARTIN
Penny maybe you should talk to
someone else -

PENNY chuckles

PENNY
My old co-host still trying to co-
host me there No tell me Jess
Was that what led you up there
Your struggle with your sister’s
disappearance must have been so
painful and the pain never dulls
does it

She pushes the tissues back at JESS who pushes them hard
back

JESS
I said - talk to Maureen - bitch

PENNY turns to camera Controlling her shock

PENNY
Viewers many apologies as you can
see emotions are running very high
in the studio this morning -

JESS is in tears
JESS
Why didn’t you listen to me you
fucking - why didn’t you listen

She rips off her microphone She starts to try and move away
move through the floor of cameras

MARTIN
Jess Jess

JESS
How do I get out of here This is a
fucking - maze

JESS charges off set - we cut between control booth and set
as everyone tries to put out the fires she’s started

PENNY
And well be back after the break
where Christie will tell us how to
make the perfect meringue

We close on MARTIN - looking utterly helpless

EXT STREET DAY 71

tear

really got into it you know - but
Mum - Mum right from the beginning -
just sort of - gave up Anyway at
least I don’t have cancer

She looks at JJ

JT
Yeah

JESS looks at him with an odd smile

JESS
You don’t have cancer do you I can
tell I can see it

JI
If I look healthy it’s because my
drug regime right now

JESS
Never seen you take a single pill

This floors JJ

JI
My drug regime is pretty minimal
right now so

JESS
JJ I’m a professional liar Youre
not even a competent one

JJ thinks and then thinks and then looks at JESS

JT
It was an accident It just -
came out And once it - came out
I couldn’t take it back

JESS laughs Almost surprised she’s right

JESS
Wow You lied about cancer That’s
like denying the holocaust Or
saying slavery was actually a good
idea You’re a racist You’re a
cancerist

JJ says nothing just nods JESS looks at him queerly

JESS (CONTD)
You really wanted to jump right
You weren’t just trying to deliver
pizza and then got too polite to
correct us

JI
I wanted to jump

JESS
Why

JJ considers this Biting his lip He hesitates

JESS (CONT’D)
It’s an easy enough question JJ

JJ turns to her - his face unsure He says nothing

JESS (CONTD)
Youre an embezzler A murderer A
paedophile OOOh Like Martin What
are the chances of that Four
suicidalists One roof Two of them
paedophiles That’s practically a
convention

JJ looks at her

JJ
I know I shouldn’t have - lied
Justcancer seemed - easier
JESS
(laughs )

Said the Leukaemia sufferer to the
Aids victim

JJ laughs and JESS looks at him pleased JJ looks back and
their eyes meet for a second and then he looks away She
stays looking at him

JESS (CONTD)
Youre a strange guy JJ But fuck
it I’m stranger I like sitting
outside the place my sister
disappeared from

JJ smiles but doesn’t look at her he has a thousand
thoughts in his head They sit in silence for a moment - then
he sees something

JT
Look

JESS
What

JT
Swifts

He points up to the sky She looks up She thinks about
making a joke But changes her mind

JJ (CONT’D)
You know my favourite thing about
swifts They nest on the wing
They’re born they’re fed but from
the moment they leave the birth
place they don’t come down for two
years until ready to create other
baby swifts

JESS looks at him - softly understanding - and then laughs
JESS
Oh my God You wanted to kill
yourself because you’re a bird
watcher That I understand

JJ puts his hand on hers - still watching the swifts And she
looks at his hand And it feels weirdand nice

JESS (CONTD)
How long ‘til Valentine’s Day

JI
Not so long

JJ makes to move his hand but she keeps hold of it

JESS
Have I ruined everything

JT
I don’t know

JJ turns away from the birds to look at her She looks at him
and then up at the birds

JESS
They don’t come down

JT
Cool isn’t it

And the camera pulls back On a young confused couple
sitting outside a Snooker Club

CU EAR DAY 73

Close on the ear

JJ (VO)
One elephant Two elephants Three
elephants Four

An alarm and some loudly monstrous music bangs in The ear
canal contracts

INT JJS BEDROOM DAY 74

JJ wakes with a start An alarm going beside his head - a
track plays Something annoying A flailing hand twiddles
with the dial until it finds something more acceptable And
something acceptable is - well - something quite JJ-ish
Animal CollectiveThe xxMouldy PeachesGrizzly Bear you know
the sort of thing

JJ climbs out of bed in his boxer shorts

JJ (V0)
There was only seven years between
the release of The Beatles first
album and their last Seven years
in which they changed the world
made a shitload of cash and
desecrated Christ That’s quite
something I think

EXT JJS FLATS DAY 77

existence of angels Or at least
Jess had

JJ climbs past an open window

GLADYS
Suicide again is it

JJ smiles charmingly

JI
Hello Gladys

GLADYS
Those press still about They do
make it difficult to buy a pint of
milk though

She shuts the window

He then reaches the end of the balcony and - and this bit is
a bit more tricky - in fact it’s more or less impossible
the gap to the next balcony over is a bit too wide JJ thinks
and then makes the leap

EXT STREET DAY 78

We cut to - JJ on a bike He checks behind him he does so
obsessively

He stops - at lights In front of a shop with a bank of TV

screens TV screens playing selected highlights of Jess’s TV

Jesss face He frowns The lights change He rides off fast

JJ (V0)
We even had questions asked about

MARTIN shoots JESS a look and then smiles at MAUREEN as JJ
passes through the boarding gate

MARTIN
I’m sure the break will be good for

MAUREEN
Dr Stephens said the same - he’s

MAUREEN
This

He takes it from her

AIRLINE STEWARD

out onto the balcony

it Us Being away together

JI

JJ looks at MARTIN who’s thinking carefully

MARTIN
I thought I knew what I was doing
with the press - and then -

JI
Then Jess got in the way

MARTIN
No then I realised I’d got it
wrong I thought that people would
like it That we’d make money and
people would find it eccentric -
and heart-warming

JT
Heart-warming

MARTIN
Four people Survive suicide Find
hope Blah blah blah That’s the
sort of good news story the press
love But I underestimated how much
they hate me

JJ frowns at MARTIN

JI
It wasn’t just about you

MARTIN
I fucked her Penny She was
probably still upset about that I
fucked her I fucked - I fucked -
everything And I can’t quite work
out - why

JJ says nothing MARTIN turns - vehement - to JJ

MARTIN (CONTD)
If she’d only been a hundred and
five days older

JT
Yeah

Then MARTIN’s face sinks He knows how stupid he sounds

MARTIN
And if I’d only been thirty fucking
years younger

Beat JJ looks at MARTIN

JT
Yeah

MARTIN looks at JJ Full of pain

MARTIN
You know I envy you your cancer
So cut and dried

JJ looks at MARTIN - genuinely conflicted as to whether to
tell the truth

JT
Yeah

MARTIN
No Really I’ve been so impressed
with you JJ

(MORE)

MARTIN (CONTD)
You barely let it affect you And
that - is something to drink to

He takes two small whiskeys from his dressing gown pocket -
he hands JJ one He opens his He raises it in the air

MARTIN (CONT’D)
Your health

MARTIN downs his whisky JJ doesn’t drink his

MARTIN (CONT’D)
Wow That’s quite a - hit Savagery
thy name is cheap hotel whisky

He takes a moment to recover He looks at JJ again

MARTIN (CONTD)
What are we doing here again

JI
The press The pact

MARTIN raises his bottle again He almost toasts the pact
And then thinks better of it

MARTIN
Do you know what I feel when I wake
up in the mornings Humiliated Do
you know what I feel at lunchtime
Humiliated My life is a constant
stream of humiliation I don’t feel
sad - that’s just - bullshit - and
I don’t feel angry - I just feel -
humiliated And every single
decision I take just makes it
worse

He raises his bottle

MARTIN (CONTD)
To humiliation

JJ still doesn’t drink MARTIN looks at him
MARTIN (CONTD)
Well We better get ready They’1ll
be waiting for us

He smiles at JJ

MARTIN (CONT’D)

INT TOWN SQUARE BAR NIGHT 89

table

MARTIN
OK God gives you three wishes

MAUREEN
God is not a tombola machine He
doesn’t give wishes

MARTIN
OK Um A cosmic - Martin - gives
you three wishes -

JESS
“Cosmic” - oh my God you’re
starting to sound like my Dad at a
family wedding

MARTIN
Three wishes Anything you want

JESS
OK Easy A billion pounds My own
personal hitman And a court waiver
over anything I choose to do

Everyone moves clockwise round to look at MAUREEN’s face
MAUREEN
Really Um I’d want a bit more -

help A bit more of a - life

JESS
What’s a bit more of a life

MAUREEN
Just what other peoplehave

JESS
What do other people have

MAUREEN looks at MARTIN - cutting JESS out

MAUREEN
And I’d wish my son all better
Which is why I don’t do wishes

There’s a pause As everyone considers the enormity of that

MARTIN
I’d want to be famous again The
right kind of famous

JJ looks at MARTIN and frowns

MARTIN (CONTD)
Being famous is great Everyone
says it’s difficult - but it’s not
Getting seats in restaurants
having people smile when you sit
next to them on the tube It’s
great And whatever you do - you
feel - vindicated - by your fame
and you never ever - feel
humiliated Well It’s certainly
better than real life anyway

JESS
Wow You’re deep

MARTIN
No I’m honest

JI
Martin

MARTIN
What You’re nothing if you’re not
noticed

JESS looks at MARTIN oddly
JESS
Fame or your kids which would you
choose

JT

You don’t mean that Martin
MARTIN

Don’t I
JT

This is a bad game

JJ looks again at KATHY JESS follows his gaze again her
eyes’s narrow

JESS
A bad game is it Maybe we should
guess what JJ’s reasons
areobviously he’d cure his
cancer for a start And then he’d
JJ looks at JESS like she’s the worst thing in the world

JT
I need the bathroom

JESS
And then he’d probably want a load
of money so he could donate it to
cancer research

JJ stands up from the table

JI
Other people are allowed to be in
pain you know that Jess

It’s brutally delivered JESS wobbles slightly JJ stands
firmed jawed Then ANGELO arrives

ANGELO
My English friends

And with that JJ walks off
JESS makes to follow him

have made everything more -
intense

KATHY stops She looks around

KATHY
And you don’t like intense

JJ realises the flirting’s stepped a gear
He breaks

JI
Not - yeah - I can’t talk I’m
intense

KATHY
Good Because if you’re looking for
a neurosis free girl you’re bang
out of luck

into a smile

JT
Yeah

KATHY
I once set fire to my own hair to
see what would happen I was 10 It
didn’t improve my look

JI
That’s nothing When I was a kid I
jumped off our roof to see if Id
hurt myself I broke my leg And I
quite liked it

KATHY grins wider - she likes this game

JJ laughs

KATHY
Well how’s this for psycho I
carved my ex boyfriends initials
into my left inner thigh as a way
of telling him no-one else will
ever see there I’ve still got the
scars Beat that

JI
Easy I recently told some people I
had cancer to avoid telling them
the real reason I had for
attempting suicide

KATHY stops She looks at JJ carefully

KATHY
That is intense

JJ realises he’s broken the mood slightly

KATHY (CONT’D)
What was the real reason you wanted
to

JT
I don’t - know All I do know is I
was part of a pact and I lied to
become a member Which

KATHY looks at him

KATHY
What pact

JJ thinks - does he want to talk about it No
JI
Just a bunch of desperate people
being desperate together as a way
of feeling less - desperate

Only took a credit card and a bit
of spit Hotel security is not what

desperate together as a way of
feeling less - desperate

She snuffles in bed beside him He presses stop He looks at

beautiful

something

He stops when exhausted Unsure what to do next

And the camera pulls back - on a confused guy in the middle
of a big lot of water

INT HOTEL BREAKFAST BUFFET DAY 99

MARTIN stands in the middle of the buffet breakfast He’s
clearly very hungover The breakfast is eat as much as you

fixated on a kid sticking his hand into a chocolate fountain
Every so often the kid removes his hand and licks it
Chocolate is going everywhere

MAUREEN (0S)
I think it’s sweet

MARTIN doesn’t turn to acknowledge MAUREEN

MARTIN
I think it’s unsanitary

MAUREEN
No Only part of you thinks that
the other part thinks it’s sweet

MARTIN looks at MAUREEN - surprised at her confidence

MAUREEN (CONTD)
Why are you waiting here

MARTIN
I’m waiting for them to finish that
tray of scrambled egg and bring in
a new tray I want the fresh stuff

MAUREEN
The scrambled egg is never fresh
Martin I may not have been on many
holidays before but I have been in
a lot of hospitals and I understand

MARTIN
Who are all these people And why
do they eat so much

They’re having a good time That’s
all

MARTIN thinks and then looks at them all MAUREEN smiles
softly at him She touches his arm

MAUREEN (CONTD)
Thank you for arranging this
holiday Martin I think it’s been
good for me

MARTIN turns to her surprised His eyes darken

MARTIN
You really don’t understand how
much of a disaster we all are do
you

MAUREEN looks at him smiles and then takes his plate from
him

MAUREEN
Come-on Let’s get you some
breakfast

INT HOTEL CORRIDOR DAY 100
JJ stands in the corridor of the hotel

He looks through some double doors He thinks He’s psyching
himself for something

He runs his hands through his hair He sits in one of the
hotel seats He thinks and then walks through the doors

INT HOTEL DINING ROOM DAY 101

JJ walks through the buffet bar and spots MARTIN MAUREEN and
JESS sitting together He takes a breath and then joins them

JESS looks at him and smiles softly

JESS
Hi
MARTIN follows JESS’s eyeline and notices JJ
MARTIN
Good morning JJ May have said some

stupid things last night Drink has
never been my friend

JJ stays standing
JI
Yeah So I’ve got a few things
to say And I’m not sure you’ll
like any of them
All three look up at him - surprised

MAUREEN
Are you going back to America

JJ takes a breath
JI
Ill start with the biggest I’ve
not got cancer of the brain I’ve
not got CCR

MAUREEN
They’ve cured you

JJ turns and looks at MAUREEN bravely

JI
I never had it I made it up

Beat

JJ (CONTD)
There’s not even any such thing as
CCR Just - Creedence Clearwater
Revival are one of my favourite
bands

MAUREEN
Oh

They’re beyond shocked JJ looks at JESS

JESS
I wasn’t going to tell them

MARTIN
You knew about this

MAUREEN
I thought there was - something
strange about -

MARTIN
So why were you - up there - JJ

JJ hesitates

JESS
He can’t answer that It’s
personal

MAUREEN

I’m sure he had good reasons

MARTIN
Did he JJ - did you

JJ notices KATHY approach across the restaurant This is the
wrong timing MARTIN stands and approaches JJ

JI
Guys We’re going to need to
postpone this conversation for
another time

MARTIN
We made a pact - I - trusted you -
I liked you
JJ looks at KATHY almost at the table
JT
Please Martin Sit down We’1ll do

this another time

MARTIN
Another time What time

KATHY thinks whether to kiss JJ but decides better not

KATHY
Where were you I woke up you’d
gone

MARTIN

Oh right so we all stop for your
girlfriend do we

JJ looks at MARTIN He doesn’t want to say this

JT
Martin She’s not my girlfriend
she’s a journalist

There is an anguished pause KATHY realises she’s rumbled

MARTIN
She’s - what

JT
I didn’t know

KATHY
Shit This is

MARTIN
You don’t seem to know much do you

JT
Martin Please This is all wrong

MARTIN’s face grows horribly cold

MARTIN
It is - all - wrong isn’t it

MAUREEN
If he didn’t know he didn’t know
We’ve had bad things written about
us before - we’ll have -

JI
I understand you being angry but
please MartinI’m feeling pretty
humiliated here

MARTIN
You don’t understand anything You
certainly don’t understand
humiliation

MAUREEN
Martin You’re being dramatic

MARTIN pushes JJ against a table Full up with anger

MARTIN
Youre a fraud JJ A leach

JJ pushes MARTIN back

JT
I’m not a fraud

KATHY
John This is not what

JESS
Who the fuck is John

JJ looks at JESS

JI
I’m John

MARTIN
You didn’t even tell us your real
name

MARTIN pushes JJ again

MAUREEN
Martin Stop this Remember the
pact

JESS

Oh fuck the pact

She swings and hits KATHY Who isn’t expecting it and drops
like a stone

KATHY
My nose

JJ turns to look at this just as MARTIN punches and connects
with JJs ear

JESS fights with KATHY and MARTIN fights with JJ And it’s
not good but it’s not farcical It’s more reckless than
that

We close on MAUREEN - watching - this is hell

INT TRAVELATOR DAY 102

We watch as our four glide past us on the travelator MAUREEN
has no noticeable physical damage MARTIN has a blackening
left eye JJ a blackening right but it’s JESS that licks the
plate clean - with two eyes firmly black

No-one is looking at each other In fact no-one is looking
at much at all They’re all thoroughly consumed by what a
mess this has been

CU FEET DAY 103

Two feet dangle and then have tights pulled over them and
then they’re placed in shoes

CU SHOES DAY 104

The feet - now in their sensible shoe sheaf - shift from one
side to the other

MAUREEN carefully puts MATTY into a hoist She hoists him out
of bed he dangles in the air and she carefully guides him

glimmers of light

MAUREEN (VO)
Not having Matty with me on the
holiday - it felt like I was
missing a leg Strange Light

INT MAUREEN’S HOUSE KITCHEN DAY 106

MAUREEN carefully attaches a nozzle onto a feeding tube in
MATTY’s lower stomach Then she turns on a machine which
begins to pump food through the tube

MAUREEN (VO)
That’s probably not like missing a
leg at all I don’t imagine most
people’s first impressions of leg
loss is weightlessness

INT MAUREEN’S HOUSE LIVING ROOM DAY 107

MAUREEN and MATTY are watching TV It’s full of colour and
quite frenetic Neither of them are

descent I thought I was going to
die

MAUREEN (VO)
And I hadnt said goodbye

INT MAUREEN’S HOUSE BEDROOM DAY 109

MAUREEN stands in front of the mirror She tucks in her
tummy Looks worried at the reflection Checks her hair
Despairs of her hair

MAUREEN (VO)
JJs girlfriends’ piece meant the
story - our story - didn’t die -
and so the press still followed me -
but I concentrated on being boring
like Martin said Not difficult

EXT MAUREEN’S HOUSE DAY 110
MAUREEN leaves the house carefully pushing MATTY

MAUREEN (VO)
And as for the others As soon as
we landed - we scattered in
different directions like we were -
allergic - to each other The pact
was broken beyond repair and
without the pact - our friendship
was broken too

INT CHURCH DAY 111

MAUREEN pushing MATTY’s chair into the Church She carefully
lights a candle She notices JESS dodging behind a pillar

I still saw them - patchily - every
now and again I saw Jess in places
she shouldn’t be

EXT STREET DAY 112

find JJ - just to check he was OK

EXT STREET DAY 113

I never saw Martin

INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR DAY 114

MAUREEN pushes MATTY down a corridor There is patient art on
the walls

MAUREEN (VO)
No Mostly I got on with my life
and hoped they got on with theirs

She stops by a notice board On the board is a poster with
detachable segments on the bottom It says ‘Do you have the
answers Join The Patient-Staff Quiz Team’

MAUREEN looks at it for slightly longer than is necessary

INT HOSPITAL THERAPY POOL DAY 115

MAUREEN stands with MATTY in front of her at the poolside
There is a younger child with Cerebral Palsy in the pool
being carefully led through exercises

DR STEPHENS
Matty did great We did some
interesting reflex work

MAUREEN looks at MATTY and smiles

MAUREEN
Nice to have him properly looked
after for once

DR STEPHENS
-He reacted well to company

MAUREEN
I’m sure he loved a change from my
blathering

MAUREEN is unpicking everything

DR STEPHENS
And we couldn’t get him out of
this pool

MAUREEN
He’s always liked water No pool at
my house

DR STEPHENS looks up at her and frowns desperate to
contradict her but he can’t think how

DR STEPHENS
WellI was very pleased to have
the opportunity to spend some time
with him

MAUREEN
I think the pleasure was all his

DR STEPHENS
There might be a slot for him to
come to my weekly sessions if youd
like it

MAUREEN
I’m sure he’d love it

DR STEPHENS
I’1l add him to the list

DR STEPHENS has exhausted all he has to say They sit in
silence for a beat too long

DR STEPHENS (CONTD)
You look like you caught a bit of
colour

MAUREEN blushes

MAUREEN
Did I Oh

DR STEPHENS
You enjoyed yourself

MAUREEN considers this and looks up with a smile

MAUREEN
Yes I did

DR STEPHENS
From the pictures in the papers it
seemed you picked a very nice
location
MAUREEN blushes and smiles at DR STEPHENS

MAUREEN
YesWell I won’t keep you

She stands and bustles and begins to sort MATTY out Then
turns worried she’s been rude

MAUREEN (CONTD)
Thank you for your help Dr
Stephens We’re very grateful
EXT STREET DAY 116

MAUREEN pushes MATTY along the street

A kid stops and stares at MATTY The kid’s mother pulls him
away

MOTHER
Sorry

MAUREEN
Oh No No

MAUREEN walks on She stops and traffic lights and presses
the ‘wait’ button

The green man starts flashing She just stands there We
watch the green man slowly flick off
117 INT MATTY’S BEDROOM NIGHT 117

MAUREEN is giving MATTY a gentle bed bath carefully dealing
with the difficulties of his limbs

MATTY keeps knocking the water Splashing her

MAUREEN
What is it

MATTY splashes again

MAUREEN (CONT’D)
Matty

MATTY knocks the water again She’s splashed again
Then the doorbell rings again And MATTY gives up exhausted

MAUREEN (CONT’D)
Matty

Then the doorbell rings again and MAUREEN puts down the
water And beginning to rub MATTY quickly dry
118 INT HALLWAY NIGHT 118

MAUREEN answers the door She doesn’t know the person on the
other side

CINDY
Hi

MAUREEN
Hi

CINDY

You’re wet
MAUREEN looks down at herself and realises she is
CINDY (CONTD)

Sorry to have called so late - it
was an impulsive decision to visit

MAUREEN
Right Who - are you

CINDY barks a nervous laugh

CINDY
I’m Cindy Martin’s wifeEx-wife

MAUREEN looks at her a moment digesting
MAUREEN

You better come in

INT MAUREEN’S LIVING ROOM NIGHT

CINDY tries to think where to sit she can’t decide she

waits for MAUREEN to sit first MAUREEN doesn’t sit

MAUREEN
Do you want a cup of tea

CINDY
No No I’m fine

MAUREEN sits uncomfortably CINDY picks up a photo from
beside her chair

CINDY (CONT’D)
This your son I’ve read about

MAUREEN
Yes Matty

CINDY
Looks like a nice boy

MAUREEN nods CINDY looks at MAUREEN carefully

CINDY (CONTD)
I haven’t heard from him in weeks
Every time I ring he puts the phone
down And I need to know he’s OK
When Martin falls off a cliff he
really - falls off a cliff

MAUREEN is hugely uncomfortable
MAUREEN
Oh That’s why you - I’m sorry I
haven’t seen him - since we came
back from holiday
CINDY digests this

CINDY
What’s he - told you about me

MAUREEN
Not much He’s a very private man

CINDY
He’s not private He’s secretive
There’s a difference

This comes out more aggressively than CINDY intends MAUREEN
retracts her neck slightly

CINDY (CONT’D)
Has he told you I won’t let him see
his kids

MAUREEN
He did say that

CINDY is pulled tighter than a guitar string

CINDY
Of course he can see his kids He
just doesn’t want to

MAUREEN turns and looks at her - shocked

MAUREEN
What

CINDY
You know I’ve very good reasons to
be angry with him soI don’t know
why I always have to be the one
trying to mend Sorry Sorry I
promised myself I wouldn’t do this

MAUREEN looks at her CINDY is crying slightly

CINDY (CONTD)
My kids need their Dad And I need
to know he’s OK

MAUREEN offers CINDY a tissue CINDY takes one

MAUREEN
Better take two - they’re the
supermarket value kind They mush
when exposed to water

CINDY laughs despite herself and then takes two Then turns
and looks at MAUREEN cautiously

CINDY
Why were you up there On the -
roof

It’s a stark question MAUREEN thinks about asking for
clarification But she doesn’t

MAUREEN
Without me social services would
pay for Matty’s care The standards
they He wouldn’t have to have me
getting everything - (wrong)

CINDY
You think he’d be better off
without his mother

MAUREEN
Not his mother This mother

CINDY tries to think how to rationalize this she can’t She
stands up

CINDY
This was a bad idea Wasn’t it Me
Coming here

MAUREEN
Was it

CINDY
I wanted you to tell me someone was
looking after him I hoped you
were But why would I expect you to
help You were up there too

CINDY begins to exit then stops She turns - she looks at
MAUREEN a moment

CINDY (CONT’D)
Thanks for the tea

She exits MAUREEN is left alone
MAUREEN
I didn’t make you tea
120 INT MATTY’S BEDROOM NIGHT 120
MAUREEN is dressing MATTY in his pyjamas
She unknots his arm to get a pyjama top on to him
He doesn’t resist He doesn’t make a noise
She forces the top on to him It’s not an easy business
MAUREEN
Sometimes I think you’re saying
something to me Then I realize you

can’t

She sits back

MAUREEN (CONTD)
Maybe I’1l1 just sit here a bit
INT MATTY’S BEDROOM NIGHT 121

MAUREEN wakes sitting in exactly the same seat She clearly
fell asleep there

MATTY is asleep on the bed She reaches out as if to touch
him but changes her mind

She stands She is slightly unsteady on her feet

She walks to the door

She exits

And then she re-enters at speed

She checks MATTY’s breathing Then she checks it again
MAUREEN

She puts an oxygen mask on him she begins to administer CPR

A lady who we haven’t seen much action from at all is

suddenly all action She opens a phone with her mouth She

dials 999

INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR NIGHT 122

MATTY is pushed along a corridor NURSES and DOCTORS

administer what they can as he moves MAUREEN runs beside

them totally at a loss

INT SURGERY NIGHT 123

MAUREEN stands lost desperate and limp as surgeons

administer on her son Outside the window snow begins to

fall

A NURSE guides her out

INT WAITING ROOM DAY 124

MAUREEN sits on the chairs It’s early morning Around her
life lives

Maybe it speeds by Maybe we watch people being wheeled in on
gurneys and people shouting at vending machines And drunks
coming in and out It’s clearly snowing outside many look
snowed on and a familiar sludge forms in the entrance way

MAUREEN stands and walks slowly through them to the phones
She begins to dial

And priests sit beside her and breast-feeding Mums and kids
with angry faces

And then MARTIN enters looking flustered He has fresh snow
on him

MARTIN
I came as quickly as I could

MAUREEN looks at him - glassy eyed Emotionless He hugs her
And it feels odd because these two lonely people are not used
to hugging - the hugging is pain and emotion all at once -
they both sort of sink into it

And then JESS and CHRIS enter and just - watch the hug
slightly uncomfortably They too have snow on them

MAUREEN looks at JESS - and breaks from MARTIN - slightly
astonished

MAUREEN
You came too

JESS
Nothing on the TV This is my Dad
He drove me He’1ll probably say
something moving about loss now

Everyone looks at CHRIS expectantly

CHRIS
I’m sorry to hear about your son
Maureen

JESS

Not one of his better attempts
MAUREEN

I’m really pleased - I’m really -

grateful - you’re all - here

JESS looks at MAUREEN - steadily

JESS
Fuck off Of course we’re here

INT WAITING ROOM DAY 125
Time has passed MARTIN and CHRIS sit together MAUREEN
slightly apart JESS enters with a tray of hot chocolates

which she distributes

MARTIN
This isn’t tea
JESS
I know It’s hot chocolate

MARTIN
I asked for tea

JESS
Yes But I was buying And I don’t
like the smell of tea

MARTIN
So when you buy rounds in pubs

JESS
Ya-huh Everyone gets pink gins
And then I never have to buy a
round ever again Clever right

MARTIN smiles She looks around the room

JESS (CONTD)
Is Double J still not here

MAUREEN
I didn’t get through to him He’s
probably not picked up his
messages

JESS
Either that or he doesn’t care One
or the other

MARTIN looks at CHRIS
MARTIN
I genuinely don’t know how you’ve

survived her

CHRIS
Ear plugs

JESS
I’m going to make you go and sit in
the car in a minute

CHRIS
Ear plugs and Pink Gin

MARTIN looks at CHRIS and softly smiles
MAUREEN
He wasn’t the reason I was up
there Matty He wasn’t
The tone suddenly shifts

MARTIN
No

MAUREEN looks at them all wildly

MAUREEN
There were lots of reasons why I
was up on that roof You once asked
me why Jess and I said I felt
helpless But the truth is I
hadnt done a list for living and a
list for It was a feeling not
a thought But not one of those
reasons - was that I didnt love my
son Not one of them Not one

JESS
Maureen We know that

For once in her life JESS has been sincere And it’s nice

And then DR STEPHENS appears at the end of the waiting room
and walks slowly towards them

But only MAUREEN notices And then everyone notices

DR STEPHENS makes eye contact with MAUREEN - she assumes the
worst

MAUREEN
Oh no Oh no No Don’t tell me

DR STEPHENS
No No He’s fine Maureen
Maureen He’s fine

MAUREEN looks up at DR STEPHENS

MAUREEN
What

DR STEPHENS
Were going to keep monitoring him
but he’s no longer critical He’ll
be fine

MARTIN
He’ll be fine

DR STEPHENS
Hell be fine

MAUREEN looks at him and her face feels upside down she’s
not sure how to look

DR STEPHENS (CONT’D)
Would you like to come see him

INT INTENSIVE CARE DAY 126
MATTY is lying with lots of tubes sticking out of him

MAUREEN and DR STEPHENS stand at the front JESS and MARTIN
behind CHRIS behind them

DR STEPHENS
The tubes look worse than they are
We’1ll remove some tonight The rest
will hopefully be out tomorrow

MAUREEN
I should have seen it sooner If
he’d had proper care If he’d had
proper care

DR STEPHENS smiles

DR STEPHENS
Maureen You saved him

He looks at her She sits beside MATTY he thinks about
leaving but decides to stay

DR STEPHENS (CONT’D)
It was a myocardial infarction He
had a heart attack Of sorts His
symptoms were almost invisible I
didn’t notice it I was monitoring
it and didn’t But you caught it
You saved his life

He stops talking MAUREEN is gently - quietly - singing to
MATTY without even realising it

She realises she’s singing and stops Immediately
Embarrassed She looks up at DR STEPHENS who smiles gently
back

DR STEPHENS (CONTD)
It’s lovely the way you look at
your son

MAUREEN looks up at him - what does that mean DR STEPHENS
ploughs on

DR STEPHENS (CONT’D)
He’s calmer when you’re around You
make him - calmer He seems to - he
always knows you’re there Matty is
a very lucky boy to have you

CHRIS takes JESS’s hand JESS lets him

MAUREEN doesn’t know how to take this at all MAUREEN turns
and looks at DR STEPHENS

MAUREEN
I only had one thought - when he -
if he dies I die

DR STEPHENS looks her straight

DR STEPHENS
Well He lived

DR STEPHENS makes to exit and then stops

DR STEPHENS (CONT’D)
And maybe he feels the same way
about you as you do about him have
you ever considered that

MAUREEN doesn’t move DR STEPHENS exits He nods at MARTIN as
he does
DR STEPHENS (CONTD)
Make sure you don’t crowd him
He’ll need lots of rest
MARTIN nods DR STEPHEN’s exits
MAUREEN stares intently at her son
MAUREEN
Are you calmer when I’m here - are
you calmer
JESS looks at MARTIN a tear rolls down her cheek
INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR DAY 127

MARTIN CHRIS and JESS stand in the corridor gathering
themselves

MARTIN
Well that was

JESS
Yeah

Then a porter comes past pushing a ‘Happy Valentine’s Day’
decorated trolley

JESS (CONTD)
It’s Valentine’s Day

PORTER
No-one send you a card Pretty girl
like youshame

JESS‘’s brain churns through all the possibilities

JESS
It’s Valentines Day Martin It’s
Valentines Day

MARTIN turns and looks at her It’s not registering
JESS (CONTD)
God breakfast TV really mushed
your brain didn’t it

MARTIN’s face drops

MARTIN
The pact

JESS
Get Maureen We need to find JJ
Now

128 INT CHRIS’S CAR DAY 128
JESS sits intently staring through the screen They’re

driving fast through the sludge and the snow of a cold winter
day CHRIS looks at her

CHRIS
The things Maureen said about her
son

JESS

No time for an emotional now Dad
Things to do People to save

But CHRIS is emotional

CHRIS
I’m going to try harder Jess I’m
going to try harder OK

JESS says nothing CHRIS looks at her again

CHRIS (CONTD)
There was something in an article I
read recently - about a man who
survived jumping off the Golden
Gate Bridge He said that two
seconds after jumping he realized
there was nothing in life he
couldn’t solve - apart from the
problem he’d just given himself by
jumping off the bridge

He looks at JESS
CHRIS (CONT’D)

Do you think - do you understand
that - does that make sense to you

JESS says nothing And then turns to her Dad

JESS
Yeah It could make sense

A tear leaks down JESS’s face

JESS (CONTD)
Didn’t you think - With my face
in the front of the paper That
she’d see it and come home

CHRIS’s face suddenly is filled with pain He battles hard to
keep this emotion from his youngest daughter

CHRIS
Maybe she’s dead Maybe she just
had enough of us Maybe she - I
don’t know - maybe we need to
concentrate on ourselves for a bit

He parks up outside Paulo’s Pizzas

CHRIS (CONT’D)
Well We’re here

JESS looks at the door and then back at her Dad She kisses
him on the side of the cheek and then exits at speed

129 INT PAULO’S PIZZAS DAY 129
JESS races in ahead of CHRIS She looks at the faces PAULO

big and hairy is preparing an order - shoveling tomato onto
pizza bases

JESS
JJ Were here for JJ
PAULO
JJ He’s gone
JESS
Gone Shit
PAULO

Prick left a week ago Didn’t even
serve notice

CHRIS looks at PAULO He puffs up
CHRIS
The “prick” is my daughter’s friend
Paulo And you’1l do well to
recognise that fact

JESS grins despite her worry Then CHRIS loses his nerve

CHRIS (CONT’D)
You are called Paulo right

PAULO approaches them both and CHRIS really loses his nerve

CHRIS (CONTD)
It’s just the place is called
Paulo’s Pizzas andyou certainly
sound Italian and look
Italiannot that there’s an
Italian ‘look’ You’re quite
scary close up

JESS
Come on Dad

They race out together

130 INT OUTSIDE JJ’S FLAT DAY 130
GLADYS walks puffily up the stairs MAUREEN follows her

GLADYS
I’m not supposed to

MAUREEN
I’ve been in the paper with him

GLADYS
I know you have love

MAUREEN
Then you know we know each other
Trust me

GLADYS
Such a nice boy

GLADYS thinks and then opens the door

131 INT JJS FLAT DAY 131
The place is in a total mess MAUREEN looks at it Aghast

GLADYS
Oh my

Along one wall is a series of newspaper cuttings They have
headlines like ‘No Angels here’ They are of other suicides
from Toppers They present a very bleak picture We close on
MAUREEN’s eyes as she takes it all in

INT TOPPERS TOWER STAIRCASE DAY 132

MARTIN walks up the stairs He quickly gets out of breath
But he forces himself on

INT TOPPERS TOWER TOP OF STAIRCASE DAY 133

The door is bolted This time with heavier locks And a sign
saying ‘Access Prohibited’ And this time MARTIN doesn’t have
a bolt cutter

MARTIN
Fuck

He kicks at the door The door swings open The bolt has
already been got at Again

MARTIN looks through the door And only then does he realise
walking back out on that roof is one of the hardest things
he’1ll ever do

EXT ROOFTOP DAY 134

MARTIN walks onto the roof With bravery we haven’t seen in
him before He looks around the snow filled rooftop Flakes
still joining it from all sides In fact up here it’s a bit
of a blizzard

Through the white MARTIN sees someone standing on the edge
of the roof He’s heart broken

MARTIN
I hoped you wouldn’t be up here

JJ doesn’t turn around

JI
You know three people have killed
themselves off this building
between New Year and today Sue
Chalmott housewife and manic
depressive David Frommet a banker
whod lost everything and Ben
Peterson he was only 15 I cut out
bits on them in the local paper

MARTIN
So youre going to - join them

JI
I kept to the pact This - me -
it’s none of your business now

MARTIN
True

MARTIN thinks

MARTIN (CONT’D)
One question though - why

JJ thinks - and then thinks again - and then turns and looks
at MARTIN still on the edge of the building

JI
That’s the thing I didn’t lie to
you - I don’t know

MARTIN
You - don’t know

JI
Yeah I don’t - know And that’s
why my reason is better than any of
yours

MARTIN
Better I wasn’t aware it was a
competition

MARTIN starts to walk towards JJ

JI
Jess - she just needs to feel
important Maureen - she needs to
feel loved You need to grow a
brain

MARTIN
That’s not - fair

JI
But meI’m Dorothy so how do I
get better What cures me You can
solve your problems Me I can’t

MARTIN keeps walking

JJ (CONTD)
Martin - stop walking You stop
walking right now Otherwise I’1ll
start walking OK Three steps
backwards And I’m - gone

MARTIN stops walking

MAUREEN comes through the rooftop door and makes to speak
She sees the scene and doesn’t JJ doesn’t see her

JJ (CONTD)
I’m bored of being scared all the
time and not knowing why Bored of
trying to change - and not knowing
how

(MORE)

JJ (CONTD)
Leaving my latest shit band moving
countries - because however much I
do change I’m left with - me

MARTIN
Sounds like you’ve got it all
worked out JJ It’s logical The
reason why you don’t want to die is
because you don’t want to live
anymore it’s quite simple right

JJ says nothing

MARTIN (CONTD)
Yeah I used to think like that
too

JESS suddenly bursts through the roof doors

JESS
TT eee

MARTIN turns and silences her with a look

MARTIN
And then there were four

JJ looks at JESS he really didn’t want her here

JI
Don’t you get it - we’ve got to
Valentine’s Day and nothing -
absolutely nothing - has changed

MARTIN
But - everything - has changed

JESS
Were standing in entirely
different positions for one thing

JJ wobbles He looks at JESS He wobbles

MARTIN
And the rest of us - the other
three up on this roof - we’re not
here because we want to die - we’re
here for you

He looks around the rooftop

MARTIN (CONT’D)

I didn’t want to be up here ever
again JJ I’m pretty sure none of
us did

JESS
He’s right It is shit up here

MARTIN
But I am here - we are here Now
For you And I’m pretty sure - if
you thought about it - you’d do the
same for mefor any of us

MARTIN digests his own words JJ says nothing

MARTIN (CONTD)
The Topper House Four We belong
together We’re a team We’re the
worst team the world has ever known
and if I’d have been picking none
of you would have even made the
subs bench but still we’re a team

JJ looks back at the edge of the tower
We look at the edge of the tower
It’s a long way down And it’s very very white

He turns - he looks back at MARTIN JESS and MAUREEN MARTIN
speaks softly to him

MARTIN (CONT’D)
Not much I know son But - maybe
were a start

JJ opens his mouth considering carefully what to say He
clears his throat

JT
You can’t even see to the bottom

We look down again into the white

EXT CAR PARK DAY 135

MARTIN parks up his car And lets his kids - MAISIE and POLLY
out of the back POLLY is carrying a doll They run excitedly
towards the park MARTIN follows There is evidence of spring
on the trees

MARTIN
Maisie don’t run Maisie

MAISIE does run She falls - she scrapes her knee
MARTIN (CONT’D)
Don’t cry Don’t cry You’ve just

learnt a valuable lesson

MAISIE does cry MARTIN helps her clean up her knee

MARTIN (VO)

It’s hard not to consider the

notion that I didn’t mean it The
suicide That none of us meant it
But I did - mean it I know I did -
I scored very highly on Aaron T
Beck’s Suicide Intent Scale Twenty-
one out of thirty points

136 EXT PARK DAY 136

MARTIN with MAISIE on his shoulders and POLLY holding hands
beside him walks through a park POLLY is talking excitedly

POLLY
And then we saw a penguin and Mum
said that the penguin is - a nice
animal and I said it didn’t look
nice

MARTIN (VO)

Yes suicide had been contemplated
more than three hours prior to
death yes I -- was certain of
death even if I received medical
attention It’s fifteen storeys
high Toppers Yes there was
preparation for the attempt
ladder bolt cutters cigar It’s
just these - people - showed up
And I - well I

He approaches a picnic rug On it is JESS MAUREEN and - yes -
JJ

They look pleased to see him They’re mid conversation
JESS
Brilliant I bet Martin will be
good at this
JI
(to MARTIN)
Don’t even join in
MAUREEN looks at a child who’s approached her
MAUREEN
Now - are you Maisie or Polly And

would you like a toffee

MARTIN
What will I be good at

He sits down

JESS
Consider this Sitting around
here Are other people whove -
without doubt - contemplated
suicide

MARTIN turns to his daughters

MARTIN
Run off and play

POLLY
But Dad -

MARTIN
Now

MARTIN (CONT’D)
Thanks Jess

JT
(to MARTIN)
Don’t engage Never engage

JJ grins and takes some pills out of his pocket

JESS
Oh JJs getting upset He’s taking
his mad pills

JI
Anti-depressants

MAUREEN
I’ve bought a thermos Martin Would
you like some coffee

JESS
It’s true Statistically at least
one person on this hill will at
some point in his or her life kill
themselvesMaureen told us it
was in her quiz book

MAUREEN blushes
MAUREEN
I’ve joined a team Just a - small

thing

This matters to MAUREEN but no-one else really registers this
fact

MARTIN
So

JESS
So - who would you pick
JJ laughs
JI
Oh that’s where you were going
with it
MARTIN
Who would I pick
JESS
To die
MARTIN

Who would I pick to die

MAUREEN
Yes It’s not a hard question I
think that lady

MAUREEN points out someone walking her dog The lady notices
and frowns Everyone looks at her - shocked A drop of rain
falls from the sky

MARTIN
Maureen

JESS
Maureen I love you

JI
She’s looking Put your hand down

MAUREEN
What She doesn’t know what I’m
saying I could be saying who’s got
the nicest bottom It could be a
compliment

JESS is delighted She indicates More rain falls
JESS
And I say that man - that man in
the khaki shorts Martin Your
turn

The man turns and looks at them

JI
OK Now everyone’s looking

MARTIN
I’m not picking

MAUREEN
Martin it’s just a game

JT
Maureen I’m shocked

JESS
Isnt it brilliant I’ve ruined
her

MAUREEN
If you’re shocked by that John
Julius - I can do considerably
worse - I’ve remembered my joke
about Vaseline

It suddenly starts raining quite heavily They start to
gather their things

JESS
Shit

JT
Fuck

MARTIN

The clouds part Maybe God hates
you after all Maureen

Everyone laughs as they put the ground sheet over their heads
and run for cover gathering Martin’s children as they do

MARTIN (VO)
Yes there was logic in what I
wanted to do I wanted to say
goodbye to a semi-functioning
digestive system a criminal
record a wife who hated me a job
I was shit at and a more than
healthy dose of self disgust - I
wanted to say goodbye to a life
mislaid No Not mislaid That
implies accidental damage I hadn’t
mislaid my life I’dspent it

Everyone scatters from the hill top And then MARTIN runs
back up - alone - to collect the doll Polly left behind

MARTIN (VO)
But now if it doesn’t make me
sound like a dickhead I’m going to
earn it back

JESS (V0)
It does make you sound a bit like a
dickhead

MARTIN (VO)
Thanks Jess
