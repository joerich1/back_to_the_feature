be this mat that you would put on the floor and it would have
different

conclusions written on it that you couldjump to

Our high school guidance counselor used to ask us what you would do if
we had a million dollars and didnt have to work And invariably
whatever we would say that was supposed to be our careers If you
wanted to build cars then youre supposed to be an auto mechanic

SAMIR
So what did you say

PETER
I never had an answer I guess thats why Im working at Initech

MICHAEL

No youre working at Initech because that question is bullshit to
begin with

(The printer is not working)

If that quiz worked there would be no janitors because no one would
clean shit up if they had a million dollars

SAMIR
Well I would invest half of it in Mutual Funds and give the rest
of it to my friend Saheib in Securities

want to do And then

There comes a place in a mans life and uh maybe that time for you
is

now when it doesnt hurt to think about the future

MICHAEL

Uh no offense there Peter but think about yourself sport Youre
the one whos been flaking out at work Whatever that religious
experience or whatever the hell it was you better snap out of it or
youre gonna get canned

PETER

Yeah I I IListen that virus youre always talking about The
one

that that could rip off the company for a bunch of money

MICHAEL
Yeah What about it

PETER
Well how does it work

MICHAEL

Its pretty brilliant What it does is where theres a bank
transaction and the interests are computed in the thousands a day in
fractions of a cent which it usually rounds off What this does is it
takes those remainders and puts it into your account

PETER
This sounds familiar

MICHAEL
Yeah They did this in Superman III
PETER
Yeah What a good movie

MICHAEL
A bunch of hackers did this in the 70s and one of them got busted

PETER
Well so they check for this now

MICHAEL
No you see Initechs so backed up with all the software were
updating for the year 2000 theyd never notice

PETER
Youre right And even if they wanted to they could never check all
that code

MICHAEL
Its numbers up their asses

PETER
So Michael whats to keep you from doing this

MICHAEL
Its not worth the risk I got a good job

PETER
What if you didnt have a good job

MICHAEL
Cockos Samir and I are the best programmers in that place And you
you havent even been showing up and you get to keep your job

PETER

Yeah I know Michael Its completely unfair And I realized
something

today Its not about me and my dream of doing nothing Its about all
of us together I dont know what happened at that hypnotherapist the
other day maybe it was just shock Its wearing off now but when I
saw that fat man keel over and die Michael I realized that we dont
have a lot of time on this earth We werent meant to spend it this
way Human beings werent meant to sit in little cubicles starring at
computer screens all day filling out useless forms and listening to
eight different bosses drone on about mission statements

MICHAEL
I told those fudge-packers that I like Michael Boltons music God

PETER

that is not right Michael For five years now youve worked your ass
off at Initech hoping for a promotion or some kind of profit sharing
or something Five years of your mid-20s now gone And youre gonna
go

in tomorrow and theyre gonna throw you out into the street You know
why So Bill Lumberghs stock will go up a quarter of a point
Michael

lets make that stock go down Lets take enough money from that place
that we never ever have to sit in a cubicle ever again Your software
works right

MICHAEL

Of course it works Thats not the point Look even if it could work
I dont know how to install it I dont know the credit union software
loan

PETER
Yeah But Samir does

Scene Peters apartment Samirs there along with Michael and
Peter
