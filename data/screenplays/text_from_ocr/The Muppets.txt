THE HUGE TITLE BEGINS TO FALL OVER and like an editing wipe
as it falls it takes us to

EXT VENICE BOARDWALK - DAY
TITLE UP THE FOLLOWING IS BASED ON A TRUE STORY

GARY STEVENS performs for a large crowd on the beachside
strip Other nearby performers PAINTED ROBOT GUY PSYCHIC
CAT GUY etc watch on enviously as the audience cheers Gary

Ne He expertly operates his somewhat nondescript very simple
but CRUDELY BEAUTIFUL hand puppet WALTER singing a duet
with “himself”

GARY

WALTER
Oh yes were friends

GARY
And nothing

WALTER
No sir nothing

Gary begins to drink a big glass of water To the crowd’s
amazement “Walter” continues singing perfectly

WALTER (CONTD)

nothing no nothingcan ever tear
us apaaaaaaa --

During this long note Gary finishes the water chews an
entire pack of gum and blows bubbles takes a bite of
burrito takes some mouthwash and gargles Then he spits out
the mouthwash joins back in the song and AMAZINGLY Walter
and Gary harmonize the final line

WALTERGARY
-- aaaartllll

The crowd erupts in applause WE NOTICE ONE MAN IN PARTICULAR
WATCHING WITH INTEREST He is dressed in terrible “vacation
clothes” short shorts Hawaiian shirt and a large brimmed
‘hat He subtly makes a note on a pad as the crowd cheers
Gary takes a bow and then makes Walter bow as well People
throw money into Gary’s bucket It’s not riches but it’s
rent As the crowd disperses Gary’s girlfriend Mary
approaches him She’s surrounded by her third grade class
They peck on the lips

GARY
Hey Mary

MARY

QUICK CUTS OF WALTER SNEAKING TO THE MUPPET STUDIOS

-- Walter sneaks up to a bus stop and sees a man with a gym
bag waiting at the stop He very quietly tiptoes up and
slides into the bag

-- The bus comes to a stop A diverse group of people exit
the bus and as they disperse we see Walter emerge and sneak
down the street

EXT HENSON STUDIOS LA BREA - LATER

Walter approaches the studios and sees the giant sculpture of
KERMIT THE FROG He stops and takes it in overwhelmed He
then sees the security guard at the front gate Walter sees
a puddle and gets an idea He jumps in the puddle and gets
himself wet A TRUCK PASSES and he JUMPS and STICKS to the
side of the truck like a wet towel

EXT HENSON STUDIOS COURTYARD - MOMENTS LATER
The truck DRIVES INTO the studio Walter FALLS OFF the side
of the truck He lays there for a second in pain then dusts

himself off and rises He takes in his surroundings

WALTER
I’m int

A SECURITY CART COMES DRIVING BY and Walter immediately goes
limp and falls to the ground pretending to be inanimate

The cart drives right by him He stands again and begins
creeping around the lot like a cat burglar

WALTER (CONT’D)
To the storage room

He sees two security guards heading his way He goes limp and
falls to the ground but this time the guards stop One
picks him up and examines the lifeless puppet

SECURITY GUARD 1
What do we have here

SECURITY GUARD 2
Looks like a prairie dog

SECURITY GUARD 1
Brown bird without wings We
should throw it in the storage room
with the rest of the unfinished
puppets

Walter opens and eye and smiles and then goes limp again

INT STORAGE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Walter lands with a thud as the guards toss him into the
storage room He tries not to make any noise on impact but
it hurts When the guards have left he gets up and dusts
himself off He looks around and finds the HALF FINISHED
ELEMENTS OF PUPPETS SURROUNDING HIM It is just creepy enough
to make kids scared Walter takes it all in

WALTER
Whoa Creepy

He examines the torso of a half finished Muppet with a
mixture of awe and fear SUDDENLY the door opens WALTER
GOES LIMP In walk STATLER and WALDORF who are giving a tour
to a man ina suit and a cowboy hat This is TEX RICHMAN and
for now he seems nice enough We may also notice that he
looks a good deal like VACATION MAN just in a different
outfit with slightly different hair and nose Walter
pretends he’s inanimate and eavesdrops on their conversation

STATLER
This is the storage room

WALDORF
Otherwise known as the dump

The two share a trademark chuckle

e

TEX
I’ve loved the Muppets since I was
just a boy And what better way
sirs to honor the Muppets than to
make this beautiful studio a Muppet
museum A shrine if you will I
think I‘11 call this room -- The
Kermit Room

STATLER
We don’t care what you call it

WALDORF
As long as the check clears

Waldorf hands Tex a giant contract

WALDORF (CONTD)
Here’s the Standard Rich and Famous
Contract Kermit signed twenty five
years ago This contract is
absolutely positively iron clad
With one exception that shouldnt
be an issue for any logical reason
but I should let you know if the
Muppets put on a show and get ten
million viewers before this
contract expires we can no longer
sell Muppet studios to you The
contract expires

(he uses a monocle to read

the fine print)
-- in two weeks at which point this
property is yours

STATLER
If I didn’t know better I’d say you
were reciting some sort of
important plot point

WALDORF
I hope so Otherwise I just bored
the audience half to death

STATLER
You mean half the audience is still
alive

Statler and Waldorf laugh and exit IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE

DOOR CLOSES TEXS TONE SHIFTS

HIMSELF

HE SPEAKS MANICALLY TO

ll

TEX

Theres oil under this studio
see I can smell it I can smell
it in my wallet Sweet sweet oil
In two weeks we tear this place to
the ground and start harvesting the
sweet sweet oil under this waste of
space Muppets

(he spits)
The Muppets ain’t done nothin’ in
ten years The only way they could
save the studio according to this
contract is if they get back
together and put on a show within
the next two weeks that draws in 10
million viewers but that ain’t
gonna happen No sir This studio
is gone see And me well I’m
gonna be even richer than I already
am

Walter listens in shock as Tex lets out a DEMONIC LAUGH then
a fly lands on this face He quickly sucks it up into his
mouth and leaves Walter rises looks around nervously then
sprints out of the room

EXT HENSON STUDIOS LA BREA - MOMENTS LATER
Walter comes tearing out of the studio past security
emitting a high pitched and frantic scream
INT BUS MOMENTS LATER
The entire bus stares silently at Walter who continues to let
out his high pitched scream as he rides
INT GARY’S BOARDWALK APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

THROUGH THE DOOR CONTINUING HIS HIGH PITCHED SCREAM He runs
around the apartment frantically THEN HE LEAPS ONTO GARY

nose He said the only thing that
could stop him would be if the
Muppets got back together and put
on a show

GARY
Thats impossible The Muppets
broke up No one can get them back
together

WALTER
No way That’s just a paparazzi-

GARY THROW ME OVER ALREADY

Walter jumps into Gary’s arms He balls Walter up and HURLS
WALTER but he doesn’t quite make it over the fence Instead
he hits the top and gets ELECTROCUTED

GARY
OH MY GOSH WALTER

The electricity keeps Walter on the gates for an
excruciatingly long time until finally he falls smoking to
the ground Gary rushes to his side

GARY (CONTD)

Walter delirious looks up at him

WALTER
(weak)
Throw me again

MARY

Mary RINGS THE DOORBELL

GARY WALTER

They wait in anticipation finally a voice comes through the
intercom IT IS KERMIT THE FROG

KERMIT
Hi ho

A long beat No one knows what to do

BUZZ2Z2Z Like a scene from the Wizard of Oz Gary Walter and
Mary stand frozen as the huge gates open to Kermit’s mansion
After a long beat Kermit emerges from his front door and
walks towards them

He looks the same physically but he walks very slowly with a
cane and wears a Hugh Hefneresque smoking jacket As he limps
towards them our group takes in what is by any stretch a
sad sight Kermit is old

WALTER
Oh my gosh He’s he’s old

MARY
I guess frog puppets age faster
than humans

As Kermit walks towards them Walter begins to cry Kermit
sees this and stops

KERMIT
Are you crying No I was just

He throws down his cane does a perfect summersault and
begins tap dancing The gang watches confused

KERMIT (CONT’D)

Willy Wonka thing Ive just always
wanted to do that Come on in

a INT KERMIT’S MANSION - LATER

Kermit Gary and an EMBARRASSINGLY STAR STRUCK WALTER sit in
Kermit’s lavish living room

started and then people just
stopped coming by It gets kind of
lonely Im actually glad you came
by So what brings you here

GARY
Well sir my friend Walter heard
some disturbing news today

KERMIT
(to Walter)
Oh yeah what’s that

All turn to Walter who just stares at Kermit trembling

tg

KERMIT (CONT’D)
What’s the matter cat got your
tongue

Walter NODS vigorously Kermit BENDS DOWN and grabs his cat

KERMIT (CONT’D)
Cmon Miss Fluffy This is
neither the time nor the place

The cat SPITS OUT a puppet tongue Kermit hands the tongue
to Walter who reattaches it to his mouth They watch for a
painfully long beat as Walter starts shaking again harder
and harder Finally

WALTER
(terrified)
PPPPPPPPPPPeanut

All look at Walter confused
GARY

When he’s nervous peanut’s the
only thing he can say

WALTER
Peanut I’m sorry I’m nervous
Peanut
(growing more and more
agitated)

Peanut Peanut
Peanutpeanutpeanutpeanut

Walter stops to catch his breath

KERMIT
Oil Barron Tex Richman is gonna
tear down the studio to drill for
oil And the only thing that’1l
save it is if we put on a show that
gets ten million viewers within two
weeks

WALTER -
(panting and nodding)
Peanut

KERMIT
Put on a show I couldn’t do that
on my own

GARY
Well what about the rest of the
Muppets

KERMIT
I havent been in touch with those
guys in years

WALTER
You should get them back together

KERMIT
Its easier said than done

Kermits face falls

KERMIT (CONT’D)
SINGS “I MISS THE MUPPETS” SONG

As Kermit sings he walks down a hallway of photos and
memories When he reaches the end of the hallway he
awkwardly turns around and sings about the same memories he
passed once again however this time he sings about how
impossible it’1l be to get back together because they all
have gripes with each other now

KERMIT (CONT’D)

(a song version of this)
We would need someone to rally
around someone young and innocent
and not specifically any one sort
of animal or figure in particular
Someone likewell

(reaching Walter)
-you

WALTER
(shaking)
Me But I’m not a Muppet

KERMIT
You could be You seem a little
Muppety

Walter starts shaking

WALTER
But I don’t even have a talent
I’m just a trick A cheap trick

KERMIT
Youll find your talent You
remind me of me when I was young

‘Walter immediately faints

KERMIT (CONTD)
Now we just need to get in touch
with them all

Kermit hits a button and his wet bar SPINS AROUND revealing a
GIANT GREEN BUTTON

Show Beacon to be pressed only
in case we need to put on a show

of these

children are smarter and better
than all this junk Sure they’1l
watch that stuff if you don’t offer
them anything else but we have a
chance to make this world better
and more fun You’re not going to
do that by filling their heads with
robots and violence or with rich
kids shopping or with boring
floating numbers you’re going to
do it by filling their heads with
laughter and friendship and hope I
just think well I know we’re
not famous anymore but I want you
to know I think you’re making a big
mistake

Kermit nods and reaches for the door handle to leave

Electric Mayhem PULLS a sheet off their instruments Animal
goes to touch the drums and then BACKS AWAY scared Gonzo
walks into his supply room and PULLS a sheet off his various

rotten food He pulls a flamethrower and BURNS all the food

fit in the 0

INT MUPPET STUDIOS - FLASHBACK

We see a flashback of the the Muppet Show sign dropping with
Fozzie in the “0” The O breaks off and hangs by one screw
It then smashes to the ground

-- Miss Piggy in the “0” She’s holding on for dear life and
screaming

-- Sweet Ums in the “O” Or rather only the bottom half of
Sweet Ums The top half of him is off screen

-- The Muppet Show sign is dropping There’s no one in the
0 Suddenly the O CATCHES FIRE and Gonzo in a motorcycle
FLIES THROUGH THE O Or rather tries to fly through the 0
He basically SMASHES right into the 0 He and the rest of

the sign catches on fire Several Muppets put him out with
fire hoses

INT STAGE - PRESENT DAY

KERMIT
Look guys let’s not argue Maybe
we‘re just jumping too far ahead
Lets see some acts

CUT TO MOMENTS LATER

GONZO
The Great Gonzo needs a fearless
human volunteer willing to risk his
life or at the very least his
cognitive capacity

Everyone looks to Gary the only human He rises tentatively
and Gonzo sits him in a chair and places a pin on his head
Camilla comes out and brings Gonzo a bowling ball

KERMIT
Oh wait NOT THE BOWLING BALL
TRICK No Don’t do it Gary
He’11 kill you

The Muppets all turn and hush Kermit Walter turns to Kermit

WALTER
What’s wrong with the bowling ball
trick

INT MUPPET STUDIOS - FLASHBACK

Several quick shots of the young Gonzo flinging bowling balls
at people with pins on their heads and NAILING THEM IN
DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BODY VERY VIOLENTLY sending them
flying off their chairs

INT STAGE - PRESENT

And we’re back Now Walter looks terrified too Gonzo
begins swinging the bowling ball in a circular motion round
and round building anticipation

KERMITWALTER
No Please Not again
Somebody stop this madnessGet
down from there Gary

But it is too late Gonzo releases the Bowling ball and it
flies towards Gary’s head who closes his eyes in terror The
crowd gasps in fear as the bowling ball PERFECTLY KNOCKS THE
PIN OFF Gary’s HEAD The group erupts in applause

KERMIT
HE DIT IT
(to God)

THANK YOU Thank you

GONZO
(with a bow)
Youre welcome Donations are

A gaggle of CHICKENS walk through the group with buckets and
some Muppets throw in money Kermit runs onstage Kermit
looks down at his clipboard

KERMIT
Okay next Bunsen and Beaker

Ne Bunsen and Beaker pull back a curtain immediately behind
Gonzo where they stand next to a mysterious device

DR BUNSEN HONEYDEW
The Bowling ball act is actually a
group routine

GONZO
(embarrassed)
Bunsen don’t---

DR BUNSEN HONEYDEW
Allow me to explain This is my
Temporal Displacement Machine To
the casual observer Gonzo’s stunt
looks indeed miraculous However
it is in fact my device that is
truly astonishing

GONZO
Dr NO

Bunsen flips a screen around on the Machine and replays the
stunt for the Muppets

DR BUNSEN HONEYDEW
You see at the moment of release
my faithful assistant Beaker--

BEAKER
Meep Meep
DR BUNSEN HONEYDEW
(cont)
--- turns the temporal displacement
dial
(pointing to a dial on the
device)

Slowing time to a near halt

We watch on the screen as everything begins to move
incredibly slowly The bowling ball is clearly going to hit
Gary in the crotch We watch as Beaker walks on stage and
literally guides the bowling ball directly to the pin on
Garys head then casually walk out of frame

DR BUNSEN HONEYDEW (CONT’D)
Time then resumes it’s normal speed
and the audience is none the wiser

GONZO
(guiltily)
What I don’t want to kill someone
Again

Kermit looks at the dial

KERMIT
Wait The dial here says slow
slower and perfect pasta Why the
perfect pasta setting

DR BUNSEN HONEYDEW
You never know when you might need
perfect pasta

KERMIT
(to Gonzo)
Gonzo you do stunts That’s what
the people expect The Muppets
aren’t about cheap tricks Were
about actual talent

ANGLE ON Walter He looks uncomfortable
KERMIT (CONT’D)
Now you have to promise if you do
this stunt you won’t be using that
freezing time machine
Gonzo nods and skulks off

Amid the noise Kermit sneaks out A second later TEX
RICHMAN HOPS INTO the theater

TEX
Look at you sorry Muppets You

rehearsal The only way you could
ever save the studio --

OKIE WEALTHGENT (0S)

calling down from an Opera box opposite Statler and Waldorf
He holds the thick STANDARD CONTRACT

TEX RICHMAN
And just who exactly are you

TEX RICHMAN
(Kermit’s voice)
Uh-oh

We hear the sound of a zipper from within Tex’s body then
slowly the TEX RICHMAN “HUMAN SUIT” sloughs to the ground
revealing KERMIT The Muppets are shocked

KERMIT
Guys I think I made a big mistake

INT COURTROOM LATER

Kermit sits in the Witness chair Our Muppets sit in the jury
box and Sam the Eagle presides as Judge Janice and Scooter
sit as Prosecution and Defense and the rest of our Muppets
sit in the pews and watch the proceedings

KERMIT
--because I missed you guys and I
didn’t know how else to get us back
together So I created a fake
enemy Tex Richman that we could
all unite against But then Okie
Wealthgent showed up thinking
there really is oil under the
studio I guess the oil business is
relatively competitive Who knew

Janice stands

JANICE
So likehow do we know that
likeyou’re not also Okie
Wealthgent

The Muppets mumble in agreement

KERMIT
Well because we were both at the
same place at the same time

JANICE
Like were you though I only
recall like Tex Richman and Okie
Wealthgent being there together

More mumbled agreement

KERMIT
Well if you think it through--

JANICE
Sustained

KERMIT
Youre not supposed to say that

e

e The Muppets consider

JANICE
One final question your honor

SAM THE EAGLE
Proceed hippie

JANICE
Like why do you have a courtroom
in your house

KERMIT
There’s fifty rooms in this house
and I ran out of ideas so I
thought how about a courtroom
Glad it finally came in handy

JANICE
(as though she got him)
Like so you say I rest my case

The Muppets all mumble to each other Then a small voice is
heard from the back of the room

WALTER
Your fake honor may I approach the
fake bench

SAM THE EAGLE
You may flattened miniature
badger

Walter who was sitting next to Gary heads to the front of
the room and addresses the Muppets

WALTER
When I was just a little brown
puppet I felt really all alone
Then I saw my first episode of the
Muppet show and even though I
didn’t know any of you I finally
had something to hope for That
someday I could be a Muppet You
guys have the power to change
people to give kids hope but the
only way you can do it is if you
work together to defeat this Okie
Wealthgent guy Now I know I’m not
one of you but maybe that’s why I
can see it all so clearly You guys
are being stupid Like really
stupid Like super duper stupid

(MORE )

WALTER (CONTD)
Now how about we cut it out and put
on a show already

Silence Finally Janice stands

JANICE
Your honor like in light of the
soggy burnt poptart’s speech the
Muppets would like to like drop
all charges and put on a show

is best expressed in a female power
