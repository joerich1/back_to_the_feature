FADE IN
A GNARLED HAND

Cracked caltused fingers spider-crawl along crumbling
stone reach a point marked with crooked lines in groups
of seven A long thick fingernail shakily scratches a fresh

LINE in the wall -- one more day

In shadows and beams of light a FIGURE can be barely
discerned Enough to make out a man -- seraggly unshaven
Crouched in a corner nursing a black eye a swollen lip

Meet ADAM WORTH the greatest criminal mastermind of his
day Youd never know it by looking at him now

investigator REINHARDT and a refined London attorney STONE

WORTH

Worth looks over tofind WILLIAM PINKERTON -- scion of the
detective agency that bears the family name Hes rugged
and dignified a man of both action and intellect Theyve
known each other a long time but never like this --

WORTH
Cant say as I do

Pinkerton nods the others to go they do He regards Worth

PINKERTON
Care to sit

Worth shakes his head no Pinkerton moves to a chair
with a slight limp

PINKERTON (CONTD)
The old war wound Some days it
flares up

WORTH
Imagine the world without the
invention of the rifle

PINKERTON
Yes Imagine it

The once-easy patter between them is dimmed now but not
disappeared The twinkle in Worths eye is hard evasive

PINKERTON (CONTD)
Ive come to take you home

WORTH
Why I rather fancy it here Weve
got a swell group of lads

PINKERTON
You dont have to pretend with me
I know who you are And that man
would never choose to rot in prison

WORTH
Why are you here

PINKERTON
Simply to preserve his identity

WORTH
What identity

It comes out fiercely Pinkerton is taken aback
PINKERTON

You insist on denying then even to
me that you are in fact Adam Worth

WORTH
Ive no idea who Adam Worth is

Pinkerton studies him Hes sure its Worth and yet hes

not the man he once knew -- diminished beaten down T
PINKERTON
You got too big Adam -- anonymity

is a thing of the past

(then intent)
Let them have their damn painting
Well be on a ship to the continent
in three days Kitty will be glad
to see you

Worth’s look changes for a moment before he covers it

PINKERTON (CONTD)
Ive been to visit her And the
children She gave me this for you

He hands over a small BLUE ENVELOPE Worth softens a little --

WORTH
If I were this brilliant fiend Worth --
why should I believe Id get a deal

PINKERTON
I think Ive earned your trust

WORTH

Its not you Im worried about

Pinkerton changes tactics goes for the hard sell --

PINKERTON
If they dont get their painting
back theyve asked me to offer up

any evidence TI have against you If
I do your sentence here will be
extended not commuted -- after which

theyll pack you off to London or
New York for another trial and more
jail time You could spend the rest
of your life behind bars

Worth knows what he faces but still he holds fast —-

WORTH
Sorry old man The names Edward
Grey feather trader

PINKERTON
Come now be reasonable

WORTH
I accidentally misappropriated some
diamonds that didn’t belong to me

PINKERTON

Dont play games

WORTH
Thats all they know Detective

PINKERTON
Its not so simple

WORTH
Theyre not clever enough to dig up
anything else on me

PINKERTON
Unless I help them

Pinkertons anger chastens and sobers Worth

WORTH
Yes Unless you help them

PINKERTON
Im a lawman what do you expect me
to do

As your conscience dictates

PINKERTON

Reinhardt Stone and the Guard enter Worth addresses them -

WORTH
Im ready to descend again

REINHARDT
Has he come to his senses Mister
Pinkerton

STONE
Will he surrender the Duchess

Theres a tense moment -- Pinkerton caught between a lifelong
duty and an odd sense of loyalty The loyalty wins out -

PINKERTON
Gentlemen forgive me -- this is not
the man I believed him to be
Reinhardt squints disbelieving -- Stone is baffled

PINKERTON (CONTD)
Im unable to heip you

Worth and Pinkerton hold an almost conspiratorial look

of the world-famous painting of Georgiana feather hat tilted
seductively down over one eye the other peeks out invitingly

Commissioner stands surrounded by some girls

Worth leans agaiust a bar near the Commissioner -- eyes him
Positions himself behind the mark -- taps a girl on the
shouider flirts with her his hands out of sight

After a moment he takes leave of the girl makes his way
back to the table He sits down unloads -- billfold some

MARM (CONTD)
Now the hard part - put it all back
before he starts rounding us up

A few sad notes tinkle from the piano

SCRATCH
Oh no Charleys started in on the
weepies

The MUSIC RISES and all focus turns to Bullard singing

BULLARD
I dreamt I dwelt in marble halls
With vassels and serfs at my side
(MORE)

BULLARD (CONTD)
And of all who assembled within those
walls That I was the hope and pride

Worth looks around at the table of reprobates hes seated
with Theyre genuinely touched by the maudlin song

BULLARD (CONTD)
Had riches too great to count
could boast Of a high ancestral
name

As the song goes on Worth looks across the salon and spots
A LOVELY YOUNG WOMAN accompanied by a fine old man A low-
class girl gone to great efforts to put herself together

BULLARD (CONTD)
Bot T also dreamt which pleasd
me most That you loved me still the
same

Feeling a mans eyes upon her the girl turns Meet KITTY
FLYNN who -- with her openly alluring stare -- has a
striking likeness to the Duchess Georgiana Kitty WINKS at
Worth -- as the playing card did -- then turns to Bullard

painting in a gilt frame Faintly he can make out that it
is the Gainsborough He removes his hat walks over to it

He unclips a velvet rope used to keep the public a safe
distance from the painting and steps into the protected area

Worth lights a match The canvas glows from the flame --
the beckoning mocking smile of the Duchess The bequiling
wounded eyes

He leans in his face close to the canvas His hand reaches
up and touches the Duchess’ painted cheek Shes a beauty

Suddenly Worth HEARS a GRUMBLE and a SNORE He turns to
see a watchman fast asleep across the room by the door A
bottle of booze half-empty on the floor beside him

Delicately Worth removes a small blade from his pocket and
carefully cuts the perimeter of the canvas removing it from
the frame HEAR Pinkerton reading from a newspaper article --

PINKERTON (V0)
dt is very rarely that robbery
of valuable paintings in this way
has been attempted

Worth lays the canvas out on the floor

PINKERTON (V0) (CONTD)
And rarely if ever we believe
without discovery in the end

He pulls a small pot of paste from his pocket Using the
tassels of the velvet rope he daubs the back of the canvas
to make it supple

PINKERTON (V0) (CONTD)
‘In the case of a picture of such
remarkable notoriety and interest

Worth rolls up the canvas paint facing outward to prevent
cracking He slips it inside his frock coat

PINKERTON (V0O) (CONTD)
it is hoped that it will be
recovered uninjured

Finally he pulls a small card from a pocket and places it
within the now-empty frame

PINEKRTON (VO)
1 And the audacious thief or

thieves’

The card reads The Duchess has eloped”
PINKERTON (V0)

brought to justice’

summons strength to try throwing a roundhouse but Pinkerton
sidesteps it then lands a crunching uppercut to poor
Saunders chin -- SMASH -- Saunder drops like a sack of
lead The operatives look un in awe as he moans and
Pinkerton panting turns to them -

PINKERTON

As Pinkerton hands a drink he sees Worths nose is bleeding
Makes a gesture Worth dabs it with a handkerchief

PINKERTON (CONTD)
Are you all right

WORTH
There were some rough types in that
prisen very uncivilized

PINKERTON
I heard Shinburn was dead

Theres a cautious distance about Pinkerton as he surmises
Worth who is strangely Casual glib

PINKERTON (CONTD)
I thought Id never see you again
That perhaps you preferred to end
your life in jail

WORTH

The notion crossed my mind
PINKERTON

Im glad you overcame it
WORTH

Theres something I want to show

you
He puts the tube down on the desktop

WORTH (CONTD)
May I present Lady Georgiana nee
Spencer the Duchess of Devonshire

Worth rolls the CANVAS out on the desk Pinkertons

fatalism -- of course he had it He always had it

PINKERTON
So its my fault

WORTH
No I was destined for this Ima
stock figure in a pitiful melodrama --
the man who ruins his lite tor a
woman he can never have

PINKERTON
Not a woman -- the idea of a woman

Worth takes that in -- theres the rub

armed robbers and killers Compared
to them you werent such a bad
fellow I hope you don’t take that

utter failure as a villain
