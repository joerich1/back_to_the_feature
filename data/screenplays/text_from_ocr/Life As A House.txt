light and ocean breeze enter through an open window Bold
waves crash against the cliffs outside the room A five-

wide stack of hand hewed beams are piled pyramid style
making movement in the room next to impossible George

over a pile of tools and stands at the window facing the

and all that I saw just keeps going on and on

EXT DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - MORNING

The traffic is thick and loud and the sky is a blanket of
brown as George makes his way down a sidewalk mixed with
professionals and panhandlers Suddenly sick George

to the side of a building and vomits

office Bryan approaches with his arm outstretched but
George can only raise the paper towels

GEORGE
A bird caught me
Bryan grabs a trashcan and holds it up George tosses the
ball into the trash and sits down

BRYAN
Orange juicecroissant

Bryan motions with his hand as he sits

GEORGE
Im good thanks

BRYAN
What are you on

GEORGE
Pardon me

BRYAN
how much weight have you lost

GEORGE
Ohnothing Thirty pounds I just
havent been very hungry

BRYAN
Hows your wife

GEORGE
When we divorce a decade ago she was
very very angry
(beat)
Now shes just hostile

Bryan nods and laughs as he takes a chunk of croissant and
chews as he talks

BRYAN
Rightshe marriedwhat was he

GEORGE
He buys and sells the world

BRYAN
Peter Webber Right Quite the
spotlight on that guy

GEORGE
I did tell you didnt I That Id be
ready to start the Berlin model today

BRYAN
Well thats sort ofyoure sure youre
not hungry

Bryan is anxious as he holds up the rest of the croissant

George shakes his head no Bryan tosses his croissant
into
the trash can and leans forward
BRYAN (CONTD)
This isnt me
(beat)
We can show clients endless options
change anything in a matter of hours on
the computer But you wont change
GEORGE
Typing and clicking myself to renderings
isnt why I started building models
BRYAN
All of us are typing and clicking
George Whether we want to or not
GEORGE
Im not
BRYAN
Which is why we bid out a quarter of our
projects It doesnt make a lot of sense
anymore to want what we dont have and
dont want what we do
George glances around the office angered by the thought
hes

being fired

GEORGE
Ive been here twenty years

BRYAN
Maybe thats too long

GEORGE
(hopeful)
Maybe

BRYAN
Thats too long

George nods as he stares at Bryan

BRYAN (CONTD)
Listen they decided on a week a year
severance but I got them to twenty-six
Thats six months salary George
Medical and everything for six months
You can learn all you need to on the
computer long before that Maybe find a
job closer to home

Bryan is rattled by Georges blank stare He takes his
glass

of orange juice and sits back in his chair taking a sip
all

the while keeping an eye on George

GEORGE
My wife left me because I wasntvery
emotional I kept trying to explain that
my father sucked all the emotion from me
Drunks do that sometimes Make their
kids afraid Make them unwilling to
express themselves

Bryan knows hes supposed to say something he just cant
seem to figure out what

BRYAN
Oh

GEORGE
How old are you

BRYAN
Forty

GEORGE
We were probably in school together You
went to Berkley

Bryan lights up at the sound of his Alma matter

BRYAN
Class of eighty-six I didnt know you
were there

GEORGE
I was a sophomore when I got the call my
parents were dead

This is not the direction Bryan had hoped the conversation
was headed

GEORGE (CONTD)
My dad had a blood alcohol level of 18
A little high Drove right into oncoming
traffic Killed my mother with him A
lady in another car Hurt her daughter
A five-year old girl I think about her
still

Bryan wants this to end He leans forward with a whisper

BRYAN
Listenmaybe I can get you a year

GEORGE
I hate this job

BRYAN
What are you talking about You love
your job

GEORGE
From the day I startedto today Cant
stand it

Bryan is perplexed as George stands

BRYAN
Then it sounds like Im doing you a
favor

GEORGE

It may sound that way but I react out of
fear My life has nothing to do with
what I like or dont like You havent
been listening have you

BRYAN
I didnt know there would be a quiz
George

GEORGE

For everything

BRYAN
Well I feel better about this now

GEORGE
Good I was hoping for that

Relieved and not understanding anything about irony Bryan
stands and extends his hand George shakes Bryans hand

without malice

GEORGE (CONTD)
again

He

Ive got one favor to ask

BRYAN
What can I do for you George

GEORGE

I built my first model here when I was
twenty There are hundreds of them on
shelves around the office Twenty years

of my life I was wondering if I might
be able to pick a few to keep to take
home Only the ones that really mean
something to me
Bryan recoils slightly from the request
BRYAN
Oh wellthose areI mean we dont

get to keep our work I could maybe ask

them if you could choose one
know frankly George you were
Computer models cant begin to
beauty you gave yours Theyr
this firm They inspire me
there and sometimes just stare

I would miss that too much

GEORGE
Thank you

BRYAN
Well its the least I can do

GEORGE
Yes it is

George nods and leaves Bryan looks los

t and guilty

INT BENSON KIDDLER FEINSILBER AND ASSOICATES - MORNING

George walks around the maze of cubicles back to his own

finds an empty box and starts to pack

Against a wall

a
large rack is filled with spools of architectural plans
George pulls one of the plans down rolls it out and

detaches
the wooden spool Without warning and with a fury hard to
fathom he proceeds to bat and smash a shelf of
beautifully
rendered models Heads pop up in other cubicles as George
walks out of his own and armed with a frightening rage
methodically attacks model after model resting on shelves
just below massive plate glass windows that frame downtown
Los Angeles Steven Gardner who asked for his model
without
grass rushes to within feet of George as he witness his
creation deconstruct into shards of cardboard and plastic
STEVEN
Mother of God Not my house
George stops for a second to focus on Steven but Steven
is
smart enough to run George continues on with the
business
of disassembling his work
VOICE
Oh please please no
The plea is instantly followed by a pathetic low whine
George works up a sweat as he whacks model after model
portions of plastic walls or window splatter the office as
though bombed in war Bryan Burkes secretary inches as
close as she dares
SECRETARY
UhMr Burke would like a word with
you George
George lowers his stick as he faces her

Ohokay

prior

on every shelf in the office save one Workers huddle
together collectively moaning and moving en mass from the

and cradles it carefully as he walks into Bryan Burkes
office

INT BRYAN BURKES OFFICE - MORNING
Bryan cowers behind his desk as George enters with his
in one hand and the long wooden stick in the other

GEORGE
Ill take this one if thats okay

It takes Bryan a few aborted attempts to answer before he
simply nods

GEORGE (CONTD)
Thank you for going out on a limb and
allowing me one

Bryan nods again then quivers as George steps forward
the stick against the desk and extends his hand
GEORGE (CONTD)
Youre a great architect and a miserable

human being

Bryan winces as he extends his hand They shake hands and
George grabs hold of the stick again

BRYAN
Thank you

George walks around the desk and bashes in a model hidden
the floor one that Bryan had obviously wanted to save

BRYAN (CONTD)
Oh fuck

George drops the wooden spool and walks out of the office
Bryan garners the courage to stand

George closes the door behind him Bryan stares down at
remains of the model he gets down on his knees and
gathers up the pieces

EXT DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - MORNING

George is sweating as he walks with his box of personal
under one arm and the model under the other Dizzy he
for a moment and tires to orient himself glancing one

then the other before staggering back and pressing himself
against the building for support Sweat beads and drops

his nose and chin as the song ACROSS THE UNIVERSE
by The Beatles George sets the box down but clings
to the model as he closes his eyes

Pools of sorrow waves of joy are drifting through my

mind possessing them caressing me

George drops face first to the cement crushing the model
beneath him

MONTAGE AS THE SONG CONTINUES

George is probed and poked by doctor after doctor An
ultrasound test followed by a CT scan followed by a MRI
results in more tests

A flexible tube is slid down Georges throat as dye is
into his body Sounds of laughter shades of life are
ringing through my open view inciting them inviting

A long blunt needle is shoved into Georges side fora

of his pancreas X-rays are lit and highlighted as

ponder the specks the disease
Finally George is opened up nearly bloodless slice

through

skin muscle and fat reveals death Limitless undying
love

which shines around me like a million suns which calls me
on

and on across the universe

George is wheeled down a long hall to the critical care
unit

Nothings going to change my world nothings gonna
change

my world’

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - EVENING

George tries to sit up but falls back as he closes his
eyes

opens his eyes closes his eyes

FEMALE VOICE (0S)
That took care of the pain

George opens his eyes again as an attractive NURSE enters
with a tray of food

GEORGE
I could kiss you

The nurse smiles as she lifts the cover off the dinner

GEORGE (CONTD)
No food Im painless

She raises Georges bed

GEORGE (CONTD)
What would you do if you had three or
four months to live

The nurse glances over at the other patient in the room
whos sleeping before answering in a soft voice

NURSE
Id eat a lot of red meat

GEORGE
Good for you

The nurse smiles as she sits down beside the bed She
fills
a spoon with corn and aims it for Georges mouth he
accepts
the good will chews and swallows

NURSE

Sam shrugs off his mother looking away Robin nods and
grabs a piece for herself

ROBIN (CONTD)
Youre too thin George From what you

George responds with a pleasant face hes not going to
explain his weight loss right now

GEORGE

ROBIN
The first because I wasnt sure you

interested
in the conversation his ears are perked

GEORGE
I was up on the roof this morning
tearing it down and it struck me as
strong as anything ever has That Im
happy today

ROBIN
What have you been before today

GEORGE

It was just that maybe the way the sun
struck the ocean the sound of the waves
It was simple whatever it was Then I
started thinking about the last time I
felt this good

(beat)

Its been a long time

ROBIN
Do you remember

GEORGE
The only time I can think of for sure I
was holding onto Sam in the ocean saving
him from the waves

George turns to Sam whos caught staring at his father

GEORGE (CONTD)
You head was pressed against my chest I
could feel your heart racing And I
remember I kissed your hair

ROBIN

take it back pressing her hand to her mouth wiping her
eyes but whatever emotion has her has her good Both

takes it and stuffs it in his pants pocket

JOSH
It beats working

Inhale and get out

Sam is quick to inhale but slow to get out Josh takes

Gusters ALL THE WAY UP TO HEAVEN Sam closes the door
the Mercedes He said to only look up he said to never
look down down is where we came from Its an odd song
sung in a happy tempo a whistling refrain overtakes the
lyrics as Josh inhales He said to hope for the best and
take a load off my chest Soon I could be happy and go
the way up to heaven and go all the way back home

With the music loud Josh misses the police car as it

behind him without the lights Too late for a getaway he
fumbles for his cell phone and tosses the joint out the

window The OFFICER approaches the Porsche with his hand
his gun

hops out with his pants around his ankles The officer
notices and walks towards the Mercedes The parking

up his pants and leaps down the hillside falling and

in the brush as the officer yells for him to stop Josh
starts his car but the officer dissuades him from leaving

removing his gun Josh turns off the engine

JOSH
Oh its working now

OFFICER
What did you toss into the brush

Before Josh can feign innocence again the brush starts to
smolder Busted

EXT HILLSIDE - NIGHT

Sam is spotted with weeds and dirt as he continues his way
down the steep hillside holding up his pants After hes
sure hes safe he sits down and rests his head in his

He starts to shake frightened by his actions He drops
his back buttons and zips his pants as he starts to cry
Slowly he stops crying but keeps staring up at the sky
which is loaded with stars and a full moon Mesmerized by
the brilliant night Sam cant stop staring

on
the patio table

It was perfect George Amazing It was
so real

GEORGE

My tongue around the edge of his ear is
what cured him

George isnt quite sure how to take her comment Finally
he

points to the Garage

GEORGE
Go in there and lick his attitude

ROBIN
The antibiotics werent working
(beat)
Its what I believe George

George stares at Robin for a second before he nods
GEORGE

You were wrong about the first year you
know
It takes Robin a second to understand hes saying he loved
her when they married

ROBIN
Ive been wrong a lot in my life

GEORGE
Hindsight Its like foresight without a
future

Robin almost smiles George confessing love ten years
dead

ROBIN
I have three hours before I pick up Adam
and Ryan
(beat)
Where will I be most useful

Robin glances around assessing the best use of her time

GEORGE
With your hands or your tongue

ROBIN
Youre not well

Robin picks up a pile of splintered board and tosses them
in
the garbage bin George nodshes not

LATER

Robin and George carry a twelve-foot beam from inside the

shack and set it down on cinder blocks Both look
exhausted

as they head back in for another beam Sam saunters out
of

the garage in shorts sits down on the patio chair and
opens

the sack his mother had packed for lunch He pulls out a

peanut butter and jelly sandwich and starts eating as
George

and Robin emerge from the shack with another beam

Good morning

Robin and George set the beam down and turn to Sam as they
both wipe sweat off their faces Sam chews his sandwich
ignoring them both
on

Robin

ROBIN

Robin walks close to Sam trying to capture his attention

ROBIN (CONTD)
Ryan has a game later He asked if youd
come and watch

Sam glances up at his mother just long enough to let her
know he hates her then drops the sandwich and walks back
into the garage A city inspectors car pulls to a stop
the street and BOB LARSON steps out with a clipboard

passes him as she walks back to her Range Rover

BOB
Mr Stevens

GEORGE
Ive been dreading you

Bob and George shake hands as Robin drives off

BOB
Bob Larson Do you happen to have an
unenclosed toilet in close proximity to a
kitchen

GEORGE
A violation

BOB
Oh yes

GEORGE
And if I enclosed it

BOB
An exhaust system or a window is code

A sink

BOB
Allowed outside the enclosed area

Sam walks out of the garage in long pants and a shirt

SAM
Where is it

GEORGE
A friend of yours is here

SAM

Sam
and Bob in tow

Whered you put it
INT GARAGE - AFTERNOON
George walks to an armoire and empties it He grabs a
hammer
and bangs pries and pulls the back off then dumps the
cabinet onto the floor
SAM
I know you took it I want it now
George yanks the chain saw to a roar and fashions an oval
cut
a few feet deep on the cabinet base He kills the saw
lifts

the armoire and scoots it in front of the toilet

GEORGE
Doors

Bob grimaces as George opens the armoire revealing the
toilet inside

BOB
I hate to ask about a window

GEORGE
(to Sam)
I flushed it down the toilet

SAM
No Oh my God

George jerk starts the chain saw again and fashions a
small
like

kills

opening above the toilet ripping through the studs wire

mesh tar
a storm

the chain

Bob seems

George is

paper and stucco - fine dust invades the space
Bob coughs as he writes in his book George
saw and sets it down as he surveys his work

SAM (CONTD)
If I had a gun Id kill you

fairly anxious to conclude his business

BOB
I assume youll fill theuh window
with glass

GEORGE
If thats what it takes

SAM
Whats in my pants is none of your
fucking business

BOB
(a little rattled)
I would say youre in compliance

GEORGE
I hope that makes the pain in the ass
that called you happy

staring at Sam Bob backs out of the garage

BOB
You and me both

With Bob gone George walks to Sam and gets in his face

Sam slams

GEORGE
Everything about you is my business
What you smoke what you swallow what
you sniff its all my business

his fists against his own chest maddened

SAM
Ive been using since I was twelve
Youre all so unbelievably stupid You
didnt give a shit about anything I did
until now

GEORGE
Ill apologize for everything but
todayToday I give a shit

SAM
Youre too fucking late

GEORGE
The gloves on the table are for you

SAM
You cant make me do a thing

GEORGE
Sit down for a second

SAM
No

George gently guides Sam back onto the bed Sam hops up

mad
SAM (CONTD)
Ill call the cops if you touch me again
George sets Sam back onto the bed not so gently this
time

Sam is less eager to hop up in defiance

SAM (CONTD)

Oh so youre in the big shit now Child
abuse People go to prison for what you
just did to me

GEORGE
My dad used to play a game I never
really understood what it was until after
he was gone

Sam appears immensely disinterested

SAM
I was holding for someone That wasnt
even mine

GEORGE

The game was to make me smaller than he
was No matter what He could be almost
invisible as a human being but I had to
be smaller So if I got good grades I
was a pussy for not playing football If
I cut my hair for him it wasnt short
enough If I shaved it I looked like a
what

psycho I never won the game Not once
And if he couldnt make me smaller with
words

Tears well in Georges eyes Sam is caught up enough in

his father has to say that he has to feign his lack of
interest

SAM
ll have to pay him back

GEORGE

wont ever hit you

(beat)

dont want you smaller I want you to
be happy Youre not Not here with me
Not home with your mother Not up in
Tahoe Not alone Not anywhere

(beat)
Youre what I was most of my life Sam
see it in your eyes In your sleep

n your answer to everything Youre
barely alive

SAM
m not even listening

GEORGE

You know that great thing though Is
that change can be so constant you dont
even feel the difference until there is
one It can be so slow that you dont
even notice that your life is better or
worse until it is

(beat)
Or it can just blow you away Make you
something different in an instant It
happened to me

George walks to the garage door as he wipes his eyes He
stops and turns back around to face Sam

GEORGE (CONTD)
Build this house with me

George walks out leaving Sam on the bed to think
EXT GEORGES BEACH SHACK - AFTERNOON

George gathers a pile of splintered boards and tosses them
into the dumpster He works while Guster sleeps

LATER

The sun is fierce low on the horizon with a heat that
distorts the distance George is sweating and shirtless

Sam walks out of the garage with the gloves on and stands
staring at his father After a beat George notices him

SAM
I have to pay back what you flushed down
the toilet
(beat)
I want ten dollars an hourthen Im

George nods He points out the roofless shell of a shack

GEORGE
It all has to come down before we can
start again
(beat)
Knock it down

George picks up a sledghammer and hands it to Sam Sam
hoists the hefty hammer and with some true effort slams

on a sideboard He slams again and again as George picks
a slightly smaller sledgehammer
GEORGE (CONTD)
I hated this house from the second my
father cheated everyone and put it in my
name
George takes a good hard whack at the wall knocking a
hunk of it down Sam stops to watch
GEORGE (CONTD)
Twenty years of hating what you live
inwhat you are This is the end of
it Sam Im gonna build something of me

here that I can be proud to give to you

SAM

GEORGE
Do whatever you want with it I dont
care All I want from you is for you to
remember we built this house together

SAM
We havent build shit Youre just
tearing down your father

GEORGE
Try it It feels good

George strikes another blow to the house joined with a MAD
WAIL Sam starts low a whisper of a scream but quickly
builds soon rivaling George in volume as he pounds away
This soul letting cleansing ritual is both impelling and
frightening to watch Tom and Barbara Colleen and her
step out of their houses drawn and perplexed by the
noise

meticulous in their application Alyssa and Sam nail and

bolt the corner posts to the rim joist as Robin and George

work on the stick framed door deck

appears

that the pain is nearly gone As the song ends Robin
rushes

toward the radio

Robin waits to see how worse George finally walks to her
and takes her in his arms He must have been better than

this The waltz smooths out as they dance closer holding
tighter We fill the air with silent stares But still

one there we are strangers Alyssa decides its time to
go
