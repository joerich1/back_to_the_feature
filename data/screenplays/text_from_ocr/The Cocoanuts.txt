BOB
No - its too expensive Now

Berryman was here to see it last

Cally made Palm Beach and Miami

Now when a man like that passes a
Place up no one wants it Do you
know anything about architecture

POLLY
No but Id love to learn

BOB
Well I made a arawing of the whole
Place showing it as a bullt up
scheme without cutting down the
hill or having it get in the way
I made the hill fit in with the
architectural scheme see I sent
Berryman a copy last week and his
secretary wrote me a nice note
Saying they were Studying my plans

POLLY
Thats thrilling Does Mr Hammer
know about it

BOB
Idid But if he takes it I will
design the buildings Say I may
be an architect yet

POLLY
If he only does Im sure it will
be the most beautiful place in the
world

INT HOTEL LOBBY

MOTHER
Well Polly youve been out again
with Mr Adams

POLLY
But only for a little while Mother

MOTHER
Why a daughter of mine should fool
around with a hotel clerk when she
has the opportunity of marrying
one of the Boston Yates - is more
than I can understand

POLLY
Oh who cares about the Boston Yates
Anyway Bob isnt a clerk hes an
architect Hes only elerking until
he can get started

MOTHER
One who clerks Polly is a clerk
- and that settles it And I want
you to remember that no Potter has
ever been involved in a single
scandal

POLLY

MOTHER
Polly its a well known fact that
your uncle was drunk at the time

It is the first time it has ever

MRS POTTER
Im sorry Mr Hammer but Im
afraid --

HAMMER

Do you know that property values
have increased since 1929 one
thousand per cent Do you know

that this 1s the biggest development
Since Sophie Tucker Do you know
that Florida is the show spot of
America and Cocoanut Manor the black
spot of Florida

MRS POTTER
You told me about that yesterday

ge REEL II

HAMMER

I know but I left out a comma
Look in a little while Im going
to hold an auction sale at Cocoanut
Manor the suburb terrible or beauti-
ful You must come over Theres
going to be entertainment sand-
wiches and the auction If you
dont like auctions we can play
contract Here it is - Cocoanut
Manor 42 hours from Times Square
by railroad 1600 miles as the
crow flies and 1800 miles as the
horse flies There you are --
Cocoanut Manor glorifying the
American sewer and the Florida
sucker Its the most exclusive
residential district in Florida
Nobody lives there And the climate
ask me about the climate I dare

you
MRS POTTER

Very well -- how is the -—
HAMMER

Im glad you brought it up Our
motto is Cocoanut Beach no snow
no ice and no business Do you
know that Florida is the greatest
state in the Union

MRS POTTER
It 1s

HAMMER
Take its climate -- no we took
that - take its fruits -- take
the alligator pears - take all
the alligator pears and Keep ‘em --
see if I care Do you know how
alligator pears are made

MRS POTTER
Havent the slightest idea --

HAMMER
There you are Thats because youve
never been an alligator and dont
let it happen again Do you know
that it sometimes requres years to
bring the pear and the alligator
together They dont like each
other

ge

REEL II

MRS POTTER
No

HAMMER
No Do you know how many alligator
pears are sent out of this state
every year and told not to come back

MRS POTTER

feeds the nation but nobody feeds
me and thats what I want to talk
to you about

MRS POTTER

raising Oh I dont mean anything
personal But here is the ideal
cattle raising section We have
long horns short horns and the

MRS POTTER
Mr Hammer will you let me say
something please

HAMMER
I hardly think so and theres
something else I want to bring to
your mind Where will you be when
youre sixty-five Thats only about
three months from now

MRS POTTER
If I were to buy I should prefer
some place like Palm Beach

HAMMER
Palm Beach The Atlantic City of
yesterday The slums of tomorrow
Do you know that the population of
Cocoanut Beach has doubled in the
past week

MRS POTTER
Has it

inch pipe But of course all
property owners will be allowed to
vote on the size of their pipe In

Shirt Song

I want my shirt I want my shirt
I cant be happy without my shirt

He wants his shirt he wants his shirt
He cant be happy without his shirt

I dont want food I dont want drink
Because my feelings are more than hurt

He dont want food he dont want drink
He dont want anything except his shirt

Except his shirt
How can a man be happy without his shirt
Without his shirt

How wont you tell me how
Can a fellow flirt

Without his shirt

How can a fellow make love to a pretty
skirt

Without his shirt

Oh life ig not worth living without
his shirt

Tell us about it Tell us about it

Listen Ah -- ah -- wont you listen
Ah -- aah
To a story Its a shirt tail Just a
shirt tail
Its the tail -- the tail of a shirt
I want my shirt He wants his shirt
I want my shirt He wants his shirt
Not his hat not his tie not his shoes
Covered up with dirt —
Not his coat not his vest not his pants
But he wants his shirt

He wants his shirt he wants his shirt
He wont be happy t111 he gets his shirt
He wants his shirt He wants his shirt
He wont be happy till he gets his shirt

Hes got it Hes got it Hes got it
