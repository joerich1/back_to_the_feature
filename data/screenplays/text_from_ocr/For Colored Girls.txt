OPENING

INT COMMUNITY CENTER - YASMINE’S DANCE STUDIO - DAY 1

The community center is an old run down building with two
floors and several different rooms Built in the 50’s it
looks like it hasnt been kept up or painted in years
Water spots and old creaky floors line the hallway The
center is housed in a state funded facility with several
other volunteer operations Juanita’s free clinic and
Yasmine’s Rhythms a dance studio are two of them We
enter the dance studio where Yasmine is dancing alone We
see soft shots of her hands and feet dancing about the
room The fabric from her yellow leotard move gracefully
in the wind as she dances to the sound of a solo piano
The slow speed of the film catches her face in the light
from the huge old dirty window The entire scene is ina
sepia tone with the yellow very noticeable

YASMINE (VO)
Dark phrases of womanhood
of never having been a girl
Half-note scattered without
rhythm

INT JUANITA’S APARTMENT - DAY 2

stands in the kitchen of her modest apartment watering a

hundred flyers printed The flyers read “Free Clinic
Seminars on Thursday”

JUANITA (VO)
No tune distraught Laughter
fallin’ over a black girl’s
shoulders It’s funny It’s
hysterical The melodylessness of
her dance Don’t tell nobody
don’t tell a soul She’s dancing
on beer cans and shingles

must have known women relinquish
all personal rights in the
presence of a man who apparently
could be considered a rapist
especially if he has been
considered a friend And is no
less worthy of being beat within
an inch of his life Being
publicly ridiculed having two
fists shoved up his ass
Then the stranger we always
thought it would be who never
showed up Cause it turns out the
nature of rape has changed
We can now meet them in circles we
frequent for companionship
See them at the coffeehouse
with someone else we know We
could even have them over for

wazn’t lame white or noddin out
Look at you You let your thigh
slip from under your skirt crossin

examined I saw you I watched you
sullen And the rhinestones
etching the corners of your mouth
suggested tears fresh kisses that
had done no good You always wore

crying The ghost of another

missing I wanted to jump outta my
bones and be done with myself
Leave me alone and go on in the
wind It was too much I fell into
a numbness til the only tree I
could see took me up in her
branches held me in the breeze
Made me dawn dew that chill at
daybreak the sun wrapped me up
swingin rose light everywhere the
sky laid over me like a million
men I was cold I was burnin up
A child and endlessly weaving
garments for the moon with my
tears I found God in myself and I
loved her I loved her fiercely
