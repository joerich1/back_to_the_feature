BRAD
Thanks for posting bail Martin

MARTIN
Don’t even think about it This is
all some misunderstanding

PETER DANTE a confident criminal lawyer strides in

PETER
Okay I’ve been in contact with the
DA’s office The charge is
securities fraud They’re saying
you bought a substantial interest
in a Chinese company called Golden
Dragon Mining The company then
tanked and you covered your losses
by transferring money out of client
accounts They’re estimating the
missing funds at over 200 million

Peter hands Brad a file of printouts

BRAD
That’s crazy I never invested in
that company And my fund has made
at least a ten percent profit every
year I’ve managed it
PETER
They’re saying you altered
transaction records to make it look
that way

Brad looks through the printouts

BRAD
These aren’t my investments

PETER
I have to be honest with you Brad
If I was a prosecutor I couldn’t
ask for stronger evidence than
this

BRAD
What are you saying

PETER
We should consider taking a plea

BRAD
Absolutely not

PETER
You risk a much more severe
sentence by going to trial

BRAD
Were going to prove I didn’t make
these transactions

MARTIN
Of course we will We’1ll get the
best investigators money can buy

BRAD
And I’1l take the stand

PETER
If you insist we’ll go to trial
But there’s no way I’m letting you
testify

BRAD
I will testify And I will focus my
mind into a white-hot laser of
truth and convince that jury that
I am innocent

DISTRICT ATTORNEY
Mr Derver is it true that at your
firm you’re referred to as The
Wizard

Brad perks up Finally something good is happening He cheats
towards the jury

BRAD
Yes it is

DISTRICT ATTORNEY
Would you say that’s because the
returns you obtained for your
investors weremagical

BRAD
And wondrous yes

Peter at the defense table frantically shakes his head
DISTRICT ATTORNEY
But as we all know what we call
“magic” is actually an illusion a
trick

BRAD
(realizing too late where
this is going)
No but not mine Mine was real

DISTRICT ATTORNEY
Is it possible you were called The
Wizard because you tricked people

BRAD
No I was a good wizard like in
the Wizard of Oz

DISTRICT ATTORNEY
He was a fake

Sweat is practically raining off of Brad’s body

say that It’s a style of fighting
created by Brazilian slaves to look
like dance so they could fool their
masters

DARNELL
You know that in prison you’re not
gonna have music and mood lighting
right

BRAD
This is a serious martial art

DARNELL

brick Darnell holds a lighter under two spoons showing Brad
how to melt them together

You see they’re almost like one
piece now Then you sharpen the
handle against the brick like
this

Darnell heats the tip of the spoon handles then sharpens
them against the brick He shows Brad the point

DARNELL (CONTD)
You’ve got your blade now And you
use a torn T-shirt to make your
handle

Darnell takes a torn-up T-shirt and wraps it around the
bottom of the shiv

I haven’t gotten to the sharp part
yet but I think I’ve got a pretty
good handle

Brad proudly shows off an intricately carved wooden handle of
a rabbit on its hind legs

DARNELL
How the fuck did you do this

BRAD
I whittled it with a knife

Brad holds up a Swiss Army knife

DARNELL
Motherfucker you ain’t gonna have
a knife in prison That’s why
youre making a shiv

BRAD
Right So make the shiv first THEN
whittle the handle

DARNELL
No No whittling

Darnell grabs the knife from Brad accidentally slicing

A little deeper and you would’ve

needed stitches How’d you do this

BRAD
Darnell cut me

RITA
What

DARNELL
It was an accident I was taking a
knife away from him

BRAD
He didn’t like the shiv I made

RITA
You’ve got him making shivs

BRAD
Part of my training for prison

RITA
So do you feel like you’re learning
anything from Darnell

DARNELL
(nipping this in the bid)
Of course he does
(pointedly)
And I’m only charging him a
thousand dollars a day Come on we
got to get back to it

RITA
He’s had enough training for today
(to Brad)

Youre staying for supper

INT RITA AND DARNELL’S APARTMENT - EVENING

Sitting at the dinner table Glenn shows Brad a cool-looking
website for Darnell’s car-washing business Rita and Darnell
get dinner ready in the kitchen area

GLENN
Now watch this The brushes morph
into little versions of my dad who
get all the spots the brushes
missed

BRAD
(impressed)
You did all this

DARNELL
Little man’s a computer genius

RITA
It’s what got him into his new
school

DARNELL

That and our life savings Okay
put away the computer we’re about
to eat

them down They all

Rita brings in plates of food and sets
jams his fingers in

begin to eat Darnell reaches over and
Brads food

RITA
Darnell what are you doing

BRAD
That’s my fault -- I wasn’t eating

properly
Brad hunches over his food and starts furiously shovelling it
into his mouth Rita watches him quizzically

BRAD (CONTD)
This is part of my training

As he speaks to her Brad looks over her shoulder

RITA
What are you looking at

BRAD
Just trying not to make eye
contact Also part of my training

Brad goes back to eating like an animal Rita shoots a look
at Darnell Darnell relents

DARNELL

(to Brad)
You don’t have to eat like that --

I won’t mess with your food

(admonishing)
Glenn
GLENN

Did you really steal two hundred
million dollars

DARNELL
That’s none of your business

BRAD
No I don’t mind Because I didn’t
do it
(to Glenn)

Managing the money of other people
is something I’ve always taken very
seriously I earned my returns
through hard work but they’re
saying it was through cheating
Imagine if somebody said you didn’t
make that great website for your
dad that you just tricked everyone
into thinking you did That’s
what’s been done to me

After a beat

BRAD (CONTD)
Amazing meat loaf

RITA
Thank you

Brads phone rings He reads a text
BRAD
I’m sorry I have to go -- it has
to do with my case

BRAD (CONTD)
Thanks again for dinner

Brad exits
DARNELL

(calling after him)
Hey man You gotta come back to

prison
RITA

Darnell I don’t think he did it
GLENN

Me neither
RITA

That’s an innocent man you’re
taking advantage of

Darnell looks annoyed this is a responsibility he is
unwilling to accept

DARNELL
Man he’s conning both of you He’s
just another white dude who got
rich by taking other people’s
money

Darnell looks toward the door

DARNELL (CONTD)
That’s a jailbreak right there

COLEMAN
The transactions show your fund

with me

I didn’t do it

MAN IN A SUIT

DARNELL
I’m not a gambler I made one bet

RITA
So what happened to the three
thousand dollars

DARNELL
(after a beat )

DARNELL
Wait a second Where’re you getting
all this information

BRAD
From Martin

DARNELL
That’s like me noticing all the
cookies missing and my son offering
to launch an investigation Talking
about I think the neighbor’s dog
ate them Oh no it was the cat
Wait hold on might have been a
roach conspiracy Ultimately this
investigation will yield limited
results due to the fact that my
son ate the motherfucking cookies

BRAD

What if your boss took that money

BRAD
He would never do that

DARNELL
He’s a rich dude They’re all evil
motherfuckers

came in And he fucked me again
And he made Alissa watch this time
How did he get in the warden’s

fantasies
