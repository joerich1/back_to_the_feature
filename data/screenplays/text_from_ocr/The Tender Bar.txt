A HIT OF THE SEVENTIES (ideally something underwatery here
and not upbeat)

FADE UP ON

INT MOM’S TERRIBLE GREMLINEXT MEMORIAL FIELD MANHASSET
NY DAY (MOVING)

PULLING BACK FROM THE CAR RADIO we see that we are tooling
through period Manhassett and that a Mom (MOM) and her young
son (YOUNG JR) are on a drive the purpose of which is
explained by the CAMERA moving back through the piles of
boxes suitcases lamps and trashbagged gear in the seatless
rear of the Gremlin

REVERSE TO SEE that

YOUNG JR and MOM are on one of their terrible pining drives
pining for stability in the American stand in for stability
the automobile MOM is pretty tired in her twenties a
member of the pioneer generations of single moms

YOUNG JR who head against the window is as ever watching
out over the moving world for father figures maybe his
father and he sees (as the car radio plays a hit of this
very day)

YOUNG JR’S POV (AND THEN VARIOUS)
MEMORIAL FIELD

NINE MEN IN ORANGE SOFTBALL UNIFORMS (a practice team)are
racing around a diamond at Memorial Field The shirts have
THE SILHOUETTE OF CHARLES DICKENS silk-screened in black on
the backs and the shoulders

The Practice is transacted in beautiful light

YOUNG JR in the loaded car is transfixed by the beauty of the
field the heroic stances of the men (various with time
ruptures) spitting drinking beer hitting someone in the
nuts with a hotdog actually playing etc One bald player
stands fiercely and majestically at bat

YOUNG JR
(to MOM)
Wait wait I think that’s Uncle
Charlie
The Tender Bar Wm Monahan 2

YOUNG JR (who can be and will be anywhere from 6-8 during the
YOUNG JR parts of the film) is not an exclamation points
kinda kid but more an optimistic observer daring to be
disappointed

UNCLE CHARLIE takes his swing

An “oh Jesus” eye roll from MOM who looks like she has been
crying but MOM pulls over dutifully parks blows her nose
and nods go see him go As the song stops MOM ina
precautionary way remembers to bash the radio off and
glance over as

EXT MEMORIAL FIELD CONTINUOUS

YOUNG JR as in a state of pure idolatry gets out of the car
and looks at his heroes backlit heroized as hell despite
their vast guts miserable shanks scant hair and almost
complete lack of athletic ability They are practicing--no
need to dress another team

UNCLE CHARLIE the chief GOD now patrols the infield like a
flamingo his sunglasses following first a pitch and then a
hit and then the ball as

STEVE (beer-bellied God of liquor) parks one lit like
Achilles shrouded in his own divine American light

YOUNG JR watches the ball go
LATER

MOM joins YOUNG JR on the bleachers but he is (maybe)
irritated by her he wants to watch his gods the men

MOM understands this that you lose your baby by a million
such cuts (this is a thing that here can be played) she
puts her handkerchief away in her bag

YOUNG JR watches in adoration as we hear various voices off
GUYS FROM THE BAR (0S)
Is that all you got you
cocksucker come on Oh fuck you
Charlie
With equal adoration YOUNG JR spies
THE BEER BARREL filled with ice canned beer lit like the
Holy Grail itself in this childhood magic hour One Magician

is drinking from a dripping can

TWO SHOT JR AND MOM ON BLEACHERS
The Tender Bar Wm Monahan 3
YOUNG JR
Why are those men so happy

MOM
They’re wasted

YOUNG JR looks at her Wasted

MOM (CONTD)

Drunk
YOUNG JR
Oh
MOM
Come on We’re going home We’re
going

(a long beat of distaste
defeat and in CU)
‘home’ Again

She drags away JR by the hand as he is still staring back at
the men and lifting a a wave to

The silhouetted magnificent figure of UNCLE CHARLIE who
insofar as we see his features in the backlighting due an
Aztec god looks querulous

MOMENTS LATER

As MOM AND YOUNG JR head to the car we again and more so see
how loaded it is the roof has a mattress and box spring
piled on it and tied through the windows and sticking out of
the open Gremlin hatch And though MOM has YOUNG JR by the
hand he stares back at the fabulous drunks

And UNCLE CHARLIE not sure who he is seeing stares after
the terrible rust-scabbed car Then he returns to the
gameHis sister returning home is not an unusual thing

And as we go to black and the real opening (as Eighties music
plays) we

FADE UP ON

A TERRIBLE HOUSE ON LONG ISLAND —THE HOUSE”— a dilapidated
Cape in a color unknown to nature its post-war living room
picture window presiding over lushly grassed swamp above the
cesspool It is the Eighties but it feels Seventies the
Many cars in the driveway (as many cars as one would find at
a medium sized apartment building) are mostly from the
Sixties and now another one is added as we MOTOR right and
land on a jalopy (the terrible Gremlin) with its scurfs of
panel rust and a smoking tailpipe
The Tender Bar Wm Monahan 4

In the silence after the engine clatter dies off we hear
suburban birdsong a radio baseball game somewhere a lawn
mower and somewhere further off a dull roar of traffic on the
LIE

TOYS from kids of various ages lie everywhere from scooters
to a crapped out MINIBIKE with no back wheel sitting on a
milk crate

CLOSER ON THE HOUSE AT THE FRONT DOOR as we hear two car
doors close hear the trunk open and close

The FRONT DOOR OPENS and we see GRAMPA the don’t give a fuck
owner of this don’t give a fuck house

What remains of his hair is a wreck he is dressed like a
1940s bad ass auto mechanic and he stands following the
progress of his visitors with his eyes

REVERSE onto GRAMPAS POV

It is MOM and beside her

We MOTOR OVER and TIP DOWN (POV approximation)

Her son a second grader the perpetually seeking but
optimistic YOUNG JR

REVERSE ON GRAMPA

Who wordlessly leaves the door open and retreats into the
house his form of welcome

MOM and YOUNG JR now follow him and MOM her face suffused
with all the regret of another return home comes back from
within to close the door behind she and YOUNG JR and here we
see the PINEAPPLE DOOR KNOCKER the caked paint the metal
stick on sign that says “NO PEDDLERS” And here we

CUT TO

EXT THE HOUSE LATER

DETROIT IRON at its finest becomes first audible and then
visible as UNCLE CHARLIE pulls up to the house in a Chuck
Berry class Cadillac convertible He emerges in his uniform
looks at MOM’s crammed car here it is again

YOUNG JR is looking out the window UNCLE CHARLIE flipping
his KEYCHAIN notices him and gives a thumbs up to the
solemn boy

The Tender Bar Wm Monahan 5

INT DINING ROOM DAY

CLOSE DETAILS as a HUGE EXTENDED FAMILY formed by larger
world failures and marriage collapses commences to feed
itself around a huge dining room table so long that it needs
two different table cloths

The MEAL is what we are on first it is a watery version of

what here in America we call Chop Suey except with bouys of
halved hotdogs in it and sticking out of it accompanied by

WONDER BREAD and MARGARINE

YOUNG JR is sitting uncertainly and it is through his eyes
(handheld and responsive to action)that we see the energy and
violence of the feeding as all adults all of them smoking
feed the two toddlers while everybody else (Kids ranging up
to high school age displaced from various aborted families
with their mothers and back at the grandparents) lays in on
the mismatched plates eating snuffling salting heavily

YOUNG JR scans the KIDS but he is most interested in UNCLE
CHARLIE (mid thirties hung over dramatically entirely bald
still in his Dickens shirt) and GRAMPA as previously
described

GRANDMOTHER does not sit but smoking emerges in her
housecoat with another package of WONDER BREAD drops it and
returns to the kitchen

YOUNG JR and his mother eat (the mother as if she is born to
it as she is and YOUNG JR being observant) No one remarks
their presence It is evidently very usual for refugees to

arrive

UNCLE CHARLIE loading his plate again with the hotdog chop
suey fixing his eye on YOUNG JR winks at him and hands him
5 dollars

GRAMPA has observed this inexplicable act but keeps eating
saving his comment for later

GRANDMOTHER (0OS AND CU WITH A CIG
IN HER FACE)
(throwing dialog away
unheard as she potters
and totters around
kitchen)
I guess you two will be in the
whereisit maybe in there with the
older ones or maybe you can take
him in your roomI don’t know
The Tender Bar Wm Monahan 6

GRAMPA
Everybody needs to know he cesspool
is not taking it so whoever can
take a leak outside do it but don’t
let any son of a bitch see you
especially whats his name

Points with a fork vaguely at neighbors

But when YOUNG JR follows the eye-line indicated by the FORK
his POV lands on a crooked picture of JESUS indicating his
glowing SACRED HEART

To the immediate left of Jesus (do this with a move) is a
HAGIOGRAPH OF JFK TILT DOWN to the SIDEBOARD below these
main pictures and we see that the top of the sideboard is
LOADED with marriage pictures army pictures pictures of
kids kids with kids old people in hats beside jalopies or
wagons the sideboard is groaning with photos some of them
knocked over or displaced by hand tools baseball glove
Readers DIGESTS schoolbooks from various kids at various
ages We are still without conversation still in the clatter
and slurping (again MOM has settled right in resentful and
silent as the trapped teenager she not long ago was) and
since there will be no expository dialog whatsoever here at
this point in the multigenerational Alamo let us say that the
house is inhabited by

Uncle Charlie Aunt Ruth Aunt Ruth’s five daughters and one
son Grandpa Grandpa and now MOM and YOUNG JR who is
watching everything bug eyed as the one alien attendee —and
an alien especially good at observation

UNCLE CHARLIE
Put it in your pocket

YOUNG JR realizes he means the 5 bucks still in his fist

GRAMPA
(chewing)
Whyn’t he put it towards the
‘lectricity I would ask if it did
any goddam good

YOUNG JR confusedly holds the 5 towards his grandfather
GRAMPA stares at him With outrage

GRAMPA (CONTD)
Who do you think I am

Then he ignores YOUNG JR
The Tender Bar Wm Monahan 7

GRAMPA (CONTD)
Like I said all males if you take
a leak take it outside

DOGS skirmish around the table and CAT now picks its way
across the sideboard Via the progress of the cat YOUNG JR
notices

A PICTURE OF MOM and YOUNG JR as a baby A FIGURE HAS BEEN
CUT OUT OF THIS PICTURE We are on it tight when a hand as
if routinely tips the picture over on its face This is
GRANDMA who delivers to the table a SARAH LEE cake

THE MALE COUSIN is staring evenly at YOUNG JR and holding a
Hamster

LATER (THE HOUSE VARIOUS HANDHELD)

Little YOUNG JR looks into various rooms Furniture dating
from the Roosevelt Administration litters of toys a Sears
sofa with a print of American Eagles and liberty bells a TV
with some cousin working the rabbit ears crawling babies
another one screaming in a play pen and ripping at the
railing MOM and RUTH bickering about something off in the
Kitchen and now we are down the hall with YOUNG JR looking
into various rooms and then into (as kids run and screen
doors bang) the sanctum sanctorumUNCLE CHARLIE’S ROOM the
cell of a drinking monk with a book problem A TRANSISTOR
RADIO (always close on the radios in this picture and we
will find out why) broadcasts a horse race while UNCLE
CHARLIE lies biered on his Sunday hangover wearing an eye-
mask reaching blindly for a BUDWEISER unaware of the nephew
looking at him somberly

YOUNG JR continues down the hall and looks into a room where
he sees that his MOM has half unpacked and is sitting and
leaking tears She holds out her arms

He heads towards her As she holds him and after a long beat

YOUNG JR
I like it

MOM
Do you

YOUNG JR

It’s people I like to have people

She hugs him happy for that but in shame and disappointment
that it’s these people again

MOM
Tomorrow is another day
The Tender Bar Wm Monahan 8

YOUNG JR
I like it

CUT TO

INT THE BEDROOM (YOUNG JR AND MOM’S BEDROOM) NIGHT

And it’s not continuous night It’s later (Stuff has been
unpacked) YOUNG JR is wakeful in bed with his also wakeful
MOM They lie in bed like the world’s strangest married
couple And MOM in fact is twisting the skin where her ring
should be

YOUNG JR
Why does Grampa say we should all
clear out

MOM
Because he’s a selfish old prick
who resents taking care of his
family

Long beat

YOUNG JR
Like Dad

Longer beat and complicated

MOM
No honey Grampa resents taking
care of his family Your father has
never taken care of anybody at all

YOUNG JR
Oh

ANOTHER ANGLE

YOUNG JR stained by light from streetlamp coming through
nylon curtains turns his head and looks at

THE BEDSIDE RADIO a big bakelite one in midcentury green
with a dial that is probably radium He just stares at it and
has not even reached for the radio when his mother
(anticipating his compulsive action) says

MOM
No
The Tender Bar Wm Monahan 9

YOUNG JR is used to this thing with the radio (being asked
not to turn it on) and he lies back philosophically On a
music cue from the song that is to follow and JR’S face we

CUT TO

INT THE KITCHEN DAY

WE are on the KITCHEN RADIO (another post WW2 number) as Aunt
Ruth does dishes and various perhaps all members of the
household go back in forth in the giant Altman film that is
every crowded working class house

The RADIO is playing “Working my Way Back to You” YOUNG JR
is sitting at the table eating cereal with his cousins All
is normal until the song ends andoff the alarmed eyes of
MOM and GRANDMOTHER

AUNT RUTH lashes out with soapy hand and cracks the off
button a good one just as a low awfully good very Seventies
male radio voice says
THE VOICE

This is Johnny Michaels The Voice

and that was Workin
CRACK THE RADIO is off perhaps even destroyed and the
whole FAMILY is silent pretending this incident never
happened returning to its activities of washing pouring
milk scratching eating smoking and not communicating
YOUNG JR sits over his cereal spoon poised

YOUNG JR
That was my father

THE RADIO hits the floor
Everyone continues eating

AUNT RUTH (0S)
No that was a radio

UNCLE CHARLIE more alert than the rest is staring through
his hangover at JR

UNCLE CHARLIE
Eat your cereal

UNCLE CHARLIE eats his

EXT THE BACK YARD LATER

UNCLE CHARLIE smoking has a deck of CARDS and is teaching
YOUNG JR some game or other dealing from a buckled deck

UNCLE CHARLIE

(shuffling and squinting

through cigarette smoke)
You were very young when your
father left so you probably don’t
know that your father is an
asshole But your father is an
asshole

(holding up a lectorial

finger)
Not just because he left because
people can leave without being an
asshole no one knows what is in
the human fucking heart or any
given fucking relationship trust
me but I’m saying your father’s an
asshole not because of any specific
action but because he’s an asshole
Even in repose

(speaking now around

fuming cigarette and

dealing)
One of the ways he’s an asshole is
he can’t handle his liquor

YOUNG JR listens gravely This could be serious male
information

UNCLE CHARLIE (CONTD)

Can’t Handle His liquor
(deals)

That’s the base root and cause of
Many accidental assholes If you
can’t handle your liquor you can be
an asshole accidentally However
your father was not an asshole
accidentally He’s an asshole who
can’t handle his liquor Also
Listen if you’re not going to be
any good at cards I will stop
teaching you

YOUNG JR
Don’t stop teaching me Please

UNCLE CHARLIE
Two rules I don’t let you win If
you beat me you beat me but I
don’t let you win
The Tender Bar Wm Monahan 11

YOUNG JR nods

UNCLE CHARLIE (CONTD)
That way you get a jump on life By
tasting defeat You don’t suck at
sports but I was watching you out
in the yard You’re not very good
at sports and won’t get better so I
suggest other activities to avoid
disappointment tears above all
delusion What do you like to do
most

YOUNG JR
Read

UNCLE CHARLIE
I read However I can also play
sports Listen here’s the thing
about the radio You’re gonna look
for your father in the radio You
think your father is in the radio
He is at least on the radio But he
is an asshole who is on the radio
Don’t try to play sports and don’t
think your father is going to save
you Youll do fine That’s all I
have to say The game is 5 card
stud

YOUNG JR looks at him and we

CUT TO
INT THE BEDROOM NIGHT
We are CLOSE ON
AND CLOSER ON
THE BEDSIDE RADIO until it fills the screen
YOUNG JR face lighted by the radio reaches out and turns
the dial One of the old bandaid-colored earphones is in his
ear and we are hearing what he is hearing” the squelching
search between stations of varying strength as he looks for

THE VOICE He hears someone coming and smashes the radio off
and pulls the covers up and pretends to be sleeping
The Tender Bar Wm Monahan 12

EXT THE HOUSE DAY

MOM is looking for THE VOICE in her own way Dressed for her
(new) secretarial job she rummages in the MAILBOX then
bends and looks deep into the MAILBOX then closes the

MAILBOX deliberately These are things that a single mom can
play She exits the shot and we hear her car start

INT MOM’S CAR CONTINUOUS

MOM starts to reach for the RADIO Then doesn’t Son of a
bitch She puts the crap car into gear and heads off to work

INT THE BEDROOM DAY

YOUNG JR lies on his bed with hands propping his chin He is
staring at the RADIO The radio isn’t on

YOUNG JR
(To dead RADIO)
Mom could use some money

There is strange raking light effect

YOUNG JR (CONTD)
She’s really tired after work

CLOSER ON THE RADIO
YOUNG JR (CONTD)
(a long beat)
I’m starting Little League
CLOSER until we dissolve THROUGH the RADIO and we

CUT TO

INT METRO NORTH TRAIN CAR DAY

On the face of a young man (JR in his twenties dressed for
INTERVIEW DAY) rocking North towards New Haven lost ina
study of the past His books and coat and backpack and gear
and some books and notebooks are spread out He pulls in his
legs and sits up as A PRIEST looms

PRIEST
Is this seat taken

JR moves to accommodate him
The Tender Bar Wm Monahan 13

The PRIEST removes his Homburg and sits down and licks a
thumb to turn a page of his newspaper

PRIEST (CONTD)
What are you thinking about young
man

JR
The past

And we cut to MOMENTS later (leaving the Priest place-set and
JR losing himself in memory again) and as JR looks out the
window again we

CUT TO

INT UNCLE CHARLIE’S ROOM DAY

UNCLE CHARLIE has a blinder of a hangover and is lying in bed
in heroic endurance of light pain dehydration there in his
book-filled bachelor’s flop He rips a Gatorade with a
grunt from a bag that YOUNG JR and then holds out his hand
for the change

UNCLE CHARLIE
You tell your cousin I said you
could ride his bike It’s not his
bike anyway It’s a house bike I
found it at the dump and fixed it
for all you little assholes And
they’re going to Colorado It’s
your bike Oh holy Jesus mother of
God

YOUNG JR
How did you get sick

UNCLE CHARLIE reopens one eye like the wall eye of a whale

UNCLE CHARLIE
I’m not sick It’s Saturday
morning This is the way it is For
men This is Saturday morning As
it is for men

He sits up wretchedly

YOUNG JR
Oh

UNCLE CHARLIE
Take this money back go get me
cigarettes at the bar
The Tender Bar Wm Monahan 14

THE PHONE RINGS
UNCLE CHARLIE stares at it warily Pop eyed

UNCLE CHARLIE (CONTD)
Get the phone before your
Grandmother gets it I’m not here

What

UNCLE CHARLIE (CONTD)
That means you say I’m not here
even if I am Oh Jesus

YOUNG JR
(answering)
Hello

Crackling silence And then the 1970s forced complacent
basso Ted Baxter voice with that affected and region-less
TVRadio accent and false forced bass that characterized
minor players in USA broadcast media decades ago

THE VOICE
Hey I know there are plenty of rug
rats there at su casa is not mi
casa but I’m wondering if this is
UR

Long crackling silence

YOUNG JR
Dad

UNCLE CHARLIE opens an eye warily

UNCLE CHARLIE

UNCLE CHARLIE
Gimme the phone

YOUNG JR

YOUNG JR

YOUNG JR
Wow OK Great Thank you

JR nods
YOUNG JR

THE VOICE

Bye now Remember six thirty

The VOICE has a coughing fit and we hear a girl asking where
her other shoe is as THE VOICE hangs up

YOUNG JR replaces the receiver UNCLE CHARLIE stares at him
somberly Starts to say something Then fuck it not his
business He goes off on his own business

YOUNG JR is in a rapture

UNCLE CHARLIE

INT A METRO NORTH TRAIN DAY

JR is remembering this in pain looking out the window his
forehead on the glass as he was as a child with the car with
Mom

JR (VO)
He said be ready at 630 I was
ready at 430 So as not to fuck
up You always remember fucking up
So you don’t want to fuck up

CUT TO

EXT THE HOUSE DAY

YOUNG JR has his METS CAP on he has his Dave Cash mitt and
he is watching every car that approaches the house — and then
passes by

JR (V0)
The thing is that day I felt like I
had fucked up That’s the thing to
remember about a kid The kid
thinks that he has fucked up

YOUNG JR scans the street watches in both directions
watches cars that do not stop already losing heart but not
wanting to go there yet

JR (VO)
My mother hadn’t saved any pictures
of my father and he was cut out of
the pictures they had at the house
so I didn’t know what he looked
like and I hadn’t been to New York
City yet to see his face on
billboards and buses I couldn’t
have picked him out of a crowd But
I wondered if it was like a thing
you would always know As if you
would always know your father
instantly It was possible

YOUNG JR as the light fades keeps watching

CUT TO

EXT THE HOUSE EARLY EVENING

YOUNG JR is still sitting there and a light has come on in
the house GRANDMA looks out decides to leave the boy alone
The Tender Bar Wm Monahan 18

ON SOUND on the summer air we hear that the Mets game has
started and that it is playing on the radio We hear it from
several houses

YOUNG JR sits there his face covered with tears and then we
DO hear a car and we hear it shut off and we hear
footsteps and we stay on YOUNG JR until the right moment to
reveal that MOM is standing and looking at him

There’s nothing to say The boy with the hat and the glove
whose father hasn’t come

She sits beside him Stay on him

MOM
We’re the two musketeers Right
We’re the two musketeers

He nods crying silently

CUT TO

INT A METRO NORTH TRAIN DAY

JR looking out the window head against the glass More than
ten years later he sniffs rubs his eye looks philosophical
the same optimism of the tiny boy

UNCLE CHARLIE (VO)
(over bar sounds)
Because what are you gonna do

INT THE DICKENS DAY

UNCLE CHARLIE bartending at The Dickens is behind the bar
owning the bar in motion polishing glasses pouring drinks

UNCLE CHARLIE
Shit or wind your watch Call it a
day or run for fuckin president I
ask you

NO STEAMBOAT CAPTAIN OR KING has ever been more resplendent
than UNCLE CHARLIE behind the bar with its dazzling
glassware and bottles its carved masculine wood its central
shield with the silhouette of Dickens on it

UNCLE CHARLIE is laughing with friends and now he notices
something makes a Coke from the gun pops two cherries into
it
The Tender Bar Wm Monahan 19

And SLIDES IT COWBOY FASHION DOWN THE BAR (we are on the
glass) to

To YOUNG JR who is right there at the bar up on his knees
on a stool doing his schoolwork— a bit— but mainly watching
UNCLE CHARLIE and the thing about the Dickens (revealed as
UNCLE CHARLIE moves) is that the shelves have as many books
as bottles In fact BOTTLES AND BOOKS compete for shelf
space

UNCLE CHARLIE (CONTD)
Yeah there are books Bar is called
the fuckin’ Charles Dickens OK so
what do you need me to do

YOUNG JR
Mom can’t go to something

UNCLE CHARLIE
(very seriously)
Can’t go to what

INT SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST’S OFFICE DAY

UNCLE CHARLIE pissed off sits there holding his hat YOUNG
JR beside him on the psychologist’s couch

PSYCHOLOGIST
How can do you think I can help

This is a weird question since he called the meeting

UNCLE CHARLIE
Someone said he was having
tantrums I think you said he was
having tantrums His mother’s at
work she’s a secretary she’s
busy why don’t you tell me what
this is about

PSYCHOLOGIST
The boy won’t tell me what his name
stands for

UNCLE CHARLIE
His name is JR It doesn’t stand
for anything Deal with it

The PSYCHOLOGIST makes a note

UNCLE CHARLIE (CONTD)
Look this is a weird time for me
to say I’m not a Psychologist
The Tender Bar Wm Monahan

PSYCHOLOGIST
Why do you say that

UNCLE CHARLIE
Because I’m sitting here with a
Psychologist who maybe knows I’m
not a psychologist What are you
inert OK I get it you have this
thing going on where nothing is
face value and no one is as smart
as you and you sit there and wait
for errors of fuckin baseline
perception or something I get it
We all have our jobs This is
yours Knock yourself out

He looks at his watch

PSYCHOLOGIST
JR those are his initials

YOUNG JR sits there

UNCLE CHARLIE
Or the contraction for Junior What
the fuck’s the difference

PSYCHOLOGIST

Well there’s a very big difference
if it is being concealed from him
that he is a Junior because there
is no Senior in his life

UNCLE CHARLIE
ListenHe Might not have ever
thought that until you decided to
unveil your fucking bullshit on the
subject That’s what I think
Listen do you want the Socratic
method from me on you and all your
works Cos I’1l do it I’1l tell
you what I think and you’ll be
strapped to a stretcher

PSYCHOLOGIST
Can you explain that

UNCLE CHARLIE
What I said is what I meant Are
you out of your fucking mind
The Tender Bar Wm Monahan 21

PSYCHOLOGIST
It is my belief that the
uncertainty about the meaning of
his name and the continual
questions about it have left him
without identity

UNCLE CHARLIE
Oh He has no identity Hence an
identity crisis

PSYCHOLOGIST
He has no identity which causes
rage

UNCLE CHARLIE
He has dubiety about his identity
supposedly Seems like a normal kid
to me Seems like a normal person
Are you sure about your identity

CLOSE ON UNCLE CHARLIE

UNCLE CHARLIE (CONTD)
The absence of his father seems to
really interest you You cast it as
a negative but let’s be
seriousYou’re having a kid in
her traumatizing him And you’ve
been asking his mother to dinner

The PSYCHOLOGIST trapped

PSYCHOLOGIST
II1

UNCLE CHARLIE
Youll scare and traumatize a kid
so you can hit on his mother

Long silence

UNCLE CHARLIE (CONTD)
OK we’re leaving

And he gets up and before he does the next thing (which is
probably hitting the psychologist) we

JR who catches it

MOM
Girls become wives and mothers was
his point of view

GRANDPA (0S)

MOM

Shut up you old turd

(to YOUNG JR)
Because he is stingy with love and
understanding is why I have no

INTERCUT GRANDPA

He is his chair and has a beer

GRANDPA (0S)

YOUNG JR is wondering now if he can eat his sandwich

UNCLE CHARLIE
(coming through in his
underwear to get a coke)
What to make up for your
disappointments

MOM
Harvard or Yale

GRANDPA (0S)
Harvard or Yale This from a woman
who earns thirty bucks a day

MOM

Yale you’re going to law school
The Tender Bar Wm Monahan 24

GRANDPA (0OS)
So you can sue you father for child
support

MOM
So he can help you with your fines
about the septic tank

She kisses YOUNG JR lingeringly on the head Then grabs her
stuff and heads out to work

UNCLE CHARLIE sits down drinks his coke reflectively lights
a butt and mumbles over it

UNCLE CHARLIE
She’s wrong about college but we
can’t tell her She needs to
believe it Simple people need to
believe in college They’re
vulnerable Look at him in there
Is there any difference if he
didn’t go to Dartmouth I ask you

YOUNG JR
Yes I mean no

THE VOICE realizes that this might be weird territory where
he might be asked to step up in some way

THE VOICE
Yes or no

YOUNG JR
I mean I like it but Mom doesn’t

THE VOICE
Your grandfather’s a good man
Marches to his own drummer I like
that about him

YOUNG JR
Mom says he might have lost his
mind

THE VOICE

Well there’s that also Sometimes
your own drummer is a bad idea

YOUNG JR
It makes Mom sad having to keep
going to Grampa’s house
The Tender Bar Wm Monahan 26

THE VOICE
And blames me

No answer from YOUNG JR

THE VOICE (CONTD)

Women sometimes don’t think things
through about cause and effect
They want freedom but they get it
and they blame you for dispensing
it That’s my experience One
swinging dick to another I can
give that to you

(with narcissistic

pleasure)
Your mother says you listen to your
old man on the radio a lot

INT A METRO NORTH TRAIN DAY

YOUNG JR is still heading North to New Haven the PRIEST is
snapping through the broadsheet paper and eyeing the
troubled young man periodically

JR (V0O)
A little while later after being
arrested while on air for non
payment of child support The Voice
paid a fraction of what he owed and
fled the state Years later I
learned that it was about this same
period that he called up drunk and
said he had put a contract on my
mother’s life He also threatened
to kidnap me but Uncle Charlie
thought this was a less serious
threat as kidnapping comes with
responsibilities Still I was
warned to never go with my father
if I ever had the chance

INT THE DICKENS DAY
UNCLE CHARLIE has a shiner and cut lip and cut knuckles

UNCLE CHARLIE
I believe in full disclosure Your

INT KITCHEN DAY

YOUNG JR sits tensely as the family reads THE FAMILY GAZETTE
which is pretty much what it ought to be at breakfast Each
present member of the family (director’s choice but
definitely UNCLE CHARLIE MOM GRANDMA GRANDPA) reads their
copy with an intensity of attention or lack thereof that
reflects their characters Reckon there is a range from
“reading anything at breakfast” to crapulous objection YOUNG
JR watches from a distance with an artist’s anxiety

MOM
This is wonderful JR
GRANDPA
“Family Gazette” This is no
family
GRANDMA
Not with you in it
GRANDPA
This is like seagulls on my

paycheck

Uncle Charlie decides to take THE FAMILY GAZETTE seriously
He decides perhaps that the work in itself is serious enough
to take seriously Then he throws the Family Gazette down
into a plate of egg yolk
The Tender Bar Wm Monahan 34

UNCLE CHARLIE
OK I’d avoid the drawing Just
leave that out Here it is I know
a lot of people who think they are
writers In most cases—you will
find this in life-they are not You
don’t wanna be one of those guys
trust me There are seven eight at
the bar Everybody has a pen
everybody has some paper everybody
had to write something at some
point so they think oh if I had
TIME if I fuckin knew somebody
etcetera How do I phrase this
don’t be one of those guys Like
Bob at the bar

GRANDMA
Who’s Bob

UNCLE CHARLIE
A man tied to a sled of self
delusion and illiteracy going down
a hill of irrelevance OK first
you have to have “it” whatever it
is You have to have it immediately
or you don’t have it I say you

disgusting But there it is

UNCLE CHARLIE leaves for the day—carrying the doors They are
no longer needed The books have been exposed

YOUNG JR stares at the pirate treasure

UNCLE CHARLIE (0S) (CONTD)
(to MOM)
Don’t look at him when he’s having
a private personal moment Jesus
it’s pathetic Mom used to look at
me when I was shaving You know
what I did I grew a beard So
she wouldn’t look at me with
“wonder” and “love” when I was

on the softball field at the beginning of the film This is
also a ritual the man thing that has to be learned

We expect big things from JR

GRAMPA
Our educational system and indeed
our society as a whole was
destroyed in the 19th Century by
the German influence

MRS WILLIAMS

Ability as a concept turned into

everything derives from two epic
poems—the Illiad and the Odyssey
Handily contained for you in one
book edited and translated by —

the two seedlings the poyims
three thousand years old from
which all literature grew

He comes back behind the bar and his movement reveals JR JR
is slumped on the bar with an empty glass in front of him

UNCLE CHARLIE
Sambuca

Speechless assent from JR who is failing to light a
cigarette

UNCLE CHARLIE (CONTD)

Your insecurity

(pouring)
Your problem is you started with a
seven-two two different suits

(incomprehension from JR)
A seven and a two different suits
worst poker hand possible Who’s
nephew are you You had a bad hand
Your friend Bayard over there owns
the casino

JR
I’m just a fish out of water
The Tender Bar Wm Monahan

UNCLE CHARLIE
The first rule is if someone is an
asshole and puts you down never
take it seriously If somebody
makes a big thing about social
position it means they don’t have
it They’re nervous

JR
Like Bayard’s father I asked him
where he went to high school
because of the way he asked me and
he like shit himself I said it the
way you would have Sssh Bayard
knows his old man’s a dick though

UNCLE CHARLIE
Perfect riposte If people are
making you nervous trying to make
you nervous ever wonder if it’s
possible you make them nervous
Ever wonder what a legacy at Yale
really feels deep down When they
see a man like you Good looking
kid threat to their women their
positions no advantages seven-
two there on ability only

JR is briefly intrigued by that

UNCLE CHARLIE (CONTD)
A seven and two as the worst hand
in poker is almost impossible to
recover from But what cards do you
play If you’re dealt the seven and
two

JR
The seven and two

UNCLE CHARLIE
The idea of social classes is for
unmarried women closet drinkers
with lots of cats They buy those
books about being ravished by
noblemen Scott Fitzgerald was kind
of a cat lady in his own way he
believed all kinds of shit Anyway

proposition is a Scholastic
progression of the self evident

JR

UNCLE CHARLIE
(grabs JR by the collar)
You get into Yale on a seven and
two and you “don’t wanna”

JR stares at him

UNCLE CHARLIE (CONTD)

When you got nothing

He takes away JR’s drink

UNCLE CHARLIE (CONTD)

JR
He likes you He thinks I’m a dick
And a pussy

BAYARD
No he thinks you’re in danger of
being a dick and a pussy Two
different things So are a dick and
a pussy

JR
I’m not pretending I’m inadequate
I am inadequate I’m unequalI
don’t understand Henry the Fifth
Part one I don’t know what they
are saying

BAYARD
Don’t be a fucking knucklehead
Watch the movies until you can
understand it Read it aloud

JR looks at him as if he is an oracle

BAYARD leads the way on towards into the party Then he
stops

SIDNEY is there The GIRL FROM CLASS

SIDNEY is beautiful an undergrad and for college well
dressed cashmere leather coat She is leaving the party out
of disinterest

thinking he is a dick and a pussy who can’t understand
Shakespearebut he rallies and extends his hand

JR

(voice too high)
Youre in my

Sidney nods

SIDNEY

JR

especially since she seems to be adding a triple meaning

JR
It’s weird that you know who I am

SIDNEY
What’s wrong with you

JR
Not so good in there The party

She shakes her head Looking at him steadily and politely

SIDNEY
No

JR

resource he did not know

BAYARDS what the fuck expression is priceless

She nods
The Tender Bar Wm Monahan 75

JR and SIDNEY gain the sidewalk and head off

BAYARD sits on the steps of the party house knifes open a

JIMMY

BAYARD

JIMMY can’t process this

JIMMY
No he feels too inadequate

BAYARD

inadequate Until they want you to

EXT NEW HAVEN LATER

drinking porches and chained bicycles

SIDNEY

SIDNEY
(taking his arm)

JR thinks about that Then emphatically

JR
Yes

SIDNEY
Father-based

He stares at her stunned
The Tender Bar Wm Monahan 76

JR
I’m named after my father but I’ve
only seen him a couple of times
but he was always on the radio in
New York he’s Johnny Ace or
Johnny Michaels on the radioAnd
my name kinda means “Junior” but
junior to what

SIDNEY
Are you in search for your father
Obsessed in any way

JR
No of course not

SIDNEY
This is me

She means the apartment house they stand in front of As he
fumbles with cigarettes and remembering to offer her one
(which she takes)

JR
Asking details about people is all
wrong I’ve frequently made that
mistake Excuse me if I havent
asked enough questions People have
been asking me to stop

SIDNEY
It’s ill-bred to ask a lot of
questions but it’s all right to
ask some

JR
Yeah but everybody tells me to calm

down

She directs him to sit on the stoop and then sits beside
him

JR double takes on this He waits for Sidney’s Mom to make a
joke but she doesnt

“Dwelling”

JR
What

SIDNEY
A magazine called Dwelling

JR
Ah some people don’t “dwell” They
just fart in houses And live in
them Without having lists of
enthusiasms

SIDNEY’S MOM
I don’t think you should dwell on
it

JR

SIDNEY’S MOM
I understand you have an absconded
father who is nothing more to you
than a voice on the radio

JR looks at SIDNEY SIDNEY shrugs

JR
In effect yes

SIDNEY’S MOM
Are you in psychotherapy I should
think you would be

UNCLE CHARLIE is being very serious

UNCLE CHARLIE
This has to be about you it can’t
be about the girl Where is she

JR
She’s in the villageShe has an
apartment Withhim

UNCLE CHARLIE
In the list of things that you
don’t have that she has what do
you also don’t have now

JR
An apartment in New York

UNCLE CHARLIE
Don’t write to the girl that you’ve
improved yourself Whatever you do
You’1l blow the power and majesty
of her finding out

Head in hands

JR
I already did

UNCLE CHARLIE
Jesus God will you come to me
about these things Don’t let her
know you want her back Did you say
that

JR nods hopelessly
UNCLE CHARLIE (CONTD)
Have you gone and stared at her
fucking building In the rain and
shit
INTERCUT
JR staring at SIDNEY’S BUILDING In the rain and shit

JR
No
The Tender Bar Wm Monahan 108

UNCLE CHARLIE
Listen JR She’s abandoned you how
Many times

JR looks at him

UNCLE CHARLIE (CONTD)
Don’t you look at me If someone
abandons youwhat does that mean
You of all people

JR
She’s just needs Time

UNCLE CHARLIE
I think that you’ve missed the
point that girls decide If they
want something or don’t want
something it becomes very obvious
very fast

JR
But

UNCLE CHARLIE
Girls decide

JR
I know but

UNCLE CHARLIE
Girls decide When she met you who
decided

JR
She did

UNCLE CHARLIE
There you go Numb nuts Standard
pattern obvious to all Do you see
a pattern
(after it has sunk in
shouts to bar)
JR got hired by the Times

CHEERS go up along the whole bar

JR
I’m a copyboy I get sandwiches I
separate carbons it’s nothing
it’s nothing
The Tender Bar Wm Monahan 109

But the DRINKS come anyway The guys start pummeling his
back And then they lift him in his bar stool throne He is
riding up there when he sees coming through the crowd MOM

The guys put him down

JR (CONTD)
Yeah I got hired by the New York
Times

They embrace and the whole bar cheers

CUT TO

INT TIMES EDITORIAL OFFICE DAY
The EDITOR is a Timesman through and through

EDITOR
So your first byline presents a
problem Initials cannot be used
without periods

JR
I’ve done some research Harry S
Truman did not use a dot after his
middle initial

EDITOR
It is not called a “dot”

JR
And ee cummings noperiods

EDITOR
By God the Times gave them periods
anyway And do you know why
Because it looks like we forgot
Times style is Times style and you
are J period R period Maguire —

JR
Period

EDITOR
There is no period after a last
name

Gazes at JR
The Tender Bar Wm Monahan 110

EDITOR (CONTD)
Allow me to convey my compliments
on this fine work You have a
byline in the New York Times

The editor scratches a note in a folder Puts the corrected
copy into the OUT tray where it is snatched up

And then looks at JR

EDITOR (CONTD)
Good day

JR
Oh

He leaves in a daze

CUT TO

INT GRAND CENTRAL OYSTER BAR DAY

Noise Trains being announced BAYARD is three sheets to the
wind

BAYARD
So you’re promoted

JR
No I’m promoted when I become a
full-fledged reporter

BAYARD
And Sidney will be sorry

JR
When my byline appears every day

BAYARD
And you still don’t have the
background she’s looking for

JR takes that on

BAYARD (CONTD)
And are mainly blossoming as a
barfly
(a beat)
Genetics is tough Incidentally
where is the Missing Link now The
deus absconditus
The Tender Bar Wm Monahan 111

JR
Somewhere South

BAYARD
Youre being like your mother about
Yale You think the Times means
something

JR
So what does mean something

BAYARD
A book With a book you can go
years before you realize that
doesn’t mean anything either
Nothing means anything either
immediately or eventually And
whatever you do Sidney will still
never call out of the blue to get
you back Do you know why

Oddly enough THE PRIEST is visible in the crowd below JR
watches him go For some reason the Priest who sees him
HOLDS UP HIS WRIST AND TAPS HIS WATCH FACE After this scrap
of metaphysical (which may be just drinking)

JR
Why won’t Sidney ever call Genius
who knows everything

BAYARD
Because she doesn’t love you
Because she dumped you like nine
times Because she’s getting
married on Memorial Day

The WAITER comes up
BAYARD (CONTD)
In retrospect what you do next is
going to be important
JR
Four gin martinis up with a twist
made with a tiny drop of Scotch

CUT TO

INT THE DICKENS SAME NIGHT

JR is at the bar and he has a copy of the Times with his
byline in it
The Tender Bar Wm Monahan 112

He smashes it up in his hands into a ball and lofts it into
the trash bin behind the bar under the DICKENS PORTRAIT

UNCLE CHARLIE
Two

JR sucks down a huge part of his ongoing drink and claws
open the book he is reading now A FAN’S NOTES He looks at
the PIC of Exley who even looks drunk in his Author photo
He starts reading

WELL DRESSED PERFECTLY OK STRANGER
What are you reading

JR shows the cover as if it is a challenge

WELL DRESSED PERFECTLY OK STRANGER (CONTD)
What’s it about

JR

It’s never what it’s about It’s
how it’s about it If you don’t
know that don’t ask people what
they are fucking reading What a
book is about is the same thing
that life is about Love and pain
and death and disappointment

UNCLE CHARLIE

(wary of the pending fight

but deciding to ignore

it)
Fred Exley was forced to use the
subtitle a fictional memoir I
think after his publisher went
looking for character clearances

WELL DRESSED PERFECTLY OK STRANGER
Do you want to step outside

JR
I’m not gay

He is clubbed off the bar stool with one right hook and then
is on the floor among his books and papers

UNCLE CHARLIE comes over the bar in a practiced way

THE WELL DRESSED PERFECTLY OK STRANGER leaves by the main
door

JRS MSS papers and notebooks are everywhere and he gathers
them together bleeding onto them from his fauceting nose
The Tender Bar Wm Monahan 113

UNCLE CHARLIE
(with bar rag)
Stand up and put your head back

JR
(still bleeding on the
floor)
Sidney’s getting married

UNCLE CHARLIE
Expect nothing and never be
disappointed and you’ll always be
surprised What do I always tell
you Don’t try to be on a team
that’s not picking you

CHIEF
That guy had every right to clock
you

JR

I know he did
JR sits back on his stool holding the bar rag to his nose

CHIEF
You acted like your father

JR looks at him over the bloody rag

UNCLE CHARLIE lays BLOODY MANUSCRIPT and NOTEBOOKS ON THE
BAR

UNCLE CHARLIE
Pop quiz First line of “The Ginger
Man”

JR
“Today a rare Sun of Spring”

UNCLE CHARLIE
Second question Is it a good
opening line

JR
-It’s a Joyce knockoff Not very
good Really

JIMBO
I have read The Ginger Man Not
impressed
The Tender Bar Wm Monahan 114

UNCLE CHARLIE

(pouring a pint)
Dunleavey goes over to fuckin
Ireland starts dressing like
Victor McLaglen in The fuckin Quiet
Man has a blackthorn stick is
writing in Joycean fuckin pastiche
Strangely it’s big with the Irish
And nowhere else Who the fuck
knows about anything You can never
tell

GIVES JR another bar rag this one a bundle of ice

UNCLE CHARLIE (CONTD)
If she’s getting married take the
win It’s over with

JR nods

UNCLE CHARLIE (CONTD)
People write best when their
heart’s are broken It’s
scientific

CUT TO

INT TIMES NEWSROOM DAY

JR is still a copyboy still separating carbons And one of
the carbons is

“In Westport CT Sidney Lawson and Robert Devereaux
Hollingshead”

Fuck
He throws it away Then picks it up and is holding it when

COPYGIRL
He’s looking for you

JR looks over at the EDITOR visible behind his glass wall He
adjusts his tie retucks his shirt Hesitates Stares at the
floor Then heads over Momentous momentouson this of all
days

COPYBOY
(passing)
Could be it lucky bastard Byline
boy
The Tender Bar Wm Monahan

JR keeps heading towards the bumf-crammed aquarium of the
editorial office EDITOR gestures at him to enter and he
does EDITOR gestures at him to close the door and he does
EDITOR gestures at him to sit and he does

JR nods

JR waits

EDITOR

As you know the editors have had a
chance to carefully review your
work and it’s terrific Truly
some of the pieces you have done
have been outstanding

(a beat)
Though many of them have been about
people in bars on Long island

EDITOR (CONTD)
Some of the pieces have indeed
been truly outstanding

EDITOR (CONTD)
That’s why I wish I had better
news

MOVE IN ON JR

The EDITOR looks a bit taken aback

EDITOR (CONTD)
As you know when the committee
meets to consider a trainee some
editors voice support some do
not

JR
Is it based just on writing Or is
it a lower upper middle class
thing

EDITOR
(evading this—confused by
it-still benign)
A vote is taken and I can’t tell
you who voted how or why but the
end result is that I cannot offer
you a position as a reporter

JR
Thank you

as if he was not clear
The Tender Bar Wm Monahan 116

EDITOR
The feeling is that you need more
experience A smaller newspaper
perhaps where you can learn and
grow

JR
No Thank you

AS JR heads back to his station taking off his tie he sees
the COPYGIRL holding out the receiver of a phone

CUT TO

INT A HOSPITAL ROOM DAY

JR sits listening to the beeping of Monitors and looking
at UNCLE CHARLIE Uncle Charlie is asleep gray and
terrible

UNCLE CHARLIE opens one eye

UNCLE CHARLIE
Don’t look at me like that They
say it’s minor

JR
It’s a heart attack

UNCLE CHARLIE
It’s probably possible to kill me
but it’s not easy What’s up

JR
They didn’t offer me a position

UNCLE CHARLIE
Pure gold All that means is all
those assholes are now characters

JR
I guess so

UNCLE CHARLIE
And this itself is a dramatic
incident You can inflate it

JR
OK What if I made it where I
realize something important
The Tender Bar Wm Monahan 117

UNCLE CHARLIE

(ignoring this)
I’m not a hundred percent sure you
should go memoir but we have to be
conscious of the trend

(a beat)
If there’s gonna be any structure
you know what you have to do

JR
He’s in North Carolina doing a
talk show

UNCLE CHARLIE
Your father once came to Manhassett
to talk to your mother Seeking a
rapproachment He came on the
train he didn’t have a car By the
way in America you can’t have a
rapproachment with any chick
whatsoever if you don’t have a car
You can’t do anything You know
that

JR
Youve told me yes And stashies
in the wallet

UNCLE CHARLIE
Maybe things are different in the
future of transportation or in
Holland or some shit but in
America have a car Your mother
had already told him to fuck off
He comes in the bar he drinks well
scotch neat Never drink well
scotch and never drink it neat
It’s a signal that you are nearing
the end and in his case that was
20 years ago I loaned him thirty
bucks Which I have not seen to
this day As I get older all I can
remember about him is that voice
That set of pipes And I always
wondered about him if he was
really underneath it all a good

guy

After a long scared beat JR

JR
Do I remind you of him
The Tender Bar Wm Monahan 118

UNCLE CHARLIE thinks about that one and what to say good
and hard

UNCLE CHARLIE
Lighten up on your drinking

CUT TO

EXT NORTH CAROLINA DAY

Establish a low-rent chain restaurant near an active airport

INT CHAIN RESTAURANT CONTINUOUS

JR is sitting reading making notes in a book and suddenly
sensing something he looks up at

THE VOICE

THE VOICE still looks great barely gray-templed He has made
an entrance and knows it

THE VOICE
(whole registers deeper
than natural)
Give your old man a hug

JR does and perhaps perhaps THE VOICE finds real emotion
in it They sit back down and THE VOICE stares at his kid

THE VOICE (CONTD)
Well Thanks for making the trip

He is looking for the waitress JR looks at him looking for
the waitress

THE VOICE (CONTD)
I don’t know if I told you on the
phone but I allow myself to have a
cocktail from time to time

JR
I thought you were

THE VOICE
Are you

JR has no real answer to that he wants a drink himself
The Tender Bar Wm Monahan 119

THE VOICE (CONTD)
(to waitress)
Double Scotch whatever the well
is couple rocks splash of water
no fruit

He looks at his son His son looks at him JR looks at the
WAITRESS

JR
I’m fine

THE VOICE
Don’t fuck with me he’1ll have what
I’m having

JR
What do you mean

THE VOICE looks at him as the WAITRESS goes and we are
allowed to think here that THE VOICE is really at base or
has become a really scary degenerate fucker There are
things wrong in the show-biz presentation A bit of matter at
the corner of his mouth Eyes yellowish color bad A little
bit of not-all there Something crazy in the machismo

presentation
THE VOICE
I make the rules unless you can
take me
JR
What
THE VOICE

You wanna take me on for being a
shitty father Ill give you first
shot

He lights a cigarette and has a coughing fit

JR
Mom is good

THE VOICE for a moment doesn’t seem to process who that might
be

THE VOICE
(very much looking for the
waitress and his drink)
Yeah I’m letting myself enjoy a
cocktail from time to time

He has begun breaking BREADSTICKS
The Tender Bar Wm Monahan 120

THE VOICE (CONTD)
I forgot to tell you on the phone
I’m letting myself enjoy a cocktail
from time to time See I realized
I’m not really an alcoholic Yeah
It’s good When the mood strikes
me now and then I can enjoy a
cocktail

The drinks arrive and some demon in THE VOICE makes him
wait and watch as JR picks his up first

THE VOICE (CONTD)
You can enjoy a cocktail with your
old man

He touches glasses and watches JR take the medicine before
taking his own

THE VOICE (CONTD)
So what are you doing

JR
I’m a writer I have a job at the
Times

THE VOICE

How’s your mother

JR
She’s all right

THE VOICE drains the glass Then sits there as if waiting for
the fizz effect as if with a science fair volcano

THE VOICE
We’re gonna eat over at Kathy’s
she’s the new poontang

JR stares evenly jaw set
THE VOICE (CONTD)
Her daughter’s twelve not entirely
sure it matters down here

Coughing fit gesture for another drink

THE VOICE (CONTD)
That’s a joke Come on
The Tender Bar Wm Monahan 121

EXT A NORTH CAROLINA ROAD DAY

THE VOICE is driving a genuine piece of shit car the car of
a man at the end of his radio voyage

INT THE CAR CONTINUOUS

JRs feet are up to the ankles in empty beer cans and pints
in the foot well

JR
How’s the talk show

THE VOICE
Well you know the Talk Show as it
is down south it’s all about
saying nigger without actually
saying nigger

JR cannot believe he heard that
THE VOICE looks at him

THE VOICE (CONTD)

Lighten the fuck up Sometimes you
don’t pick the tune you sing for
your supper SPORT

(a beat and then from

some suddenly accessed

memory )
They say best men are molded out of
faults And for the most become
much more the better For being a
little bad

He holds out his working PINT JR takes it and unable to
stop himself has a drink

THE VOICE (CONTD)
Maybe you never sang for your
supper

JR
No my mother was singing for it

THE VOICE
Oh it’s one of THOSE Maybe one of
these days I’1l tell you about your
mother

JR
And what would that be
The Tender Bar Wm Monahan 122

And unexpectedly

THE VOICE
How much I loved her

Is this craft Is it real is it situation management JR
stares forward

THE VOICE (CONTD)

Here we are As a Yale graduate
youll love this As you swan
around as a Yale man I hope you
always remember you come from a
long line of scumbags and a house
that needed to be donated to
science

(a VERY COMPELLING GRIN)
Only fucking with you

He turns into a side dirt road and pulls up in a cloud of
dust at a shotgun shack made as nice as it could be which
isn’t very A GIRL’S BICYCLE leans against the porch steps
THE VOICE finishes his pint as if it is medicine necking it

THE VOICE (CONTD)
I allow myself to enjoy a cocktail

JR looks and sees that KATHY has come out on the porch a
poor southern woman painfully thin and troubled Her
daughter very plump stands beside her in the door KATHY is
white and the daughter biracial

EXT THE YARD CONTINUOUS
THE VOICE gets out of the car more than half in the bag

THE VOICE
Hello Honey

KATHY
I see y’all started the party

before I met you just as your
party started long before you met
me but now I just enjoy the
occasional cocktail This is my

This is my son UR

KATHY prods her daughter behind her and inside

KATHY
What’s the JR stand for

The eternal question

THE VOICE
Junior

JR would rather be anywhere and anyone else

KATHY looks for alliance in his eyes Sees if anything only
regret and trauma and apology She stands aside and opens the
door wide for whatever next is going to happen

KATHY
Very pleased to meet you JR

CUT TO

INT THE SHOTGUN SHACK LATER

It is pin-neat and poor But KATHY who is probably no slouch
of an alcoholic herself is fixing drinks THE VOICE is off
having a slash JR sits at a linoleum table admiring the
Daughter’s ongoing JIGSAW PUZZLE which is from of all
things a Canaletto painting

DAUGHTER
Momma shellacks them and puts them

up

Indeed there are Fine Art jigsaws framed along the walls
each of them a longing for somewhere else

JR
That’s Venice

DAUGHTER
I know It’s on the box Have you
ever been there

JR
Not yet

A very serious question

DAUGHTER
How do you get to go places
The Tender Bar Wm Monahan 124

JR

(looking around

helplessly)
WellDo well in school Do very
well in school That’s the first
thing I had to I couldn’t see
anything elseSometimes it’s all
there is

DAUGHTER
I am good at school

JR
If you do very well at schoolno

He looks like he is going to burst into tears He looks at
his drink

THE VOICE holding a finished drink is staring at him
Something flushed and dark He is unsteady

JR (CONTD)
What’s wrong

THE VOICE
(not ready to “go” yet)
Nothing

But he turns

THE VOICE (CONTD)
You probably write like nuns fuck

He goes into the kitchen As it “starts” we stay on JR as
THE DAUGHTER gathers up her PUZZLE on its board and the box
of pieces and leaves the room

THE VOICE (0S) (CONTD)
Let me cook honey

KATHY
I already cooked Can’t you smell
it It’s a chicken

Rattle of ice glug of liquor
KATHY (0S) (CONTD)
I don’t need any of your mood

swings after the day I had

THE VOICE (0S)
What kinda day do you have
The Tender Bar Wm Monahan 125

PUSH IN ON JR

THE VOICE (CONTD)
Really what kind of day could you
possibly have

THE VOICE is cutting limes with a back woods kind of
kitchenskinning knife

KATHY
I don’t want no mood swings with
your son here

THE VOICE
(low so as not to be
heard though he is
heard)
Sucking cock behind the WashnFold
to pay for your fuckin chicken

JR stands up
He hears

KATHY (0S)
Don’t touch me Leave that alone

JR walks towards the door He gets to the door and sees his
father looking at him deliberately and clumsily almost
falling sweep the chicken off the stove it crashes to the
floor in hissing grease and for the first time JR sees An
OLD WOMAN looking out of a back bedroom with terrified eyes

THE VOICE Looks at JR with that belligerence from earlier
but now worse more insane

THE VOICE
(advancing on him)
You look like you had a
breakthrough of some kind You look
like everything’s falling into

place

JR
Shut the fuck up and get ready to
go

THE VOICE
Nowhere to go this is where it
happens

(really having forgotten
from just a second ago)
What did you say to me
The Tender Bar Wm Monahan 126

JR
I told you to shut the fuck up

THE VOICE
Can’t shut me up I’m The Voice
I’m a broadcast professional

THE VOICE shoves JR

THE VOICE (CONTD)
Didn’t want to shut me up when you
were looking for me on the radio
dial

Shoves him again

THE VOICE (CONTD)
Can’t shut your daddy up What
would you do without the wisdom
that you need to be you because
you are me—

Shoves him

THE VOICE (CONTD)
And I am The VOICE and I knowI
knowthe appledon’t fall far
from the tree

He starts to shove JR one handed and JR catches the right
wrist with his left and

With every ounce of strength hits THE VOICE

There is a sucking sound of a dislocated jaw but the VOICE
for a moment doesn’t react He stares in wonder for a moment
Then a thread of blood runs from the corner of his mouth
Then he staggers and falls trying to hold onto JR’s shirt
various other objects and then he is down

JR
I said shut the fuck up

He picks up his drink and gets down on his knees by his
insensible father

JR (CONTD)
See this You have it You have all
of it

He pours the drink into the mouth of the choking half
conscious VOICE
The Tender Bar Wm Monahan 127

JR (CONTD)
You have all of it You can enjoy a
cocktail these days

He picks the bleeding and now old man up by his shirtfront

JR (CONTD)
I’m not your son

KATHY
He won’t hurt nobody he can stay

JR
Do you even know if a drunk throws
a chicken on the floor and starts
trouble you can call the police
Do you even know

KATHY just stares at him

JR (CONTD)
Well you can You don’t have to
take people like him You don’t

EXT THE MAIN ROAD DAY

BLUE LIGHTS are sparkling through the trees as JR comes out
on the main road holding the old man’s CAR KEYS which he
throws into the woods A COP CAR comes out THE VOICE slumped
in the back of it THE VOICE is carried away to god knows

where

JR walks the main road A second COP CAR pulls up

beside him

INT THE AIRPORT NIGHT

It’s after the last flight Shops are shuttered The floor is
being cleaned by a kind of Zamboni driven by an old man JR
sits on one chair of an empty row of them staring into
space thinking about everything

EXT THE DAY AT THE BEACH REPRISE

UNCLE CHARLIE wading chest high with his drink looks back
at JR standing on the beach oblivious He stares back at
his nephew with a greater degree of consideration than we
have ever seen him do He seems to be planning something We
have never seen UNCLE CHARLIE look at the boy with concern
But he is

YOUNG JR surges through the sparkling water towards the
happy floating men of the bar

INT THE DICKENS DAY

UNCLE CHARLIE is back at work a little grayer a little
slower still smoking a Marlboro But he looks at it and puts
it out

UNCLE CHARLIE
Your mother’s settled She’s
selling insurance Somebody has to
sell insurance and some of them
are happy Probably

JR is sitting at the bar

UNCLE CHARLIE (CONTD)
I think Yale kinda took care of her
anxieties It’s not up to me to
judge what she’s looking for But
Id sayshe’s all right

JR nods barely staring at the bar
The Tender Bar Wm Monahan 129

UNCLE CHARLIE (CONTD)
Why’s all your stuff here

JR looks around at what UNCLE CHARLIE has indicated

And it is all there all his stuff a couple of suitcases a
duffel the typewriter

JR
Manhattan It’s time Bayard has a
place

UNCLE CHARLIE
Manhattan’s stupid You need
somewhere to get a job so you can
write

JR seems to agree that this might be right but has no ability
to deal with it as shattered as he is

UNCLE CHARLIE (CONTD)
It’s America Pick something
(nods at gear)
Is that everything
JR nods
UNCLE CHARLIE holds something out

We see
