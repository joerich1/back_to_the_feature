JACK drives up to his house and parks out front of it He
sits there for a few moments

INT JACK’S CAR - AFTERNOON

Jack is looking at himself in the rearview mirror of his car
Its night time and he looks worn from a long day at the
office

EXT JACK’S HOUSE - AFTERNOON - CONTINUOUS

He slowly exits his car attempting to brush off the stress
of the day by plastering on a smile

He walks up the walkway to his house and opens the front
door

INT JACK’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON - CONTINUOUS

The house is dark but candle lit in a sensual and romantic
way

JACK
Honey sorry Im late Long but
productive day at work

Jack tries to sound positive A laugh is heard coming from up
stairs

JACK (CONTD)
Kendra is that you babe

Jack thinks the laugh belongs to his daughter KENDRA 12
There is no response from upstairs

He notices rose petals on the staircase and starts putting
two and two together He begins walking up the stairs while
taking off his suit jacket and tie

JACK (CONTD)
Hun you didn’t tell me you got a
sitter for Kendra You really
outdid yourself this time

(CONTTNURFD )

Jack reaches the top of the stair case and sees a TV
flickering in his daughter’s room behind the slightly ajar
bedroom door There is giggling behind the door

Confused he pushes the bedroom door open only to find his
wife MARCY sitting Indian style on the floor wearing a face
mask made out of the skin from Kendras face

Sitting next to her is KENDRA whose face is completely
skinned off but still fully functioning playing with her
toys She turns to look back at her father

KENDRA
Come play Doll House with us daddy

The TV makes a loud noise and a 13 flashes on it Jacks
watch displays a 1313 on it

Suddenly Marcy screams and lunges at Jack violently Jack
falls back trying to avoid his rabid wife His watch starts
beeping

HARD CUT

INT TENT - MORNING

surroundings

remember where he is (on a camping trip with his closest
friends)

He shakes off the dream and exits the tent

around a camp fire They are all drinking beers

campfire

JOE

Oh yea So the dog had killed my
neighbor’s rabbit So after I
panicked a little my girl said
that we could cover it up See the
neighbors were out of town and they
just had this generic white rabbit
So I rushed to the store and got
another and put it in the cage
Figured they would be none the
wiser

Trevor starts laughing Encouraged by Trevor’s laugh Joe
continues with more excitement Jack seems to be drifting
off

JOE (CONT’D)
So that’s not the best part The
best part is a few days later Mr
And Mrs come home I hear a blood
curdling scream like the wife was
being attacked or somethin’ So I
rush on over only to find her
standing in front of the cage
pointing at that damn replacement
rabbit and just sobbin

shaken from his dream

bedroom Instead he is standing in his living room however
it doesn’t look like his living room The paint on the walls
is slightly peeling and smeared in blood On the walls are
three giant 13’s

The strangest thing Jack sees is Candace the woman who was
in the room next door standing in the center of his living
room and crying

The walls around her as well as the floor are beginning to
deteriorate as if the house has been set on fire

Jack is drawn to her He starts to walk towards her He
reaches out his hand to her

CANDACE
Help me Jack

Jack keeps reaching for her but it seems like something is
holding him back His legs are stuck in the ground and the
room is stretching

Jack turns to look at the windows A mob of people run
towards the window and start banging on them loudly

She continues drawing smaller circles within that circle as

they talk

TREVOR (CONTD)

KENDRA

Shocked Trevor stares at Kendra with his mouth wide open
She continues drawing After a few seconds Trevor decides to
respond
TREVOR
Where did you learn that kind of
language

Kendra doesn’t respond She just keeps drawing She has grown
pale and quiet

KENDRA
He said you like little kids

Trevor is shocked by what he is hearing He tries to respond
but doesn’t know how to

TREVOR
I don’t think he meant

Kendra cuts him off
KENDRA
Don’t think he meant that you like
to fuck little kids

Trevor is beside himself but very nervous

TREVOR
How would he

(CONTTNURFD )

Kendra cuts him off again

KENDRA
Well do you want to fuck me
Trevor

Trevor grinds his teeth He quickly slaps Kendra in the face
She is shocked He then slaps her again and again and
again With each slap he slips deeper and deeper into a
violent rage His hand slowly begins to morph from a slap to
a fist Suddenly he realizes what he is doing and he stops

TREVOR
I am so sorry Kendra

As if in a trance Kendra moves over to being positioned
right in front of her circle target She looks up at Trevor

KENDRA
I can play too

She suddenly starts vigorously banging her head into the
center of the target on the concrete Shocked Trevor tries
to stop her

TREVOR
Kendra no

He grabs her from behind and tries to drag her away She
seems a lot stronger then she should be Trevor has trouble
pulling her away

TREVOR (CONTD)
Kendra stop

Trevor tries to even harder to stop her She throws her hand
back at him and scratches him in the face He gets her to
stop Her forehead is bloody from banging it on the concrete
She head butts him in the face busting his nose open

ACT 4

INT HOSPITAL ROOM 13- DAY

Jack is sitting watching his wife lay in bed She wakes up
Excited Jack sits up more in his seat

JACK
Baby you’re awake

Marcy looks at him

(CONTTNURFD )

JACK (CONTD)
You gave me such a scare The
doctor hasn’t said anything yet but
the EMT in the ambulance thinks you
might have had like a heat stroke
or something

Marcy reaches her arm up towards Jack

JACK (CONTD)
Just relax baby

Jack leans in and kisses her on the lips

JACK (CONTD)
Don’t worry Kendra is back at home
with Quentin Joe and Trevor I’m
sure she is worried sick about you

Jack reaches into his pocket and pulls out his cell phone
Marcy groans a little bit

JACK (CONTD)
I’m just going to call the guys and
get Kendra on the phone I’m sure
she want’s to talk to her mommy

Jack dials and puts the phone up to his ear Jack goes up to
the window and waits as the phone rings Behind him we see
Marcy slowly getting out of her bed She begins to gain
speed

Marcy has snuck up behind him The phone call is cut short
however when Marcy goes into a murderous rampage and tries to
kill Jack

Marcy begins clawing at Jack Jack tries to defend himself
He throws his hands up to block her scratches

JACK (CONT’D)
Marcy stop

Marcy becomes more violent and starts throwing punches at
Jack Jack moves forward and she connects with a punch to his
cheek Jack quickly wraps his arms around her in a bear hug
immobilizing her arms

JACK (CONTD)

Baby calm down Why are you doing
this

(CONTTNURFD )

Marcy then tries to bite him on the neck Jack notes her
trying to bite him so he moves his hand to block her bite
freeing her other hand She grabs him by the throat and tries
to choke him

Jack pushes Marcy away from him with force sending her body
into the window The window shatters behind Marcy She turns
around to look at the broken glass

JACK (CONTD)
I’m sorry baby I didn’t mean to
push you that hard We need to get
you some help

She looks back at Jack for a few moments and smiles She then
Jumps out of the window

JACK (CONT’D)
Marcy no

Jack runs towards the window but it is too late Devastated
Jack looks out of the window and sees his wife dead on the
ground three floors down

Jack collapses onto the floor He is a mess He starts
screaming and hitting the ground Tears are rolling down the
side of his face Suddenly the doorknob to the room starts
jiggling again Jack pulls himself up off of the ground

JACK (CONTD)
Who is it

There is no answer Jack wipes off the tears on his face with
the sleeve of his shirt Some blood comes off on the shirt as
well Marcy must have connected with his face harder then he

remembers He stares at his sleeve for a few moments puzzled
The doorknob starts jiggling more vigorously

JACK (CONTD)
What do you want

There is still no answer

JACK (CONTD)
They can’t hear me Of course they
can’t hear me

Jack begins calming himself down and walking towards the door
slowly The jiggling of the doorknob suddenly stops Puzzled
Jack moves towards the door even quicker He slowly grabs the
knob and turns it

INT HOSPITAL HALLWAY LEVEL 3 - DAY

Jack opens up the door A horrified expression comes across
on his face The door quickly closes behind him and locks
The CAMERA pulls back to reveal blood on the hospital floor
and walls people dead on the ground and a mob of crazy
people quickly approaching One of the people in the mob
stabs another person in the mob

JACK
Holy shit

Jack quickly turns around to barricade himself back in his
room but it’s locked

Panicked Jack turns around only to see the violent mob of
crazy people are briskly approaching He slowly backs away
inching to the side

Jack picks up speed and gets in front of another patient room
door

JACK (CONTD)
Help
The Mob is very close by now Suddenly an arm reaches out
and grabs Jack from behind and immediately pulls him into

another hospital room She locks the door and the people
start banging on it

INT CANDACE’S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
Jack spins around from the door and sees Candace standing
behind him He quickly grabs a stool from the ground to try
and fend her off A dead body of a young boy Jimmy is laying
on the hospital bed in this room
CANDACE
Don’t worry I haven’t lost my mind
like everyone else

Jack gets less tense

CANDACE (CONTD)
You can put the stool down

Jack slowly lowers the stool and then stops

JACK
Well what about him

Jack points to the dead body in the hospital bed

(CONTTNURFD )

CANDACE
Don’t worry about him He’s dead
Been dead for a few hours

Jack slowly lowers the stool and places it on the ground

JACK
How did he die

Candace tries to think
CANDACE
People are going crazy and killing

each other

JACK
I can see that But why

Jack recognizes her from his dream
JACK (CONTD)
Wait Do I know you Like have we

Jack begins to look worried

JACK
Then I need to go to the house and
rescue her

CANDACE
I’m not going anywhere She is
probably affected and so are your
friends

JACK
What makes you say that

CANDACE
Because it seems like we are the
only people unaffected by this
epidemic and it seems to have
affected younger people faster

Jack looks confused

JACK
What makes you say that

CANDACE
Because of my nephew

Candace looks very upset

JACK
What happened to your nephew

CANDACE
I brought him to the hospital today
because he had fallen out of his
tree house

(CONTTNURFD )

the door to call a nurse When she opens the door instead of
seeing a nurse sees Everyone outside attacking one another
Horrified she closes the door As she backs away from the
door horrified Jimmy is behind her He is holding a scalpel
He slashes her arm

Candace screams in pain and spins around When she sees Jimmy
she is shocked and confused by his actions

CANDACE (CONTD)
What are you doing Put that down

Jimmy lifts the knife up into the air

CANDACE (CONTD)
Jimmy put that down

Jimmy walks closer with the knife as Candace circles away
towards the bed

CANDACE (CONT’D)
James

Jimmy screams and runs at Candace She dodges him and he
falls onto the bed He slashes at Candace again marking her
other arm

Jimmy tries to stab her again but Candace deflects his arm
He looks at the blood on the tip of his knife

(CONTTNURFD )

face

nephew She cradles a makeshift bandage on her arm as Jack
listens to her speak intently

CANDACE
He tried to kill me what was I
suppose to do He had gone crazy I
had to defend myself

Jack turns to look at the dead boy in the hospital bed

JACK
That ain’t your fault

CANDACE
Yes it is Because of the choices I
made and the path I set forth my
nephew is no longer with me And he
will never be with me again And

next to

A MALE NEWS ANCHOR is giving the news Completely drenched in

blood

MALE NEWS ANCHOR
In other news people are becoming
extremely violent and even
suicidal There are riots in the

The Male News Anchor has a huge grin on his face

Suddenly the FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR runs up to him and brutally
stabs him in the neck Blood Spurts everywhere She screams

Then all television broadcast cuts off and the TV goes

static

(CONTTNURFD )

Quentin has finished loading his gun Furious about the look
of the static on the TV and annoyed by the sound he points
his gun at the TV and shoots it

INT CANDACE’S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Candace is sitting down as Jack paces back and forth
throughout the hospital room

CANDACE
It affects everyone differently at
different speeds Some go full
crazy some are only crazy for a
few moments at a time I’m all for
going to try and rescue your kid
but it affects children the
quickest

JACK
The news is full of shit anyway
I’m not crazy so obviously it
doesnt affect everyone

CANDACE
I don’t know that you aren’t crazy

JACK
If I was crazy I would have killed
you by now right

CANDACE
Right

JACK
So at least we know you and I
arent crazy Maybe there are
others My daughter is probably one
of them
Candace shivers

JACK (CONTD)
Are you okay

CANDACE
Yeah just cold

Jacks eyes drift over to the thermostat for the room It is
13 degrees Celsius which is about 54 degrees Fahrenheit

Jack’s eyes flicker

(CONTTNURFD )

JACK
That number

CANDACE
What number

Jack walks over to the Thermostat and fixes it while talking

JACK
13 Everywhere I fucking look I see
a 13 Clocks dreams walls room
numbers and now a freaking
thermostat We don’t even use

Candaces eyes flicker

CANDACE
That’s because today 131313

JACK

The doorknob of the room starts to jiggle

CANDACE
Shit
JACK
What do you mean it’s 131313
CANDACE
You wont believe me if I tried to
explain
JACK

At this point I’d believe just
about anything

The crazy people start banging on the Door even more

CANDACE
Do you think that door is going to
hold

JACK

It’s not going to hold long We
need to figure out how to get out
of here

CANDACE
Any ideas

(CONTTNURFD )

JACK
Well we are three stories up we
cant climb down through the window
We are going to have to make a
break for it through the door

Candace looks very displeased by this response The crazy
people outside are still banging on the door but it is not as
hard

CANDACE
Well there are too many people on
the other side of that door

JACK
We are going to have to fight our
way through

CANDACE
Or we can wait them out

Jack nods

JACK
You’re right At least until we
know they aren’t on the other side
of that door

The banging on the door slows down

CANDACE
But there is no way we can know
that There is no way to see
through the door

JACK
They are slowing down We need to
get out of here I need to get to
my daughter

CANDACE
We have to wait until they stop
banging It’s getting less and
less often

JACK
Do you see anything that we can use
as weapons

CANDACE

I can go rummaging through the
drawers

(CONTTNURFD )

Candace goes towards the drawers and starts digging through
them The banging on the door stops

JACK
Hurry up and find a weapon for us
They stopped banging

CANDACE
I’m looking

Jack notices a mirror on the wall He looks from the mirror
to the door He notices that the door is slightly off of the
ground

CANDACE (CONTD)
I found these

Candace holds up a bunch of medical supplies that could be
used as weapons such as scalpels and other pointed objects
Jack picks up the stool he had picked up when he first came
into the room and smashes it into the mirror

Candace jumps Jack quickly tries to silence her by putting
his finger up to his own mouth making the “shh” motion

CANDACE (CONTD)
What are you doing

Jack grabs a broken piece of mirror

JACK
Getting a piece of the mirror

CANDACE
Why

Jack lays on his belly next to the door

JACK
To see if the coast is clear

Jack slides the piece of mirror underneath the door In the
reflection he sees nothing It looks like the coast is clear

Suddenly a crazy person walks by the mirror and stops The
crazy person is covered in blood and looks directly into the
broken piece of mirror A loud crash is heard in the
distance

CRASHMAKER (0S)
That’s 13 mother fucking kills

(CONTTNURFD )
44

The crazy person covered in blood turns to look in the
direction of the crashmaker

After a few lingering seconds they scream loudly and run
after the crashmaker Jack turns back to Candace and looks at
her

JACK
Coast is clear Let’s go

Candace looks nervous

CANDACE
I don’t know It’s
Jack cuts her off
JACK

I’m leaving this room if you want
me to protect you you have to come
with me I need to save my
daughter I don’t want to leave you
behind but I will if I have to

the gun

Quentin is peering out of the windows A few crazy people are
seen walking around outside in the distance

QUENTIN
The whole fucking world has gone
crazy

JOE

Did you see the news People are

He pauses
JOE (CONT’D)
My stomach hurts why does my

He grabs his side

JOE (CONTD)
Why the fuck am I bleeding

Quentin whirls around and looks at Joe

(CONTTNURFD )

QUENTIN
Shit You are bleeding What

bandage that up

Joe takes his hand off of his stomach and looks at the blood
on his hand

QUENTIN (CONTD)
Joe go bandage it up You are
bleeding bad

Joe just stares blankly at his hand Quentin lifts his gun
and points it at Joe

QUENTIN (CONTD)

Joe Fucking respond to me when I
goddamn talk to you you fuck Go
bandage that shit up before I
fucking shoot you

Joe shakes himself out of staring at his hand and looks at
Quentin

JOE
Keep it the fuck down We don’t
want those crazy fucks to hear you
And it’s fine I’1l bandage it
later It’s not a big deal Just
shut your mouth

Quentin cocks his gun
QUENTIN
Boy don’t you ever tell me what to
do I know you are my brother but
you don’t get a pass for that You
understand

Joe nods

QUENTIN (CONTD)
We clear

JOE
Crystal

There is an awkward pause as Quentin starts to shake with
anger

JOE (CONTD)
Are you going to put the gun down

(CONTTNURFD )

QUENTIN

Not until we are clear
JOE

I just said we were clear
QUENTIN

I wasn’t paying attention Say it

No
QUENTIN

JOE
Keep it down They’1l hear us
It’s like you don’t even care

QUENTIN
You know what You’re right I
don’t even care

Quentin spins around and fires his gun through the window In
the distance a crazy woman hears the gunshot and starts
walking towards the house

Quentin turns around and looks at Joe

QUENTIN (CONTD)
Look alive soldier

Joe rushes up next to Quentin Suddenly on a different
window off to the side a woman starts banging her head on
one of the windows repeatedly until it breaks

Joe quickly turns and shoots her in the head blowing the top
of her head clean off

JOE
I got one

QUENTIN
I am proud of you private

JOE
Really

QUENTIN
I’m about as proud of you as your
girlfriend was the day you got your
redwings soldier

(CONTTNURFD )

JOE
Just happy to be in the battalion
captain

Joe does a salute

Quentin turns to look at Joe and quickly turns back to peer
through the blinds in the window outside He waves Joe’s hand
down without looking

QUENTIN
At ease soldier

More people are seen running toward the house in the
distance

QUENTIN (CONTD)
We have a group of hostiles trying
to ambush our base Now our right
and left flank are protected but we
have to guard the front We don’t
know what they are capable of

One of the crazy people whom are quickly approaching fires
a gun and it misses

QUENTIN (CONTD)
And they have weapons We gotta
board these window up and protect
the club house

Quentin and Joe begin to start the process of boarding up all
the windows

Candace smiles
CANDACE

Candace tenses up

JACK (CONT’D)

Jack leans in towards the door and put’s his hand on the
knob

He shivers His eyes dart back to the Thermostat It’s 13
degrees Celsius again He pauses

JACK (CONTD)
I just fixed that thing

(CONTTNURFD )

CANDACE
What thing

JACK
The Thermostat It’s fuckin 13
degrees again I’m tired of all
these fucking 13’s everywhere

Candace starts backing away from Jack

JACK (CONTD)
Why are you backing away from me

CANDACE
You’re going crazy

Jack takes a moment to calm himself down

JACK
I’m sorry I just am tired of
seeing all these 13’s everywhere
all the time

CANDACE
I know why you are seeing 13’s
everywhere
JACK
I know You told me It’s 131313
CANDACE
It’s important
JACK
Why
CANDACE

131313 The end of the world It
exists only due to a problem within
the Julian calendar leap year
wasnt meant to add an extra day to
the month of February but ever 120
years it was meant to add an extra
month ‘Murtembre’ to the entire
calendar By mathematics today is
131313 the real prediction in the
Mayan calendar of the end of the
world

JACK
How do you know all that

(CONTTNURFD )

CANDACE
I’m kind of a calendar nerd
because of my birthday

Jack laughs

JACK
Well it’s not like I’m gonna get a
better explanation from anyone else
anyway

Candace smiles a little
JACK (CONTD)
So you’re telling me that February

29th was never suppose to exist

CANDACE
Yep

JACK
Just my luck my birthday was never
suppose to exist

CANDACE
You were born on leap year

Candace laughs

CANDACE

JACK

CANDACE
Yea I was born on leap year too

JACK
I’ve never met another leap year
baby before

CANDACE
Me either

They both smile
JACK

affected by this

(CONTTNURFD )

CANDACE
I think so
JACK
Single coolest birthday
ever

They both smile again

CANDACE
Okay I’m ready

Jack nods

JACK
Three

Jack swings open the door They wait a few seconds Nothing
happens

Jack peeks his head outside of the door and looks around
Nothing is out there He turns back to look at Candace

JACK (CONTD)
Alright Coast is clear Let’s go

Suddenly a hand reaches and grabs Jack by the hair Jack
jumps and pulls the person into the room with him revealing
it is the young man ALEX from earlier

Alex is holding onto Jack Jack falls backwards onto the
ground and Alex get’s on top of him Jack turns to look at
Candace who is terrified

JACK (CONTD)
Candace close the door

She tries to close the door but Alex’s legs and Jack’s legs
are in the way

CANDACE
I can’t

ALEX
I’m going to fuckin’ kill you for
what you made me do to my brother
you bastard

JACK
Candace close the door

CANDACE
Your legs are blocking it

(CONTTNURFD )

Jack tries to move his legs but Alex punches Jack in the
face Jack reaches up with his hand holding the scalpel He
swings his arm trying to connect with Alex’s throat or head

Alex quickly blocks Jack’s arm knocking the blade onto the
ground Jack reaches for it but it is just out of reach

ALEX
Naughty naughty That’s just no
fun I don’t like guns or knives
my hands are more personal

JACK
Candace a little help

Alex wraps his hands around Jack’s throat strangling him
Candace runs up behind Alex and stabs him in the back with a
scalpel Alex reaches behind himself to grab the scalpel

ALEX
You stabbed me bitch

Alex reaches down and grabs Candace’s leg making her fall to
the ground She bumps her head a little but nothing serious

Jack has managed to wiggle loose while Alex’s focus is on
Candace He has gotten his knees up to his own chest

JACK
Leave her alone

Alex pulls the scalpel out of his back and raises it in the
air like he is about to stab Candace

ALEX
This is for stabbing me bitch

JACK
Leave her alone or I’11 kill you

Alex whirls his head around to Jack

ALEX
What did you just say to me

Alex leans in close and puts the scalpel towards Jack’s face
Jack smiles

JACK

That if you don’t leave her alone I
am going to kill you

(CONTTNURFD )

Alex looks furious He makes a motion like he is about to cut
Jack But Jack has prepared for this and launches Alex back
with his knees that he had tucked under Alex’s chest

Alex flies backwards and falls on his back Jack scrambles
after him

Jack pushes Alex down while getting on top of him Alex has
the scalpel in his hand still but is slightly stunned

Alexs head is right in the middle of the doorway His arm
with the scalpel is pinned down by Jack but is wiggling to
get free

Alex’s arm manages to get free He swings his arm towards
Jack but Jack blocks it wrist to wrist and grabs the door
Jack takes the door and slams it on Alex’s head Alex’s arms
fall to the ground

Jack repeatedly slams the door on Alex’s head until it is
smashed entirely open Blood has spurted up and drenched Jack
in it

CANDACE
He’s dead Jack

Jack stops slamming the door on Alex’s head and turns to look
at Candace

JACK
You okay

CANDACE
Yeah I’m okay

JACK
Good

Candace looks forward and sees this floor of the hospital
looks empty

CANDACE
Let’s go

Jack stands up he grabs the dropped weapons and leaves the
room with Candace closely following behind

INT HOSPITAL HALLWAY LEVEL 3 - DAY

Blood drenches the hallway Some screams are heard throughout
the hospital echoing and bouncing off the walls no way to
triangulate its origin One of the overhead lights is
flickering

Jack and Candace slowly walk out of the room

JACK
Keep close behind me

CANDACE
Okay

Jack and Candace tiptoe through the third floor of the
hospital Some dead bodies litter the scenery The
receptionist is dead with her throat cut

Jack walks slowly as he approaches the first open door He
waves for Candace to hold position and not follow him in He
presses his body against the side of the doorway and pokes
his head around the corner to see if the room is clear He
turns his head and surveys the room Other then a dead body
on the ground the room is clear of people

Jack takes a deep breath and detaches himself from his wall
cover He turns to look at Candace

JACK
This room is clear

Jack turns away from Candace and starts moving through the
hallway more He waves for Candace to follow him and she
does sticking close to his heels She clutches the scalpel
tightly in her hand In front of Jack one room ahead he
sees a fire axe

JACK (CONTD)
I need a better weapon After I
clear this room cover me and I’11
get that axe

CANDACE
Okay

Jack slides his body up against the doorway of the next room
He peers around the edge of the doorway into the room and
surveys it The room is still but dark All the blinds are
closed Jack turns his head slowly The room is clear much to
his surprise

(CONTTNURFD )

JACK
Clear

Jack and Candace rush up to the fire axe Jack grabs the axe
and moves to the next door It’s closed Jack breathes a sigh
of relief

JACK (CONTD)
This one’s closed Only a few more
till we get to the elevator

Jack and Candace move to the next door It is slightly ajar
Jack presses his body up against the wall next to the
doorway

Jack uses the axe to push the door open He looks in and
surveys the room There is a lot of blood on the sheets but
no body

Jack turns his head and checks the corner of the wall
Standing there pressed up against the wall much like Jack
is MEREDITH she has an amazing body but is wearing the face
of some man she has killed as a mask She screams and lunges
at Jack

Jack takes a step back and swings the axe but misses
Meredith She knocks Jack over and gets on top of him He
drops the axe She is holding a pocket knife in her hand that
is already bloody She takes off the face mask revealing her
own face which is covered in blood

MEREDITH
I’m going to make myself a new
mask

She moves her knife towards Jack’s face

JACK
Get off of me

Jack starts to wiggle

MEREDITH
Hold still It’s not going to come
out right if you keep moving

Suddenly Meredith gets hit in the back with a fire axe
Candace is revealed standing behind her She lets go of the
axe which is still lodged in Meredith’s back

Meredith stands up slowly She tries to reach the axe on her

back but can’t Her arms flail trying Jack stands up and
looks at her for a few moments

(CONTTNURFD )

Jack walks towards Meredith who is still trying to get the
axe out of her back She is screaming in pain

Jack puts his foot on her back and presses forward while
pulling the axe out Meredith falls to the ground when the
axe dislodges from her back

Jack quickly swings the axe and hits her in the back of the
head with it killing her instantly A pool of blood
surrounds her

Jack pulls the axe out of the top of Meredith’s head He then
picks up Meredith’s knife and puts it in his pocket

Jack then turns to look at Candace who seems a bit queasy
from what she has just seen

JACK
Thanks for saving me

CANDACE
We’re in this together right

JACK
Right Let’s get in the elevator
and get out of here
Jack and Candace quickly approach the elevator and press the
button It opens up and they get in
INT HOSPITAL ELEVATOR - DAY

Jack and Candace are standing in the elevator

CANDACE
Well what floor

JACK
Ground level

Candace reaches to press the button and presses it

JACK (CONTD)
Wait

Jack hits the stop button for the elevator A loud buzz is
heard and the elevator stays still

JACK (CONTD)
We need a plan first

(CONTTNURFD )

CANDACE
Ground level

JACK
Yeah

JACK (CONTD)
Where is your car parked

CANDACE
I came here in an ambulance
JACK

Jack looks upset
CANDACE

Candace grimaces
CANDACE

Then how are we going to get out of
this hospital and over to your
house We sure as hell can’t do it
on our feet

JACK
I know that
CANDACE
Well
JACK

Let me think
Candace stands there eagerly waiting
JACK (CONTD)
I got it We need to get a bag And
collect the car keys from all of
the dead doctor’s pockets

Candace looks confused

CANDACE
Why’s that

(CONTTNURFD )

JACK
Because if they are doctors then
that means they drove to work
Their cars must be in the parking
garage

CANDACE
Alright Sounds good to me

Candace reaches to turn the elevator back on

JACK
Hit floor 3

Candace pauses and turns to look at Jack very confused

CANDACE
Why

JACK
Because we should take the stairs
Not only do we have a lot of keys
to collect but also I think we
should go through the hospital on
foot

CANDACE
Um why That’s crazy

JACK
No crazier then going onto a level
we haven’t even checked out What
if the doors open and there are
over a hundred people down there
We would be trapped We have to
sneak through the hospital and
avoid them

CANDACE
Level three it is

Candace hits the stop button and unstops the elevator She
then hits Level 3 on the elevator and the elevator doors

open Jack and Candace slowly exit the elevator

INT HOSPITAL HALLWAY LEVEL 3- DAY

Jack and Candace emerge from the elevator Jack turns and
looks around He see’s the staircase He holds for a second

and then turns back to where the receptionist is

(CONTTNURFD )

JACK
I’m going to get the keys out of
that receptionist’s pocket then we
are going to the stairs

CANDACE
Look for a bag over there just in
case we need to grab a bunch of

them

JACK
Good thinking Here hold on to
this

Jack hands Candace the fire axe

CANDACE
Why

JACK
I already know that side of the
hospital floor is safe If anyone
comes your way you are gonna need
to be able to defend yourself

CANDACE
Or save your ass for the third
time
Jack smiles
JACK

Or that Anyway if too many of
them come get into the elevator and
put it on hold like I did before
Youll be safe in there

Candace smiles

CANDACE
Well what about you

JACK
Ill be fine I got the knife that
woman dropped

Jack reaches into his pocket and pulls out the knife

JACK (CONTD)
See

Candace smiles while clutching the axe

(CONTTNURFD )

CANDACE
You sure you wouldn’t rather have a
scalpel
Jack laughs
JACK

Alright I’m off

Jack runs over to the dead body of the receptionist sitting
at the desk He grabs the receptionist and pulls her back

JACK (CONTD)
I’m sorry about this

He then reaches into the pocket he feels nothing He reaches
into the other pocket There is still nothing Jack looks
back towards Candace

Jack shakes his head

Candace thinks for a moment

CANDACE
Well did you check her purse

Jack feels like an idiot as if he should have thought of
that

JACK
No I didn’t

CANDACE
Well check it

JACK
Well where would her purse be

CANDACE
Under her desk maybe

Jack looks underneath the desk There is a trash can

JACK
There’s only a trash can

Candace thinks for a moment

CANDACE
Well are there any drawers

Jack sees a drawer on the desk and opens it up It just has a
bunch of papers in it He closes it back up

(CONTTNURFD )

There is a second drawer underneath the first drawer Jack
opens it up Sure enough there is a purse

Jack grabs the purse and empties out the contents of it
Among the things that fall out of the purse are a set of keys
and some mace

Jack grabs the keys and puts them in the purse He also grabs
the mace and tucks it into his pocket He runs back over to
Candace

JACK
Let’s go down stairs

CANDACE
Alright

Jack and Candace make their way towards the door of the
staircase They approach the door

Jack reaches and puts his hand on the doorknob and then
pauses and turns to look at Candace

JACK
Stick behind me I’ll go in first

Jack opens the door and enters Candace follows close behind

INT STAIRWELL - DAY

Jack and Candace slowly walk into the staircase Jack closes
the door behind Candace He then looks up the staircase It
looks clear

Jack and Candace start slowly marching down the stairs They
take a few steps down the stairs and Jack peers over the
ledge Nothing below

CANDACE
We’re home free

JACK
Looks like it

STAIRCASE INSANE LEADER (0S)
We’re home free We’re home free

Jack turns to look above him to where the screams came from
He starts to hear a stampede of footsteps

JACK
Candace run

(CONTTNURFD )

Jack and Candace start running down the stairs

STAIRCASE INSANE LEADER (0OS)
Candace run Run girl

A hyaena-like laughter is heard echoing from the top of the
stairs

STAIRCASE INSANE LEADER (0S)
(CONTD)
And they’re off With Candace
taking an early lead followed
closely by random douche bag with
Mellow Yellow hot on the tail

Jack looks back while running He sees a group of five
crazies rounding the corner and gaining on them They are
pushing each other to get ahead

STAIRCASE INSANE LEADER (0S)
(CONT’D)

And it looks like Number 13 is

gaining on Mellow Yellow and

starting to break away from the

pack

Jack and Candace have ran down multiple flights of stairs and
are just about to hit the ground level Jack sees that the
crazy people are very close to them

JACK
Candace open the door

Candace grabs the door to level one and opens it Jack grabs
the pepper spray out of his pocket and covers his face He
sprays it back at the crazies and runs out through the door
taking Candace with him and quickly closing it behind him

The five crazy people start screaming and coughing They fall
down the flight of stairs One cracks his head open on the
concrete staircase Another falls and breaks his neck Jack
effectively immobilized all of them

STAIRCASE CRAZY 1
My eyes
INT HOSPITAL LOBBYLEVEL 1 - DAY
Candace and Jack are standing on the other side of the

staircase door with their backs pressed up against it There
is a wall blocking the main lobby

(CONTTNURFD )

Jack hears some whistling Jack presses his body up against
the wall and starts walking with it Candace does the same

Jack gets to the edge of the wall and turns his head to look
into the lobby In front of him the lobby is dilapidated It
looks as if a train has hit it Trash cans are overturned
Dead bodies litter the ground There are many bodies of
doctors on the ground There is one live woman Jack quickly
sticks his arm out and holds Candace against the wall The
woman is whistling while in the middle of stabbing a doctor
repeatedly in the face She looks in Jack’s direction for a
long hard stare then she stabs the doctor in the face one
more time and skips away She goes to the elevator and enters
it

Jack gets off of the wall and walks into the lobby

JACK
Grab all the car keys from all the
doctors’ pockets and toss them in
the purse

CANDACE
Then what

JACK
Then we are going to have to get
out of here through the front

Jack starts walking towards a dead doctor to grab the keys
from his pocket

CANDACE
And run to the parking garage

JACK
Exactly We cant go back in the
staircase I sprayed mace in there
It hasn’t ventilated I may have
immobilized all those guys but we
sure as hell can’t get through that
cloud of mace

Jack pulls out some keys from the doctor’s pocket and tosses
it to Candace

Candace catches the keys and puts them in her purse

JACK (CONTD)
Nice catch

Jack walks over to the next doctor’s body and starts digging
through his pocket

(CONTTNURFD )

JACK (CONTD)
Anyway we gotta do this quick The
pepper spray is only going to last
on them for ten minutes Fifteen if
we are lucky

Jack finds some keys in the doctor’s pocket and pulls them
out Jack tosses Candace the keys from the dead doctors
pocket

CANDACE
How do you know that

Jack and Candace keep going from body to body grabbing Keys
out of the dead doctors pockets as they talk

JACK
I used to be a cop

Candace pulls keys out of a dead doctor’s pocket and puts
them in her purse Jack walks over to a different dead
doctor

CANDACE
You mean before all this

JACK
No I left the force a few months
ago

CANDACE

And why is that

Jack pulls some keys out of the dead doctor’s pocket and
tosses them to Candace She misses them but picks them up and
quickly places them in her purse

JACK
Nice catch

CANDACE
Don’t try to change the subject
Just talk about it

JACK
It’s a rough subject to talk about
My wife left me because of it

CANDACE
I’m sorry to hear that

JACK
It’s okay

(CONTTNURFD )

CANDACE
Please tell me I want to get to
know you

Jack pauses and looks at Candace Candace pauses as well

JACK
Look lady The world is ending
around us You said it yourself
131313 Mayan calendar the whole
shabang Why are you trying to get
to know me

CANDACE

For all I know you might be the
last person on earth other then me

JACK
Wouldnt it be easier if we didn’t
know too much about each other
Just incase you know

Candace grimaces

CANDACE
Look if something happened I don’t
know if I would want to live alone
in a world full of insane people
anyway

JACK
Honey I’ve been living in one my
entire life

CANDACE
Very funny

Jack laughs Candace is visually displeased She tried to
have a moment with Jack but he rejected her

Jack surveys Candace’s face as she goes back to digging
through the pockets of a doctor in front of her

JACK
Excessive force

CANDACE
What

JACK

I was kicked off the force due to
excessive force

(CONTTNURFD )

CANDACE
What happened

JACK
I dunno It’s a long story

CANDACE
Tell me the short version

Clips and pictures from Jack’s story are INTERCUT throughout
his speech

JACK
My partner Quentin and I had been
staking out this meth lab I sawa
guy come out of the meth lab
wearing a hoodie The perp then
hooked around the corner of the
house and went through a gate into
the backyard

Flash of a clip of the perp walking through the gate into the
Backyard

JACK (CONTD)
I thought nothing of it at first
Figured it was a cigarette break or
something but then I heard it A
faint scream of a woman yelling
“stop it” I got out of the car and
went to check it out Quentin told
me not to told me I was blowing
our cover but I did anyway I ran
towards the house as he radioed in
for backup

Flash of a picture of Quentin on the radio in the background
with Jack closer to camera walking away

JACK (CONTD)
I got to the house and opened the
gate to the backyard gun drawn
There was nothing But I could hear
a woman crying more clearly I kept
walking and got to the edge of the
house and hugged the wall I turned
the corner and saw the perp

Flash of the perp on top of the woman

(CONTTNURFD )

JACK (CONTD)
He was on top of this woman Her
clothes were all torn to shit and
her face looked like it had been
smashed in but she was still
crying Her eyes were swollen shut
but she was still crying

Sound of the woman crying is heard

JACK (CONTD)
I could hear her (Pause) I grabbed
the perp and pulled him off the
woman Then all I saw was red Next
thing I know I’m on top of him and
I’ve beaten his face in with my
bare hands I killed him She was
only 17 years old Girl lives sick
fuck dies I loose my job and my
wife fair trade

Candace smiles

CANDACE
You did the right thing

JACK
I think we have enough keys Let’s
get to the garage

Jack tosses Candace one more pair of keys and she puts them
in her purse They then start walking towards the exit

Jack and Candace get close to the exit and a door opens next
to them A man comes running out towards Jack and Candace

JACK (CONTD)
You have got to be shitting me

Suddenly the stairs door opens and the three surviving crazy
people from the staircase start running towards them They
scream

Candace swings her axe at the guy running at them near the
exit She connects with his neck but not with enough force to
chop his head off The axe is lodged in the side of his neck

Candace quickly pulls the axe out of the side of his neck and
some blood spurts out of the wound The man collapses to the
ground dead

Jack whirls around to look at the three crazies from the
stairs coming to them They are very close

(CONTTNURFD )

JACK (CONTD)
Candacerun Through the door Come
on let’s go

Candace and Jack run through the door The three crazies
follow them shortly after

EXT HOSPITAL - DAY

Jack and Candace run through the outside of the hospital with
the three crazies on their tail

Jack knocks over things in his path in hopes that it will
slow down the crazies but it doesn’t

Jack sees the parking garage and begins running towards it
Candace notices Jack’s change of direction and runs after him
as well

Jack turns around and sprays mace again The three crazies
stop before the cloud of mace can reach them They just stand
there shielding their faces and waiting

JACK
This way

Jack approaches the parking garage and ducks into it Candace
follows

INT PARKING GARAGE - DAY

Jack enters the parking garage in a panic Candace runs in
after him Jack and Candace continue running

JACK

Jack ducks between two cars Candace does the same The three
crazy people now run into the parking garage looking for Jack
and Candace They stop to look around and then slowly start
walking

the car sounds going off

all

STAIRCASE CRAZY 2

stands there for a brief moment and then swings down and
grabs Candace

The two crazies start laughing Jack is trying to devise some
sort of plan as he surveys the situation

STAIRCASE CRAZY 2

Jack is about to move out from behind the car Staircase
Crazy number 3 is dragging Candace as she screams

Staircase Crazy 2 pulls out a knife from his pocket He hugs
Staircase Crazy 4 and rams the knife repeatedly into his
body Staircase Crazy 4 falls backwards on to the ground

with his knife grasped tightly in his hand Staircase Crazy

Candace looks at him

STAIRCASE CRAZY 2 (CONTD)

Staircase Crazy 2 lets go of Candace and walks over to
Staircase Crazy 3

Jack emerges from behind the car and starts walking towards
Candace Candace notices him and starts inching towards him

Staircase Crazy 2 is fixated on Staircase Crazy 3
Staircase Crazy 3 notices Jack moving towards Candace He is
about to say something and takes a step forward towards
Staircase Crazy 2

Staircase Crazy 2 stabs Staircase Crazy 3 repeatedly in the
chest and then in the head before he is able to tell him that
Jack is getting Candace

STAIRCASE CRAZY 2 (CONT’D)
Don’t you ever invade my personal
space again

Staircase Crazy 2 keeps stabbing Staircase Crazy 3

Jack slowly approaches him knife at the ready Jack sneaks up
behind Staircase Crazy 2 while he is stabbing Staircase
Crazy 3

Jack throws his arm holding the knife around the neck of
Staircase Crazy 2 and cuts slicing open his neck

Blood oozes out Jack backs up Staircase Crazy 2 grabs his
throat trying to stop the bleeding but is unsuccessful He
spins around and reaches out with a bloody hand towards Jack
before collapsing face first onto the ground dead

Jack grabs the knife of Staircase Crazy 2 and puts it in his
pocket

hiding behind a little earlier

Jacks eyes survey the room He notices the 13’s painted in
blood all over the walls

JACK

Quentin turns to look at them and stares at them for a few
seconds He then turns back to look at Jack

Quentin in his face when Quentin digs one of his fingers into
Jacks wound Jack screams

JACK (CONTD)

QUENTIN

Quentin starts laughing hysterically Jack swats Quentin’s
hand away from his wound

A flash of red goes on the screen

Jack is seeing red He starts punching Quentin in the face
repeatedly Hand over hand Each punch with more force then
the last one His knuckles are starting to bleed He
continues punching

Blood splashes up into his face

Jack has completely smashed Quentin’s face in but he keeps
punching Quentin’s lifeless face

Candace gets up and puts her and on Jack’s shoulder

CANDACE
He’s dead Jack

Jack whirls around to look at Candace He is covered in blood
and panting like a crazy animal He calms himself down and
looks back at Quentin’s dead body

There is a knock on the door

(CONTTNURFD )
51013 94

CRAZY PERSON AT DOOR (0OS)

onto the floor

JACK

knife

(CONTTNURFD )
51013 95

Jack falls over back onto the ground He is very weak and has
lost a lot of blood

Candace hears him fall and looks at him very upset

CANDACE
Oh my god

JACK

don’t have any time to spare

Candace grabs the weapons and rushes over to Jack She helps
him back up He is a lot slower and heavier this time He
groans as she pulls him up to his feet

CANDACE
Don’t worry I got you

JACK
I guess we aren’t even anymore

Candace laughs Jack tries to laugh but it hurts his stomach
and he groans instead

Jack turns around to look at the front door The crazy people
are pushing on it hard Almost wedging it open enough to get
into the house

CANDACE
Come on Jack

They walk as fast as they can out of the room

EXT JACK’S BACKYARD - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Jack walks through his back yard on Candace’s support It’s
night time now The back yard is very still and serene

JACK

just slowing you down

CANDACE
Don’t be silly
JACK

CANDACE

No one gets left behind remember

(CONTTNURFD )
51013 96

Jack and Candace push through out of the back yard and pass
through the gate

EXT JACK’S HOUSE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

The Crazy people break into Jack’s living room and all start
running inside Luckily it works out perfectly timing-wise as

Jack and Candace emerge from the backyard They hobble over
to the car undetected When they get to the car they pause
for a moment

Candace leans Jack against the car

CANDACE
Where are the keys

JACK
You’re not driving

CANDACE
If you haven’t noticed you are in
no shape to drive buddy

Jack thinks about it for a second and then reaches into his
pocket

JACK
Here

He grabs the keys from his pocket and tosses them to Candace
She unlocks the car and then comes around and opens Jack’s
door for him

CANDACE
Let me help you

JACK
It’s fine

CANDACE

JACK
Thanks

Candace helps lift Jack into the car

INT PARKING LOT CAR- NIGHT

Jack sits in the back of the car so he can lay down

(CONTTNURFD )
51013 97

Candace runs around to the drivers side of the car and gets
in

Suddenly the crazy people in the house see them at the car
and start running towards them

Candace tries to start the car but it wont start

CANDACE
Shit

JACK
Candace let’s go

CANDACE
I’m trying the car wont start

JACK
Give it another try or like a
jiggle or something

They are quickly approaching the car Candace tries again to
start up the engine but it just wont start

JACK (CONTD)
Candace they’re gaining on us

Candace turns to look at the people running towards the car
She quickly locks all the doors so they cant get in

CANDACE
It wont work

JACK

Candace tries one last time as the crazy people get close to
the car Luckily the gets the car to turn on just in the nick
of time

CANDACE
Yes It’s working

Candace starts driving
Candace starts laughing Jack coughs a little

CANDACE (CONTD)
Are you okay

JACK

(CONTTNURFD )
51013 98

They speed off as the crazy people run behind them Jack
turns to look at them as the get left in the distance

Jack’s eyes move from the crazy people to his house and he is
filled with the memories of the life he left behind

CANDACE
Who knows Maybe tomorrow no one
will be affected anymore

Jack thinks the idea over in his head and then slowly
responds

JACK
What do you mean

CANDACE
Well tomorrow wont be 131313
anymore It’ll be 131413 Maybe
it was all just for one day

JACK
God I hope not

CANDACE
Why would you hope that it wasn’t
just for one day

JACK
Because then I would have just
killed my wife my best friend and
countless other people for no
reason if a day later they were all
going to be okay

Candace thinks about Jack’s response and nods

CANDACE
But it was self defence

JACK
More like being impatient We could
have just waited

CANDACE
So you want it to be like this
forever

JACK

You said it yourself the Mayan
calendar the end of the world
were all bound to die some day
Some sooner then others

(CONTTNURFD )
51513 99

Candace nods

CANDACE
Well where to

Jack thinks for a minute

CANDACE (CONTD)
Well

JACK
Absolutely anywhere but here

Candace laughs

CANDACE
You wanna try the next town over

JACK
Sure Maybe it’s unaffected

CANDACE
True

Jacks smiles a half smile and stares out the window of the
car Jack is breathing hard He begins doing something with
the window

JACK
I guess

CANDACE
Who knows Maybe they at least have
some leap year babies over there

Jack laughs

JACK
Maybe

Candace notices Jack drawing something on the window

CANDACE
Were gonna be okay now Jack

Jack stops moving

CANDACE (CONTD)
We made it

There is no response

(CONTTNURFD )
51513 100

CANDACE (CONTD)
Jack what were you doing back
there

Candace turns around to look into the back seat of the car
Jack looks like he is sleeping in the back seat

Candace surveys him He looks pail and is clutching the wound
on his stomach He has lost a lot of blood

CANDACE (CONTD)
Jack

There is still no answer

CANDACE (CONTD)
Jack wake up

Jack does not respond Candace reaches over to shake Jack
She shakes his body a little

CANDACE (CONTD)
Jack

There is still no response She reaches over to check his
vitals She holds for a couple seconds A look of pure
anguish strikes her face She can’t get a pulse She begins
to cry

CANDACE (CONTD)
I’m so sorry Jack

Her eyes trace Jack from his wound up to his face Behind his
head are some smudges on the window She looks at them It’s
a stick figure family drawn in blood of a man and a little
girl

CANDACE (CONTD)
Oh Jack

Candace begins to scream in agony and has a complete meltdown

in the car After a few moments she manages to pull herself
together

CUT TO BLACK
