INT HOME FOR GIRLS — CORRIDOR - DAY

“John emerges from the MEN’S ROOM ‘The walls of the hallway are
lined with children’s artwork He glances at it as he wal ks

by

Suddenly he stops short Amidst the crude watercolors and

macaroni mosaics are several beautiful paintings surprisingly
sophisticated more like the works of Henri ‘Rousseau han the
crayon—and-stickfigure scribbles surrounding them

Then he hears something

a LITTLE GIRL’S VOICE softly HUMMING a

tune We know the words When I was jaouust a liiittle giiirl I
asked my mother What will I be

INT HOME FOR GIRLS - ART ROOM DAY
John follows the HUMMING to-a stark white room Light giants in

from a big window shining on A LITTLE GIRL in a lacy white dress

Her back is to us so we can’t see her face just curls of
platinum blonde hair spilling to her shoulders She sits at an
easel all alone painting another extraordinary picture

John watches curious

Suddenly she senses’ his presence She

stops humming the paintbrush freezes mid-stroke She turns —

She looks about eight years old with Rale skin and‘bright doe-

like eyes her del

cate features frame

by Shirley Temple curls

It’s the face of a porcelain angel a perfect little living doll

friendly and inviting

She wears a thick black velvet ribbon

around her neck and one around each wrist Her name is ESTHER

Bi there

Thank-you My name is Esther What‘s
yours uo

JOERN ae

She smiles and demurely offers her hand giggling as he takés it
She blushes then turns back to her painting Its a half-
finished jungle scene with a SMILING LION crouched beneath a tree

So what’s this one going to be -

ESTHER
My paintings axe stories that come from
my Tnagination This one’s about a sad
mother lion’ who can’t find her cubs

JOHN
She’s smiling

ESTHER - 7
She’s dreaming about her babies It’s
the only thing that makes her happy

JOHN
Well I hope she finds then

ESTHER
She will Look

“As she speaks Esther dabs her brush and paints little lion cubs
curled up in front of their sleeping mother

ESTHER
They were lost in the jungle and they
were So scared because they didn’t have
a mother or father But just when they -
thought they’d be alone forever the
found their mother sleeping under this
tree And they felt so safe that they
fell asleep too Now when the mother
lion ‘wakes up her dream will have come
true She has her family again

cried herself out John stands by the open sliding glass door

’ JOHN
The birth family is claiming her body
Theyre planning a private service

He looks to Kate for a reaction but she has none He continues

JOHN
Sister Abigail thinks she might have
been ‘playing something called “The
Choking Game” It’s a kind of
schoolyard dare You try to get a rush
by having someone choke xo until you
almost pass ont There have been cases
where kids have tried it alone and
accidentally hanged themselves

KATE
So that’s it She just vanishes from

KATE
Ive been in grief counseling for

Shes not angry just matter-of-fact He wants to say something

Let’s see what Sister Abigail thinks

INT HOME FOR GIRLS SISTER ABIGAIL’S OFFICE - DAY

Sister Abigail hands Kate and John a folder with a Polaroid of
Esther stapled to it Her case file
-19

SISTER ABIGAIL
For the mostpart she’s ‘anideal
child She’s originally from Russia
but her English is flawless Smart as
awhip and very matyrefor her age I
don‘t think I’ve ever had ‘to tell her

anything twice and I’ve never had to

cleanup after her Shes a bit of a
neat-freak

“ JOBN
I think we can handle that

SISTER ABIGAIL
Shes also fiercely independent

’ Whatever the other-children want to do

she wants to do the opposite
JonN
She told me they make fun of her
SISTBR ABIGAIL

Im suré they do but she doesn’t make-

things any easier on herself She just
doesn’t seem interested in friends

She doesn’t even play like a normal
child She just reads and paints

Most of the time she barely speaks

KATE —
Why do you think that is

SISTER ABIGAIL
Well like most of the girls here

there’s been no shortage of hardship in
her life She’s béen orphaned twice --

her birthmother died of AIDS then the

American family who adopted her was-
killed in a house fire And I strongly
suspect that she’s been sexually abused
as well

By who

SISTER ABIGAIL
I don’t know There’s nothing in her

‘history but that doesn’t necessarily

mean anything Russian adoption -
records are notoriously unreliable

JOHN ‘
Then what are you basing this on

Sister Abigail hesitates Deciding how mich to say

20

SISTER ABIGAIL
“I wish I knew There’s just something
missing with her A spark you see ina

‘ childs eyes that isn’t there I’ve
only seen that before in cdses where
the child had been severely
traumatized It might also’ expiain
some of her idiosyncratic behaviors

Like what

SISTER ABIGAIL
She refuses to shower or change clothes -
with the other girls She wont even
allow the housemother in- the bathxoom
with her She’s also very concerned
with her physical appearance for her
age She’s like a teenager getting
ready for a date every morning She
insists on wearing dresses every day
The ribbons around her wrists and neck
stay on day and night The only
trouble we ever had with her was when
we tried to take them off She kicked
two of Sister Francis’ teeth out

Kate and Jobn are taken aback - Abigail sighs

SISTER ABIGAII
Im sorry I’m not trying to
discourage you If you’re serious
I‘1ll do everything I can to expedite
the process given the circumstances
(beat)
My one reservation is this When an
adoption fails it’s usually because
the parents didn’t know what to expect
‘And’ in this case I can’t tell you what
to expect because the plain fact of the
matter is that I don’t know

INP HOME FOR GIRLS - CHAPEL DAY
Esther is happily helping a NUN clean the sanctuary Kate and
Jobn sit in a pew near the back of the empty chapel

KATE
She really did open up with us didn’t
she

JOHN
She latched right onto you - We’re
probably the best chance she has at a
normal life

Esther looks up from her work and waves at them They wave back

A normal life” That sounds really
good doesn’t it

She smiles and takes John’s hand-

not suing us

Fine but I don’t believe for a second

KATE
That’s because she’s always on her best
behavior with you

What you think is her worst is what
shes like with me all the time She’s
completely different with me than she
is with you

So youve seen her haul off and bite
someone like an animal

No but she threw that fit at school --

Yeah because the other kids were

harassing her It’s the same thing

But I wasn’t completely straightforward

I’ve worked with them my entire life
And the thing about love is that it
comet ines Siouds your judgement
at
But the truth is that I knew there was
something wrong with Esther from the
moment I laid eyes on her

Kate sits up concerned John bristles

KATE
You said you suspected some kind of
abuse

Yes but there was something else It
was hard to say what it was at first

profoundly damaged little girl

have been a mistake

Children like Esther whove 8 ent
their entire lives-in institutions

‘ have never hada chance to ‘form normal

lasting ponds The long-term effects
of ‘this can be devastating - In the

“very worst cases children who fail to

form early attachments are unable to
learn the difference between ‘right and

So the bottom line here is that you

the circumstantial evidence is enough

“DR BROWNING
I was able to coax her into admitting
that there’s been some tension between

is that you’re bloc g her attempts to

something bai happens you blame her
whether it’s really her fault or not
KATE ue
But that’s not what’s been happening -

DR BROWNING
I doubt you’re even aware that you’re
doing it But subconsciously you wan
her to be bad because ‘demonizing her is
your way of covering your own feelings
of inadequacy as a mother

KATE
I don’t feel inadequate

DR BROWNING
But you do have doubts You worry that’
you could relapse

What does that have to do with Esther

Frankly everything Your guilt over
what happened with Max is preventing

constantly fighting against it until
the collar and cuffs began cutting into
‘her skin She wound up with deep scars
from it Around her wrists and neck

DR VARAVA
Veera is gerously insane She was
molested by her father and sexualized

another lover he told Veera it was -
because she could never be a real
woman Veera murdered them both

just stares at herself in the mirror

With her scars revealed

her face scratched her mascara streaked down ‘to her chin and her
awful yellow snaggletoothed sneer she looks like a monster

DR VARAVA

She now sees herself as trapped in the
body of a child and it disgusts her
She wants to be what her father
considered to be a “real woman” She
wants to be a wife a mother a lover

She wants to grow up

Suddenly-she grabs her chaix and SMASHES the mixror with it
Then she whirls and swings the chair into her aquarium with a

‘feral scream CRASH Water and fish
