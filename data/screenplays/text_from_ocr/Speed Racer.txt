INT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY - PAST

A battered sneaker tattooed with doodles of speeding cars
and checkered flags and the words Start Your Engines
Beats up and down a sewing machine needle of anxious
restless adolescent energy

A pencil fills in the oval of a standardized test form
then hesitates twitching with the speed of a humming
bird wing caught between two fingers then is quickly
erased as a different answer is chosen

The form sheet is filled with smudges of uncertainty

A ten year old boy stares at the next question

TEST QUESTION

Grace buys a bag of 240
jellybeans There are 35 yellow
ones 52 red ones 63 green ones
26 white ones 41 blue ones and 40
black ones If Grace wants to eat
one of each while keeping her eyes
closed what is the minimum number
she will have to eat

His mouth tries to makes sense of the question but its
not working

He looks around at the other students quietly diligently
filling in their ovals while he fidgets his leg beating
his pencil fluttering a pot jiggling its lid about to
boil over

He reads the question again Greek Chinese Meaningless
He looks up at the clock The second hand sweeps towards
the 12 Then back at the test

Something suddenly clicks

He stares at the clock pencil poised waiting until the
second hand hits the 12 and hes off-

Filling in the ovals faster than it seems he could
possibly be reading the questions

INT TEACHERS OFFICE - DAY - PAST
Mrs Racer sits across the desk from Speeds teacher
MOM

DISTRACTED

TEACHER

No thats not exactly right Your
son seems to be interested in only
one thing

Mom knows whats coming

TEACHER (CONTD)

All he talks about all he seems
capable of thinking about is
automobile racing

MOM
Well you know his father designs
racing cars

TEACHER
And where is your husband
MOM
Hes-working He couldnt make
it

TEACHER

Perhaps the apple hasnt fallen

very far from the tree

Mom is uncomfortable with that truth while the Teacher
glances back to her records

TEACHER (CONTD)
Is your husbands name Rex

MOM
No Rex is his older brother Why

TEACHER

This is the test he turned in last

week

She holds up the Scantron test that Speed was working on
The bottom half of the ovals are filled in to spell out

GO REX GO
INT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY - PAST

Speed has finished filling in the test and is now drawing
pictures in the corner of the test booklet

He is drawing little race cars He flips a few of the
pages and we see a quick moment of his animation as two
cars collide

He continues to draw as the background of the classroom
fades to white behind him becoming the black corner that
he is drawing on

We watch the race going on in his head as hand-drawn cars
battle each other heading for a photo-finish Speed

makes the car noise himself including the jumping sound
as two cars try to block the Mach 5 smashing into one
another as --

The Mach 5 jumps over and through the fiery crash
crossing the finish line still in the air

Speed is lost in slow-motion revelry making the sound of
the roaring crowd

The teacher hears him and looks up frowning as she sees
him lost in his fantasy world

A little girl with a pink barrette also hears him turning
to watch him a smile creeping across her face there is
no one in the entire school like him

The teacher is about to say something when the bell
rings
Speed snaps out of his fantasy and leaps up in motion
before anyone else

TEACHER
Alright pencils down bring your

TESTS--
Thwack Speed slaps his down and is already heading for
the door

TEACHER (CONTD)
--to my desk
Ham The door slams open and Speed shoots out

TEACHER (CONTD)
Speed Racer slow down

EXT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

Speed slides down the railing on his butt a perpetual
motion machine as he scans the street smiling as he sees-
Across the street leaning against his hot rod his big
brother Rex Racer

He pauses crossing the street letting two impossibly cool
cars pass by

Here we begin to see the unique and individualized nature
of the automobile in the world of Speed Racer In this
world the grocery store parking lot looks like a car
collector show vintage and concept cars are as
ubiquitous as the Camry is in our world
Speed dashes across the street a tight parabolic arc
around the car his little head sticking up like a shark
fin circling until--

The car door pops open and snaps shut

The seat-belt clicks into place before Rex even has a
chance to move He leans over and looks in the window
Speed smiles

REX
-I take it youre ready to go
Speed nods Rex climbs in beside him

REX (CONTD)
So who was school

YOUNG SPEED

Fine Are you going to the track
Mom said you were You dont have
to drop me off I could just go
with you

REX
No way
He starts the car and roadster growls to life

YOUNG SPEED
Oh come on take me with you
Come on please

REX
I cant Speed Pops would kill
me

YOUNG SPEED

He doesnt have to know I wont

say anything Nobody will know

Come on please Rex pleaseplease
pleasepleasepleeeease

Rex sighs knowing theres no way he can with this

REX

Are you wearing the socks

Lickety-split Speed sticks his sneaker up against the
dash board and pulls back his pant leg revealing--

A bright red sock

REX (CONTD)

You roll us again and thisll be

the last time Deal

A ten year olds grin spreads ear to ear

YOUNG SPEED
Deal

INT THUNDERHEAD LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT - PRESENT

A lone figure sits on a bench away from us his racing
suit is unzipped to the waist and he sits with his head
down as though he was praying

He is wearing a pair of bright red socks

After a moment he pulls his boots on zips up his suit
and stands looking into the locker

Propped against this gloves is a photo of Rex

This is Speed ten years later He takes the photo and
slides it into one of the zippered pockets of his suit
He grabs his gloves and slams the locker shut

EXT THUNDERHEAD RACEWAY - NIGHT - PAST
The first gen T-180 screams along the metal raceway
INT CAR

Speed sits in Rexs lap wearing a too-big helmet
giggling with a childs mad glee as he steers

EXT THUNDERHEAD RACEWAY - NIGHT

The carbanks up a wall and roars down swooping past

INT CAR
Speed screeches as though riding a roller coaster

REX

Feel that shimmy Thats your hind
legs trying to outrun youre
front

SPEED
What do I do

REX

Stop steering and start driving

Speed gets serious his lips tightening the way a hand
knots into a fist

REX (CONTD)

This aint no dead piece a metal
A cars a living breathing thing
Shes alive You can feel her
talking to you telling you what
she wants what she needs You
just gotta listen

Speed tries to listen

REX (CONTD)
Close your eyes and listen
Speed does

REX (CONTD)

They say that Ben burns drove the
last lap of the 68 Vanderbilt Cup
with his eye closed

SPEED
No way

REX

No Well maybe you cant hear it
then Maybe you ought to start
hitting those books--

SPEED
No I hear it

REX
That so Okay Mr Burns you tell
me when to gas it for the jump

Speed concentrates

REX (CONTD)
Now

SPEED
Uh-uh

The jump glides towards them as the tires seem to whisper
to Speed

SPEED (CONTD)

Now

Rex smiles hitting the gas launching the car into the
air where it seems to hang fora moment before rushing
down at us as we cut--

EXT THUNDERHEAD RACEWAY - NIGHT - PRESENT

The modern T-180s come flying overhead slamming down
against the metal track scattering bright bursts of
shooting sparks in their wake

INT MEDIA ROW

A long stretch of identical glass cubicles that look down
at the raceway where announcers from all over the globe
provide color commentary for race fans

Thunderhead is a relatively small track and the media-row
should reflect that while its big enough to be covered
in several different languages it is not nearly as
important as the majors

LOCAL ANNOUNCER

--local fan favorite Speed racer
is just gobbling up this track
slipping car after car--

HAROLD LEDERMAN ANNOUNCER
--no one seems able to lay a glove
on this kid--

AUSTRALIAN ANNOUNCER

--clearly a rising star with
several big wins since turning
pro though he remains without a
major sponsor--

CHINESE ANNOUNCER

--a win tonight could put him
within range of qualifying for the
Grand Prix--

FRENCH ANNOUNCER

--let us hope he does not make the
same mistakes that his older
brother made--

INT CAR

Inside the cockpit of a racing car that feels more like a
fighter jet Speed does the thing he was born to do
Though the vibrations are enough to rattle molars loose
there is a calmness a preternatural ease in Speeds
manner that suggests this maelstrom of velocity is where
he belongs

He hears a voice in his headset

SPARKY

Heads upSpeed Seven oclock I

got Snake draftingPitter-pat

Speed looks into his mirror and sees a car with orange
and black markings stacked up tight behind another car

SPEED
I got him

EXT TECH PIT

It is smaller than a typical crew pit since the cars
dont really pit There is a panel like a sound mixing
board filled with needled gauges and green-barred light
meters

Sparky is watching through binoculars

SPARKY
I figure hell slingshot after you
in the next turn

SPEED
Im ready

EXT THUNDERHEAD RACEWAY - NIGHT

The cars explode into the next turn when Snake uses the
draft to slingshot by the car ahead of him--

Hurling like a bullet straight at Speed as--

Speed thumbs a button on his steering wheel causing jacks
to shoot out of the bottom of the car and sending it up
into the air just as--

Snake flies under it careening into the bottom of the
turn too tightly bouncing of the rail out of control
ricochetting back at Speed as--

He turns his wheels catching a part of Snakes car with
the grace of a bull-fighter sending it spinning away
towards the other cars while--

Speed rockets free--

Eliciting a huge roar from the crowd

EXT TECH PIT
Sparky smiles

SPARKY

Great move Speed Careful on the
butterfly coming up You may wanna
ease up-â€”

SPEED
Not this time Sparky

EXT THUNDERHEAD RACEWAY - NIGHT

Speed careens through a butterfly turn like there was a
slot-guide in the track causing another crowd roar
They can feel that something special might be happening

EXT TECH PIT
Sparky checks his stop watch

SPARKY
Holy canoli Speed You know who
youre racing

He can see him

SPEED

Yeah

Just ahead the ghost of his brothers car launches up
the second jump and when ti comes down we are back in the
past

EXT THUNDERHEAD RACEWAY - NIGHT - PAST

Rex drives the older model T-180 a man on a mission
dominating the race exactly like Speed

EXT GRANDSTANDS

Pops stands watching the race through binoculars Young
Spped is beside him

YOUNG SPEED

Rexs gonna win aint he Pops

Pops checks his watch but almost cant believe it He
goes back to his binoculars

YOUNG SPEED (CONTD)

Hes gonna win it Hes gonna set
the course record Nobodys gonna
catch him

POPS
Quiet Speed Theres a lotta race
to run

YOUNG SPPED
No way Its over My brothers
the best racer in the world

Everybody else is running for

second

The cars rocket through the twisted mobius of steel

EXT CREW PIT

Blackjack Benelli grabs one of the crew chief knotting
his fists in the fabric of the path-covered cover alts

BLACKJACK BENELLI
I told you to take him out

CREW CHIEF 1
Were trying sir Hes just too
fast

EXT THUNDERHEAD RACEWAY

Rex blazes by the track rattling like a metal roller-
coaster opening an even bigger lead

As we move around Rexs car we see suddenly there is
someone right behind him a ghost car--

Speed

As Speed makes his move he pulls us back into the
present

INT MEDIA ROW - PRESENT
The buzz is palpable

LOCAL ANNOUNCER

--its unbelievable folks no
ones seen moves like this since
that remarkable night eight years

AGO--

HAROLD LEDERMAN ANNOUNCER
--theres no doubt in my mind
hes gunning for it--

AUSTRALIAN ANNOUNCER

man haunted by his past---

CHINESE ANNOUNCER
--a record that has stood for
eight years set byhisolder--

FRENCH ANNOUNCER

--he is not alone out there he is

ghost of Rex Racer--

EXT GRANDSTANDS

in the glass of Pops binos we can see the dim reflection
of the two brothers racing

Pops stands beside Mom He is still watching the race

with his trusty binos though he is now a little older
plumper and balder

He clicks his stopwatch checking it at the same time

that Sprittle checks his Sprittle stands on the chair
next to him

SPRITTLE

Jeepers he could do it Pops He
could really do it couldnt he
Pops goes back to his binos

SPRITTLE (CONTD)
What if he does What if he does
it Pops

POPS
Sssh

SPRITTLE
I dont know if I can watch
this

He holds the binos as though afraid to look when--

A hairy hand comes in and takes them away

Chim-chim sitting on the chair next to Sprittle puts
the binos to his eyes

Speed flies through a piece of tricky track drawing
another cheer

Sprittle grabs the binos back just as the beautiful young
woman standing on the other side of Pops lowers her
Trixie chews at her lip feeling a knot twist into her
gut

EXT SUBURBAN STREET- DAY - PAST

The little girl wearing the pink barrette is walking with
a pack of girls their little mouths as sharp as razors
In the distance we hear a high-pitched motorized whine

BLONDE PACK LEADER

My Daddy told me he used to work
for the Mishida Motorwerks but he
quit

(MORE )

BLONDE PACK LEADER (CONTD)

My daddy said that was a
completely crazy thing to do He
says the whole family is crazy

TRIXIE
Speeds not crazy

BLONDE PACK LEADER

No hes just dumb Probably the
dumbest kid in class Ms
Waterstraat had me alphabetize the
IRB tests and you wouldnt believe
what that retard did--

Sock
Trixie decks her to the shock of the rest of the pack
just as the whine grows very loud and--

Speed comes rounding the bend on a little go-cart
wearing his too-big helmet making his big head seem
ridiculously enormous

Zipping past he suddenly notices the girl in the pink
barrette standing over another girl there is something
about her--
Maybe its way shes got her fists up like a boy or
maybe its the way her jaw is set ready to take on

ANYONE--
Whatever it is when their eyes suddenly meet he finds
he is unable to look away--
Staring at her as he drives off the road crashing
through a hedge and tumbling down a hill

TRIXIE

Speed

She runs to help him

He is laying sprawled out his car on its side wheels
still spinning

TRIXIE (CONTD)
Are you alright
Hes a bit groggy

SPEED
-who are you

TRIXIE
Im Trixie Im in your class

SPEED

-oh yeah

He stares at her for a minute powder-puffs of clouds
floating about her head

SPEED (CONTD)
He would you like to see my car
COLLECTION
She smiles

TRIXIE
Id love to

INT POPS GARAGE

Pops and Rex are working on the T-180 Rex is in a wife-
beater up to his elbows in axel grease

The sound of an angry bee hive fills the room as Speed
drives up through the big open door

SPEED
Hey Rex Hey Pops

RE X
Hey Speedy

POPS
Whos your friend

SPEED
Her names Trixie Shes in my
class

TRIXIE

He hands him the package and Pops smiles

POPS

someone with such good taste
around here Where is he

SPEED

He was in a hurry Driving a 68
Fendersin Sweet set of wheels

The car description rings a bell for Rex

REX

Let me see that

He grabs the box then holds it to his ear

ts ticking

He jams it into the go-cart against the pedal and slaps
it in reverse

The go--cart shoots out of the garage and down the
driveway until--

t explodes an enormous fireball ballooning up past the
tree tops

Trixies eyes flash with excitement

TRIXIE
Cool beans

EXT THUNDERHEAD RACEWAY - NIGHT - PRESENT

Feeling the storm of emotions that she knows Speed must

be feeling she takes a deep breath and raises the binos
back up

Through the magnifying lenses we see Speed flying around
the track

Speed blister through the high-banked slalom and it seems
at first that he is all alone but then we see the trace
effect as we realize that the two cars are making
perfectly identical moves until--

They bank into a straightaway splitting apart like a
shadow suddenly cut free as both cars accelerate--

Neck and neck the past a mirror of the present

YOUNG SPEED (V0)
Can I go with you Re

INT REXS ROOM - NIGHT - PAST
Young Speed watches as Rex packs his bags

REX

last time

The door slams in response

EXT THUNDERHEAD RACEWAY - NIGHT PRESENT

Speed and the ghost of his brother cross switching
positions as the memories come faster and faster
INT RACER LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - PAST
Speed sits on the floor glued to the television

different forces

of a locomotive dumping them onto the plates of Sprittle

They eat ravenously trying to secretly steal food from

News

POPS

It was a virtuoso display of
talent the likes of which has not
been seen at Thunderhead since
Racer the elder dropped jaws eight
years ago Now as we once again

the floor we have to ask will it
be different this time or will

colander for protection look around expecting something
bad to happen

The house becomes pin-prick quiet when--

The doorbell rings

INT LIVING ROOM

Pops opens the door to a face full of turbine exhaust
from the private K-Harrier jet parked on their front
lawn

On their doorstep is an extremely well dressed older man
carrying a bouquet of flowers and box of cigars

His smile is as bright and shiny as a surgeons scalpel
He says Good morning Mr And Mrs Racer but no once
can hear him over the howl of the turbines

He gestures asking permission to come in Pops lets him
by and closes the door immediately reducing the noise

WELL DRESSED MAN

Mr And Mrs Racer I hope you

will forgive this imposition

He hands her the beautiful bouquet of flowers

WELL DRESSED MAN (CONTD)

SPRITTLE

millions of dollars trying to
achieve chemistry Car designer

SPEED
Well excuse me for asking but
what do you want

REMMINGTON

To help I want to make sure you
have access to whatever resources
you need to continue doing exactly
what you are doing

POPS

I assume Mr Remmington that you
are not talking about
philanthropy

Remmington chuckles

REMMINGTON

I like when my partners have a
sense of humor And thats what
Im talking about A partnership
An alliance between your amazing
family and mine Thats exactly
what Remmington Industries is to

little bigger

Pops isnt exactly buying it

POPS
No offense Remmington but Racer
Motors runs as an independent

REMMINGTON
None taken I completely
understand I sympathize

REMMINGTON (CONTD)

Strike that-- I sympathize You
may think of R I As a huge
corporate conglomerate but I will
have you know sire that I still
remember working all night on a
Commodore 64 in the basement of my
foster parents home I build RI
From below the ground up So while
Remmington Industries may look
like a Major Sponsor to you it
remains in my heart as independent
to me as the first day I quit my
job at GloBocom to work for
myself

Theyre re stunned into silence while Remmington
presses on

REMMINGTON (CONTD)

Now Ive had this wonderful
opportunity to meet your family
All I am asking is for you to
please give me the chance to
introduce you tomine
EXT COSMOPOLIS - DAY

The K-Harrier drifts through the polygonal mountain range
where glittering minarets of steel and glass crown
towering cathedrals of commerce

Helicopters swarm like pollinating bees in summer field
The vista is filled with the icons of every conceivable
business in very conceivable language It is a landscape
that merges the pop-art sensibility of Warhol with the
urban sprawl of Blade Runner

INT K-HARRIER

Wood paneled elegance surround the family who sit in
overstuffed seats as soft and padded as clouds

They cant help but gawk out the windows as they float
through the city

MOM
Ive never flown so low through
the city

REMMINGTON
Special permit Only six of them
are granted a year

Sprittle and Chim-chim are gawking at something else the
vertical pull-out drawer lined with every kind candy in
the world

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

Take whatever you like

He looks at her for a moment like is in love then turns
back to the drawer where he and Chim-chim lunge for it
pushing each other back

POPS
Sprittle
SPRITTLE

She said we could

Pop growls at him his eyes telling them theyd better
not take more than one piece

Hang-dogged heads they each grab one piece of candy

POPS
What do you say

SPRITTLE

Thank you

She closes the drawer their eyes seen through the racks
watching paradise disappear as though a mirage

SPARKY

Hey theres the Grand Prix

Coliseum

Sprittle and Chim-chim rush to Sparkys window They can
see the entire track and even from this height it seems
enormous

Sprittle turns to Remmington

SPRITTLE

My brothers going to win the
Grand Prix one day
Remmingtons eyes glint

REMMINGTON

No doubt in my mind young man
Given the right circumstances I
have no doubt whatsoever

EXT REMMINGTON INDUSTRIES

Power gleams off every surface and line of the strata-
scape

The K-Harrier glides gracefully down to the private
landing pad

INT HANGERFOYER

An entourage of assistants wait like puppies at the door
Among them is a gorgeous woman with the kind of smile
that puts people immediately at ease

REMMINGTON

This is Gennie Shes our Talent
Manager Ask for anything her
jobs to make it come true

GENNIE

Hi Speed Welcome to Remmington

He shakes her hand while she signals to another man who
immediately begins scanning speed with an electronic
measuring device

SPEED
Whats this

REMMINGTON

To make an informed decision

youll need to understand how we

take care of our drivers

The tailor finishes quickly as an electric cart the kind
designed for a group tour pulls up

REMMINGTON (CONTD)
All abroad

SPRITTLE
Cool
They climb on and the driver pulls into the tramway

INT TRAMWAY

These well lit hallways are extra wide with lots of
colored guide lines on the floor like in a hospital

There are a lot of signs directional and advertisements
hawking the widely varied Remmington products

The red lines lead to doors emblazoned with Restricted
Access

There is a fair bit of hustle and bustle like a busy
street as golf carts seg-ways and motorized scooter zip
to and fro No one walks

REMMINGTON

Remmington Tower is the crown

jewel among the properties that I

control It functions as the

corporate headquarters for he top

twelve divisions of our parent

corp One big industries family

The turn a corner heading for a large set of doors with
the double R logo of Remmington Racecars

REMMINGTON (CONTD)

Of all the 143 companies that I
control none of them is as dear
to my heart as the T-180 division
The door opens as they enter---

INT REMMINGTON CAR MUSEUM

Cars from the golden Age through to the present surround
the pathway dangling in midair or mounted in situ-
dioramas each carefully lit with spotlights like works
of art or precious gems

REMMINGTON

Ive always felt that it is
impossible to peer into the window
of Tomorrow without a clear view
of the Past

SPRITTLE
Thats the Crystal Horse with the
Apache Super--Charger

REMINGTON

Winner of the Grand Prix in 69
70 and 73

SPRITTLE

No Wrong 72 71 was the
Vundervopper with the K-2 twin
turbine and 73 was the Kenobe
Motorstar re-built with a VC
triple chamber

Remmington considers arguing

SPEED
Dont bother Hes never wrong
They pass out of the museum

INT TRAMWAY

The hall widens allowing a special lane that leads out
onto an observation deck that over looks the main T-180
factory
The bank of windows overlooks the enormous facility It
is a state of the art assembly line that rises
vertically instead of horizontally The chassis arrives
at the bottom and is born up by a mechanical arm
rotating as each platform assembles the next piece

The far wall is nothing but glass providing a sun-
drappled vista of Cosmopolis

REMINGTON

Our vertically integrated plant is
the fastest in the world From
initial carbon bond to finished
car in 36 hours How long does it
take at Racer Motors

SPARKY
Several weeks at least
Remmington turns to Pops

REMINGTON

This kind of production facility

could be at your disposal Mr

Racer

The cart motor hums and slides back onto the tramway

INT ENERGY-CELL THEATRE

The next viewing stage is a window into the vacuumed-
sealed laboratory where they construct the engine that
powers the T-180s turbine

It looks like an operating theatre with several robotic
arms and a cluster of auto-surgeons operating inside
sealed perspec chambers

REMMINGTON

This is our operating theater
where our patented Refusion Energy
Distributor Network is installed
in the turbine drive

Sparkys eye light up

SPARKY
Is that an inner-positive
transponder

REMMINGTON
It is indeed
Sparky shoots a look at Pops

REMMINGTON (CONTD)

We control the only transponder

foundry in the world outside of

Mushi Motors in Taiobi

The window suddenly turns into a mirror

REMMINGTON (CONTD)
Oops Sorry Trade Secrets

INT TRAMWAY

The cart arrives at an elevator station and the driver
presses a signal control the doors opening immediately

INT ELEVATOR

The driver punches in a floor and door direction code
(north south east west) and the elevator begins to
rise while the dais in the floor begins to spin aligning
them with a different door

REMMINGTON

Now Ill take you up to the Team

Remmington training facility

The west door opens and the cart glides out into a new
tramway which is not as industrial feeling as the first
one decorated with a vinyl wainscotting and slightly up-
graded lights

The higher you go in the Remmington Tower the nicer the
halls are decorated

INT TRAINING AQUARIUM

The cart glides by a series of windows that reveal the
rigorous training systems invented to test the drivers
The first is a multi-level state-of-the-art fitness
facility in which the far wall again looks out into
Cosmopolis Beyond the standard health club fare there
is a Martial Arts gymnastics group in a standing pyramid
There is also a range of strange devices ranging from the
retro steamer boxes medicine balls and vibrating belts
to the hyper-modern triple axis gyro harness

REMMINGTON

As you know a T-180 drivers got

to be in peak physical condition

Across from the gym is a smaller window where the typical
anaerobic test is being conducted on a female driver She
is running on a treadmill with lost of wires hooked up to
her while several doctors not their approval at the read-
outs

REMMINGTON (CONTD)

No expense is spared to make sure

that when our drivers suit up

they are as perfectly tuned as the

machines they are controlling

The next window is a massive centrifuge a huge
mechanical arm whipping around a small capsule that
blasts past the window

REMMINGTON (CONTD)

The best driver must be able to
withstand over 4-Gs of force ina
typical race

On the opposite wall is the vibration chamber A man is
strapped to a chair that is vibrating so hard you expect
his eyeballs to rattle out

The next window is an underwater tank where a man is
driving in a mock up cockpit executing peddle maneuvers
and gear shifts

REMINGTON (CONTD)

The will to win is nothing without

the will to prepare and at Team

Remmington we prepare our drivers

for any eventuality and every

possible condition

The final window is the weather chamber where a driver is
again in a mock cockpit blue-lipped and shivering while
snow and wind buffet him

INT ELEVATOR

fq

The doors open and the craft glides in

REMMINGTON

with how hard we push our team I
just wanted you to see how serious
we are committed to winning

SPEED

Good But also understand that

RI Isnt all work and no play

The door opens revealing the Drivers Club

INT DRIVERS CLUB

A swanky Playboy-style casino club where stylishly
dressed male and female drivers are catered to by
beautiful male and female hostesses

Sprittles eyes almost pop out

SPRITTLE

Speed urns and sees the Captain of the Remmington Team

REMMINGTON

Cannonball saunters over wearing his two goiter-sized
diamond-encrusted champion rings

REMMINGTON (CONTD)

CANONBALL

He gestures to a special wall fitted with the trophies
and medals won by team Remmington through the years

CANONBALL (CONTD)
That what sold me You want to
win in this league youre talking
to the right guy

Remmington beams

REMMINGTON

Thanks Jack

Jack nods and the cart pulls away but not before Jack
shoots a backward glance at Speed that feels like a shank
in a prison yard

INT PENTHOUSE

The doors open and Remmington leads the family into the
penthouse suite leaving the cart behind Standard jaw-
dropping view decorated in an upscale masculine
aesthetic

Sparky whistles and whispers to Speed

SPARKY
Long way from Nob Hill eh

REMMINGTON

We treat our thoroughbreds the way

they deserve to be treated

He guides them into the room gesturing or demonstrating
all of the amenities

REMMINGTON (CONTD)

Theres full maid service of

course with a personal chef and a

masseuse available 247

The staff arrives wheeling in several racks of clothes
daywear sportswear racing uniforms and stylish evening

Gennie holds up one of the suit to Speed

GENNIE
Should be perfect Try it on

TRIXIE
Mmm hmm
SPEED

-okay

He heads to the bathroom

Taking Mom by the elbow Remmington gestures to the
sitting area over-looking Cosmopolis

REMMINGTON
So Mrs Racer what do you think
about my family Impressed

MOM
You could say that

REMMINGTON

Good I want you to understand the
possibilities that exist for your
son right now

Pops furrows his brow

REMMINGTON (CONTD)
Whats wrong Mr Racer

POPS

To be honest Remmington Im
feeling more intimidated than
impressed This kind of company
scares me People like you have
way too much money and when
someone has this kind of money
they start thinking that the rules
everyone else is playing by dont
mean squat to them

Remmington remains skillfully unfazed

POPS (CONTD)

However my sons are the most
important thing Ive ever done in
my life besides marrying my best
friend and if Speed wants us to
figure out some kind of

alliance then you can bet your

ass well be in business

Speed steps out of the bathroom His boyishness has faded
away as he suddenly seems very much a man Gennie smile
approvingly

TRIXIE
Hubba hubba
He walks over to the sitting area

MOM
Oh honey you looks so handsome

SPEED
Yeah

REMMINGTON

Very sharp Speed Suits you
perfectly Regardless of what
happens I want you to have all of
it A gift

SPEED
Thanks Mr Remmington

REMMINGTON

So how are you feeling Speed

Speed isnt sure He looks at Trixie and Sparky and then
at his parents

SPEED
Its very impressive
Remmington smiles

REMMINGTON

You think that maybe theres
something that could work out
here

Everyone waits staring at him
SPEED

I guess Id like to think about

it if I could

has really

Remmingtons a fisherman not sure if the hook
been set

REMMINGTON
This isnt the kind of offer I go
around making ever day son

SPEED

I understand that sir

He looks to Pops then takes a deep breath as though
trying to find his resolve

SPEED (CONTD)
So if I had to give an answer now
then to be honest--

REMMINGTON

Stop Right there Youre right

You should think about it Im

sure youre feeling a bit

overwhelmed You should take a

little time Think about what you

saw and heard here and well get

together early next week Deal

He reaches his hand out and Speed takes it with some
obvious relief

handsome Japanese man
When the beating is over the Japanese man slumps
forward his arms behind his back

huge man with a body like a cement-lined safe sitting
behind a desk lighting a cigar

This well-dressed fixer is Cruncher Block

how you treat your friends but

heart for that sister of yours
He begins opening a large package wrapped with butcher
paper -Inside is a bloody rack of ribs

CRUNCHER (CONTD)

Normally in a situation such as
this we would be pouring you a
nice comfy pair of cement shoes
but
He stands and goes to the large glowing fish tank that is
behind the desk

CRUNCHER (CONTD)

I think I got another solution

He dips the bloody meat into the tank filled with
piranha The water foams as the carnivorous fish shred
flesh from bone

semi-truck which is cruising down an empty rural highway

The car pulls up even with the cab and the driver feels
his gut clench as he recognizes the infamous car of Racer

chair Filling their fists with guns sliding open murder
holes slots at a variety of heights Cruncher barks into

The driver screws his jaw tight and throws the wheel to
smash into the smaller car--

But the little black tinted bug flits away with
effortless ease dancing out in front of the truck

Cruncher flips over the top of his desk revealing the
controls for a mini-machine gun located on the bottom of
the truck

He grabs the controls which are linked to an infrared
sighting camera

The driver watches the red tail-lights glowing like demon
eyes

Cruncher hits another button and he front grill of the
truck opens dropping the lower half like the double-
hinged jaw of a snake

An Apache helicopter-style rocket launcher thrusts out of
the darkness

Cruncher sights the car

CRUNCHER

Gotcha

He fires a mini-rocket straight at the manta-finned car--
But with a quick feint left the rocket skims by
exploding further down the highway

Something flashes on the back car as hidden tubes iris
open and the barrels of several weapons extend out

TRUCK DRIVER

Here he comes

Cruncher fires again the red rocket just missing
rending open the tree line with a fireball

The little car drops back alongside the truck and fires
bullets bursting tires and puncturing through the walls
of the truck The truck lurches as the thugs fire wildly
at the black car

Cruncher tries to site the machine gun but just as he
opens fire--

The black car slows drawing the chasing gun fire until
Cruncher shoots his own tires

CRUNCHER
Aww I thought you fixed that

The black car fires again bullets ricocheting inside
puncturing a hole in the fish tank

He runs to the fish tank and tries to stop the water
pouring out of the hole He sticks his finger in and the
fish immediately attack

He shrieks withdrawing his finger

The new GRX has a super charged
inner-positive transporter and
will be capable of speeds in
excess off 800 kilometers an hour
Mushi nods

MUSHI

If such a car were to win the
Grand Prix this year one would
expect the demand for transponders
to increase dramatically

REMMINGTON
One would expect

MUSHI

And if a single company gained
control of all the transponder
foundries in the world one might
expect that company to do very
well for itself

that for the last few years you

have been trying to buy out your

question is can we make a deal

painful that was It

illed all of us

ly Pops He didnt set

his shop for over a year
emory comes to life we see the

images in flashback

SPEED (CONTD)

But one night when I was still

pretty young I couldnt sleep and

I went into the living room and

there was Pops in his beat up

robe watching some old race

recordings

The blue tv light of Speeds memory fills his eyes

SPEED (CONTD)

So I sat with him watching of Ben
Burns coming round the last turn
of he 43 Prix and all of a sudden
Pops started screaming and then I
started screaming and as Burns
and Dugazi duked it out heading
for the finish we were cheering
our heads off and the second the
black and white came down we
looked at each other and right
there we realized the naked truth
racing is in our blood

Flashback ends

SPEED (CONTD)

But for Pops it isnt just a

sport Its way more important

than that Its like a religion

and in our house the Major

Sponsors are kinda like the devil

The coldness in Remmingtons eyes belies his smile

SPEED (CONTD)

I dont mean to offend you sir and
I do appreciate your offer its
just I guess I understand his
-point of view and after all weve
been through I dont think this
kind of deal is for me

Remmington chuckles

REMMINGTON
You poor naive chump
He chuckles again

REMMINGTON (CONTD)

Im going to pretend I didnt hear
that load of sickening schmaltz
and I am going to give you a bit
of an education At the end of it
if youre smart youll thank me
and hen youll sign that contract

INT TRAMWAY

Sprittle and Chim-chim are joy riding in the maintenance
cart weaving back an forth wiping people out
Chim-chim screams with glee

INT REMMINGTONS OFFICE

They stand before an enlarged black and white photograph
of five tycoons smoking cigars dressed in turn of the

century tycoon finery their well-fed faces bright with

fatuous self-satisfied smiles

REMMINGTON

Look There is the true spirit of

the golden age of racing Benjamin

Braddack Diamond Dave Tweksbury

Reginald White Oliver Potter and

George Wheeler The five most

powerful men in the world at the

turn of the last century

As he talks we flash back to jittery old footage and
photographs of the golden era

REMMINGTON (CONTD)

For all intensive purposes they

created the modern automotive

industry But the true stroke of

their genius was the invention of

the WRL the worlds first racing

league

Remmington leads Speed past several personal mementos
including the first motor of his first car the first
milk bottle from victory lanea black and white from an
important race

In front of an enlarged picture of Ben Burns from the
infamous 43 Prix is a twisted and scorched piece of
metal set on a pedestal like a gorgeous piece of art

REMMINGTON (CONTD)

Interesting that you and your
father were so moved by the 43
Prix One of the great finishes in
the history of racing right
Everyone remembers Burns and
Dugazi slugging it out but who
remembers Carl Potts Driving a
rebuilt Wittigan for Iodyne
Industries Potts spun out in the
second lap and went down as a DNF
A forgettable and pathetic finish
So bad that afterwards Iodyne
stock dropped six points

Again we see the history told in flashback

REMMINGTON (CONTD)

Meanwhile Ben Burns sat guzzling
cold fresh milk in victory lane a
thousand cameras taking his
picture Sirrus Aeronautics saw
almost a twelve point gain which
immediately block Penninsula Power
Cell from being able to afford the
price of a complete take-over
This put Joel Goldman the CEO of
Iodyne Inc in the exact position
he wanted to be in By first
buying controlling interest in his
own company at a devalued price
he then brokered a merger with
Sirrus that immediately sent
Iodyne into the gains record book--
the only record book that matters
Look out that window there isnt
a single plane or helicopter or K-
Harrier that isnt powered by

Iodyne fuel cells Thats what
racing is about It has nothing to

do with cars or drivers All that
matters is power and the
unassailable might of money

His greed is as tangible as any drug

INT TRAMWAY

A security guard glides out of one of the red secured
area doors on a segway

His radio buzzes perps last seen tramway four driving a
maintenance cart

The doors start to close when Sprittle and Chim-chim jump
out and sneak inside

INT REMMINGTONS OFFICE

Speed doesnt want to hear any more of this but
Remmington is far from done

REMMINGTON

Do you understand Burns knew he
was going to win It was already
decided A week before the Prix
Goldman and Sirrus met with
several other major players at the
Carlyle Hotel They met there as
they had for years just as their
fathers had met and as their sons
and heirs will still meet They
met to negotiate the finish order
of the Grand Prix No race is more
important and no race is more
controlled That year Goldman was
supposed to win but he knew if he
sold his win to Sirrus whatever
that win might be worth was
nothing compared to what could be
gained
He turns back to the twisted piece of crash metal

REMMINGTON (CONTD)

Thats why I paid three million
dollars for this burnt and twisted
piece of metal Because it reminds
me of what really matters This is
the true heart of racing boy This
is my religion

Speed is aghast

REMMINGTON (CONTD)

You dont know how many times I
have seen that same cow-eyed Say
it isnt so look of disbelief
Every bumpkin who comes in from
the sticks looks exactly like you
do now I wont bother proving it
to you

REMMINGTON (CONTD)

If you walk away from me if you
walk out ofthis deal youll know
how true it is soon enough So
last chance Whats it going to
be Speed Your fathers little
fantasy bubble Or are you going
to join the rest of us adults
here in reality

INT TRAMWAY

Several technician carts and trollies carrying auto parts
pass by a single lab technician who staggers drunkenly
up to a red restricted area window

Sprittle peaks out of the lower half of the lab coat
Chim-chim wearing the helmet balances on his shoulder
In the window they see a lab where they are testing a
spear---hook a secret attacking device that shoots out
from one car and grabs hold of the undercarriage of
another car
As they realize what they are looking at a security goon
comes gliding up behind them on his seg-way

By not joining Remmington

Dont be silly Youd have never
been happy driving for that
terrible man

But maybe racing isnt about being
happy Maybe Remmingtons right
and its all about business and
anyone who doesnt understand that
is just a chump

MOM

Now you listen to me young man
What you do behind the wheel of a
racecar has nothing to do with
business Before you could even
talk you were making noises that
sounded like a car engine We
used to tell people you were
speaking car-ese We used to try
to take you to the park but you
never wanted to get out of the
car

-I loved that old wagon

MOM

And do you remember the time Rex
took you out to Thunderhead and
let you drive--

Speed smiles

SPEED
And I turned it over

My heart still pounds just
thinking about it

survived was because I was wearing
red socks

have a stroke when you walked in

front teeth in your first crash

the things you do I feel like Im
watching someone paint or play
music When I go to the races I
go to watch you make art and its
beautiful and inspiring and
everything that art should be
even though there are times when I
have to close my eyes But then
there are other times when you
just take my breath away and its
at those moments when I feel your
fathers chest swell and I know
hes smiling trying to pretend he
doesnt have tears in his eyes I
just go to pieces

Why

Because I am so impossibly proud
to be your mother And even
though your father doesnt say it
he is too

Weve been after Remmington for

years for dozens of capital

fixing but we havent had the

evidence we need to convict him

Until now

Sprittle and Chim-chim peek up from behind the couch as
Mom offers the masked racer a cup of coffee

MOM
Here you are Mr X
Sprittle points at Racer X

SPRITTLE
Whats he doing here

INSPECTOR DETECTOR

Racer X works closely with our WRL
corporate crimes division helping
us recruit drivers like you
Speed Most of the media which
you are now seeing is controlled
by the Major Sponsors and they
have done their best to paint him
as a menace to the sport The
truth is hes our most valuable
weapon against these villains

SPEEED
Why does he always wear that mask

INSPECTOR DETECTOR
If any of you actually knew his
identity you would become targets

for his enemies which include some

of the most vicious Fixers in the

world

Gulp They both sink back down behind the couch

SPEED
What do you want with me

INSPECTOR DETECTOR
Youre familiar with the driver
Katsu Okamoto

SPEED
Of course

INSPECTOR DETECTOR

For years he has been contracted
by a Fixer named Cruncher Block
who we know works for Remmington
Recently Katsu has been forced to
lose races that have led to a
droop in the stock price of
Okamoto Engineering We believe
this is a part of a corporate
strategy to allow Mushi motors to
buy control of Okamoto Katsu
doesnt want this to happen and he
began resisting thinkingthat he
could do it on his own After
Fuji he realized he needed help

POPS
Why help him

INSPECTOR DETECTOR

Because he has a file with enough
information to connect Block to
Remmington which could put both of
them behind bars for the rest of
their lives The problem is he
wont give us the file unless we
help him stop the take over of his
familys company

SPEED
How

INSPECTOR DETECTOR

There is an up-coming race that
Katsu believes if he can win it
will catapult Okamoto Engineering
back into the spotlight and double
the cost of the buy out which
should kill it

SPEED

But there arent any more races
left except for the Grand Prix and
we both failed to qualify
Inspector takes a big breath

INSPECTOR DETECTOR
There arent any track races
This is a cross-country rally

SPARKY
You mean The Crucible

POPS
What

INSPECTOR DETECTOR

I know it seems cruel of me to
ask but Katsu made it clear that
he had to have Speed an X on his
team or there would be no deal

POPS
Absolutely out of the question

INSPECTOR DETECTOR
Youll have the support of the
entire C1IB--

POPS

No Rally racing is a back alley
sport full of jackals head-
hunters and thugs Im sorry
Inspector but I lost one son to
that death-trap I wont lose
another
INSPECTOR DETECTOR
I understand If you change your

MIND--

staring straight at him

it was like It felt as though he
had his hand inside my chest and
he was trying to crush everything

been in that room youd want to

believes youll turn over your

I dont believe it I dont trust
anyone who needs this kind of deal
before theyll bring a criminal to
justice

The accusation hangs in the air

down That kind of scrutiny would
only hurt the business Theyll
do as much as they can to make it
appear legit

Throwing a lever a grappler locks on to the Mach 5

Another lever is pumped like a tire pump and a sheaved
blade begins stabbing at Speeds tires

Racer X watches unable to leave Katsu unprotected
Speed hits the D button and the zircon saw blades start
gliding through the grappler

The knife slashes the tire which explodes just as the
grappler is cut--

Speed flips away free hitting the C button causing a
new tire to inflate while hes upside down--

Landing on a new tire without missing a beat

Tyrus rushes into the opening but this time its Katsue
who works a hidden lever and--

A Katana-like blade flashes a samurai slash across the
front tire--

Bowing it out flipping the entire car which tumbles
back straight at Speed forcing him to try a split-jack

Firing only the rear jump-jacks launching the back end
of the car while--

him on the side of his head

He turns just as--

SPRITTLE (CONTD)
Nice shot
Chim-chim howls as Sprittle reloads his sling-shot

POPS

CRUNCHER

Get that monkey

The goons are confused distracted and before they can
control it the fight is on--

Racer X throws the thug holding him--

Speed and Trixie dish out equal measures of chop-socky
and good of American slug-fu as--

Pops grapples and wrestles his goon into a head-lock
Racer X hammers Cruncher to the ground where he sees his
gun scrambling for it but just as he reaches for it--
Katsu steps on his hand

Its a short quick turn around and--

RACER X
Looks like another change of plan

WHILE
The security guards herd up Cruncher and the thugs
Pops turns his attention to--

POPS
Sprittlel Get over here

SPRITTLE
Ahhhh
He and Chim-chim run behind Speed

SPEED
Sprittle this isnt a game You
couldve been killed in there

SPRITTLE

Iknow it was bad I know we
shouldnt have done it But Chim-
chim was really really scared

SPEED

SPRITTLE
Okay I was a little scared too

TRIXIE
Scared of what
prittle clings to his big brother

I didnt want what happened to Rex

Racer X and Pops feel a hidden wound open

SPRITTLE (CONTD)

We just thought if you got into
trouble maybe we could help and
its a good thing we did

Speed looks at Pops as if Sprittle is making
point

POPS

Oh no youre not getting off that

heart attack already Im sure

The last of Pops line is lost to the squeal of

roar of engines as the HydroCell team flies by

They rush to their cars Speed leaping into the Mach-5
Engines growl tires spin and gravel spits as the three
cars shoot back into the race

Like eagles dropping from the sky the Okamoto ream soars
out of the mouth of the pass

stands between Snake oiler and

The Maltese Ice Caves

Trixie notices as Pops begins to bite his lip She
whispers to Sparky

TRIXIE
This is where Rex
Sparky nods

EXT MALTESE ICE CAVES

Moon-white sheaves mottled against coke-bottle colored
ice floes rise up a glistening wall of glacial plates
surrounding the thin ribbon of road

Speed enters the first series of caves bored through
earth and ice a stroboscopic oscillation of light and
dark ads and no ads as---

The memory of watching Rex disappear down the throat of
one of these caves haunts him

KATSU
Speed What are you doing

SPEED
Sorry

RACER X
Are you all right

SPEED

Im fine

Ahead the HydroCell team grows from small silhouet
flashing in and out of sight closer and closer 1
and larger until--

once more the three chase cars lock onto their rear
bumper

Well make our move in there

EXT MALTESE ICE CAVES

The open maw swallows the segmented train of cars
one slipping down into an underworld--

Where there is no purchase for advertisements-â€”
Only the cold wet darkness where white lights chas
after red ones

Speed tries to shake his fear when X calls for the
attack

RACER X

Now

The cars split apart Racer X leading the charge as--
Sparks flash as with the cross of swords metal striking
metal and--

The ice-crusted walls sparkle with star-bursts of

VIOLENCE --

The cacophony ringing through the first bending curve

t is obvious that the conditions are much more
difficult a sword fight on a frozen lake--

Each of the drivers skidding wobbling drifting farther
then they anticipated but--

he Okamoto team are just too good eliminating one and
then the other HydroCell cars until--

Speed again has Snake in his sights

his time though Snake is ready

SNAKE

Not this time punk

He throws the lever and beneath his car--

A violent spray of freezing gas immediately skim coats
the road with a fresh shimmering glaze of ice that---
Speed hits going full throttle immediately spinning
wildly out of control

He screams trying to hold on as he spits out the end of
the cave--

Smashing through the rail separating from the earth--
Hanging for a moment against the soundlessness of the
open sky--

Before dropping like a stone

RACER X

INT BLIMP

JOHNNY
Oh no

CC ANNOUNCER
Speed Racers gone over the edge

INT HELICOPTER

Everyone feels the same stomach-lurching terror as Pops
eyes go wide with the terror that he is about to lose
another son

EXT GLACIER CLIFF

Speed falls and from inside the cockpit it looks
impossibly far to the bottom but--

The wall of the cliff is not completely vertical and the
Mach-5 begins to rub against the ice

Speed reacts immediately hitting one of the control
buttons and--

Crampons shoot out of his tires giving him just enough
of a hold to try--

A split-jack jump the front jacks firing throwing the
car into a somersault across the open ravine--

Slamming against the far side which has slightly more
slope allowing the crampons to dig in as--

He drive straight up the wall of ice

TNT BLIMP

JOHNNY

He didnot He did not just do
that

CC ANNOUNCER

Speed Racer is driving straight up
a cliff face--are we getting this

JOHNNY
This kid is unbelievable
INT HELICOPTER
They all cheer

SPRITTLE
Go Speed go

EXT MOUNTAIN ROAD

Speed jumps again vaulting violently back into the
winding road just behind a disbelieving Snake

SPEED

Hi Remember me

Speed roars up after him and Snake grabs for his lever
again but now its Speed thats ready--

Jumping over the ice he body slams Snake sending him
hard into the rail as Speed shoots into the lead

SNAKE

Not again Not again

He grabs at an ankle holster yanking out a gun
INT BLIMP

Their cameras zoom in as Snake aims

JOHNNY
Oh my god hes got a gun

EXT MOUNTAIN ROAD

Speed doesnt notice until it seems his entire family
screams into his ear--

FAMILY

GUN

Snakes fires just as--

Speed hits the cockpit bubble and the bullets smack
against it like a sledgehammer into a brick wall

He swerves knowing he wont be able to take many hits as
Snake chases after him firing as--

Speed hits the crampons again and runs up the side of the
mountain then--
Flips off the wall just as the cliff face drops off
switching sides as--
Snake now finds himself on the outside as Speed bashes

him out through the guard rail

Snake tries a similar move to Speed but Snake is no Speed-
And his car bursts apart as he miss-times the flip
sending a bouncing cocoon to the distant snows below

INT BLIMP

CC ANNOUNCER
Snake oiler completely going out
of his mind--

beautifully and with less than 250
kilometers to go nothing seems to
stand between Okamoto--

capturing the moment as Katsu leads Speed and Racer X
across the finish line

almost immediately

Katsu poses with Speed and Racer X for photographers
Racer X is clearly not interested

KATSU

as a mask but it feels as though Racer X can see right
through it

INT RACER FAMILY GARAGE

Speed kicks over a tool box giving voice to his rage with
a cacophony of clattering metal

He jumps into the Mach 5 The engine guns the wheels
screech as he peels out and away leaving--

Inspector Detector standing with this hat in hand his
frown mirrored by Pops

SPARKY
I dont get it What just
happened

POPS

Okamoto played us for chumps All
he wanted was our help to drive up
the stock on his familys company
Even if there was a file he had
no intention of turning it over

SPARKY
You mean that whole race was for
nothing

INT MACH 5

Speed screams as loud as he can strangling the steering
wheel as he rockets through a series of familiar with
curves

EXT THUNDERHEAD

Without the lights or banners or crowds the race track
echoes with the same quiet portance as a cathedral It

is here that Speed has always found himself

But as he sails through neck snapping turns with reckless
abandon it becomes clear that he is chasing something
that he has lost

He seems ready to cry for all the frustration and anger
wanting so badly to undo the last few weeks of his life
Suddenly in his rearview mirror there is an answer to his
prayer a miracle--

His brother

For a moment he believes that he is again driving beside
the ghost of his brother but when the two cars kiss up
against each other Speed realizes this is no ghost--
Its Racer X
The masked Racer suddenly becomes the focus of all his
anger and Speed swings his car wielding it like a club
trying to clobber him
Racer X dodges the first blow and swings back the two have
at one another banging shoving one another into the wall--
Until Speed cant take it anymore and he goes at X as
ferociously as he can throwing him into a tailspin--
Crashing him into one of the grand stands

Silence embraces the track

Speed climbs out of the Mach 5

SPEED

X Racer X

There is a small movement in the car a shuddering as
though in pain and Speed realizes he may have gone too
far

SPEED (CONTD)
Racer X
He runs to the car but immediately stops when he realizes
the masked man is not in pan he is laughing

practically falls out of his car

RACER X

Jeezus kid You can drive I
havent been thrown like that in
years

SPEED
What are you doing here

RACER X
The inspector told me what
happened I came looking for you

SPEED
Why

RACER X
Thought youd take it hard and
maybe do something stupid

SPEED
Why would you care

RACER X
Because youre a fighter Anda
friend

SPEED

Why dont you just tell me the
truth

Racer X stares at him hard

SPEED (CONTD)
Youre Rex arent you

You mean your brother

After a long hard moment Racer X pulls off his
He is not Rex Speed is stunned

SPEED (CONTD)
Youre not Rex

RACER X

No Im sorry Speed but your
brother is dead

He pulls his mask back on

SPEED
Im sorry

RACER X

Dont be Im sure where ever
your brother is he is immensely
proud of you

SPEED
For what Making the same
mistakes he did

RACER X

For trying to make a difference
From what Ive read thats all he
tried to do

SPEED

And what good did it do He got
killed for nothing Racing hasnt
changed and it never will
RACER X

t doesnt matter if racing never
changes What matters is if we
let racing change us Everyone of
us has to find the reason to do
this You dont climb into a T-
80 to be a driver You do it
because youre driven

SPEED
dont know why Im doing it
anymore

RACER X

Thats obvious At Fuji you were
trying to prove something At
Cristo you were looking for
justice Neither are the reason
you belong behind a steering
wheel

SPEED
If you know so much why dont you
tell me why I should keep driving

RACER X

Sorry Thats for you to figure
out

He climbs back into his car

RACER X (CONTD)

I just hope when you do Im there
to see it

He roars away leaving Speed alone

INT SPEEDS ROOM

but he ignores it

Speed crosses to the door but Pops is already
sitting waiting a heaviness in hislimbs

POPS

Speed before you go Id like to
say a few things Will you sit

with your old man for a minute
Speed chafes a bit but drops his bag

SPEED
Dont try to stop me

POPS

I wont I made a mistake trying
to tell you what to do at Cortega
You were right I was wrong I
wont make that mistake again
Speed sits

POPS (CONTD)

I want you to know that I acted
rashly I said things I wish I
hadnt Your mother usually
protects me from making an ass out
of my self but I was determined to
do it this time and I guess I did
a pretty good job of it I wanted
to make sure you understood how
sorry I was

SPEED
Thanks

POPS

The truth was I couldnt have
been more proud of you son Not
because you won but because you
stood up you werent afraid and
you did what you thought was
right

SPEED
So It didnt amount to anything
It was completely meaningless

POPS

How could it be meaningless I

saw my son become a man I

watched him act with courage and
integrity and drive the pants off

of every driver on the road This

is not meaningless This is the

reason for a fathers life

Pops eyesbegin to twinkle with tears

POPS (CONTD)

I admit I went to Cortega because
I was afraid that what happened to
Rex was going to happen to you
And I just couldnt take that I
couldnt loose another one of my
boys like that again But what I
realize in Cortega was that I
didnt lose Rex when he crashed I
lost him here I lost him when he
walked out of this house and I let
him go without telling him how
proud I was of him and how much I
loved him I let him think that a
stupid motor company meant more to
me than he did Youll never know
how much I regret that mistake
but its enough that Ill never
make it again

He puts his big bear arms around him and hugs him

POPS (CONTD)

I love you Speed I understand that
every child leaves home but I want
you to know that door is always
open and you can always come back
SPEED

love you Pops Im just so
confused right now I dont what
m doing or why Im doing it Im
locked up in some kinda tailspin
and no direction makes sense

POPS

know what thats like When Rex
died I didnt even know if I
wanted salt on my eggs let alone
if I wanted to keep building cars
Then do you remember when we sat
here that night watching old Ben
Burns and Dugazi You remember
that

Speednods vaguely

POPS (CONTD)

Sittin here cheering with you
something just clicked like a
light being switched on inside of
me and after that I never had
trouble remembering how I liked me
eggs

SPEED
Jeez Pops Thats just it
Thats part of my problem

POPS
What

SPEED

That race The 43 Prix Burns

and Dugazi It was fixed
Remmington told me the whole
story It was all about some DNF
names Rotts Theyve known the
winner of every Grand Prix for the
past 50 years Its always fixed
Thats a tough pill for Pops to swallow

POPS

I dont believe that
Remmingtons a crook You cant
believe a crook

her own incandescence

HORUKO

Forgive me for intruding but I had

to come before it was too late

Speed eyes her for a moment wondering if this is another
set-up

HORUKO (CONTD)

This is not a trick I swear to
you I am not my brother

POPS

You going to ask the lovely lady
in

SPEED
Yeah sure Come on in
She steps in looking somewhat out of place in the
suburban living room

POPS
Can I get you something to drink

HORUKO

No My security man believes I am
still at the opera so I only have
a moment

She turns to Speed

HORUKO (CONTD)

I am very sorry for what happened
what my father and brother did was
not right and I am ashamed

SPEED
Its fine Just another lesson
learned

HORUKO

No It is they who are in need of

a lesson

She pulls an envelope out of her bag and gives it to
Speed

HORUKO (CONTD)
This rightfully belongs to you
He opens the envelope and his eyes immediately light up

SPEED
An invitation to compete in the
91st annual Grand Prix

HORUKO

My brother was planning to decline

anyway but I studied the rules

very carefully and as a member of

the Okamoto team if you present

this invitation on the day of the

race they must allow you to

compete

Pops bursts into a smile and slaps Speed on the back POPS
Whaddya think of that Mr Its-
Always-Fixed

HORUKO

You do not have to say anything
I only hope you drive as you did
in Casa Cristo and you wipe the

smiles from their faces

be looking at all day

Speed tries to ignore him and the other drivers staring
at him like a fox staring at a chicken

SPARKY
Howya feelin
Speed takes a breath as he dares to look around again

SPEED
-its big

SPARKY
Hey this cockpit is the exact
same size it was at Thunderhead

SPEED
Right

SPARKY

Just wanted to say thanks for
what could be the most exciting
moment of my life

SPEED

Couldnt have gotten here without
you

He hugs him

SPARKY
Im looking forward to that cold
milk

SPEED
Me too
Speed climbs in as the speaker system blares--

FEMALE ANNOUNCER VOICE
Ladies and gentlemen start your
engines
The engines erupt crashing against the waves of the
roaring crowd but--

Inside the Mach 5 everything goes completely silent
Nothing exists now for Speed except the track as he loses
all separation between himself and his car

He takes a deep breath and closes his eyes as the
countdown begins

INT GRAND PRIX ANNOUNCERS BOOTH

CASS JONES

The final countdown has begun and
a stillness has fallen over this
stadium as all eyes turn to one
car

BEN BURNS
This aint a race Its a
showdown

EXT GRAND PRIX

Again we cut to the many varied expressions of
anticipation Trixie Mushi Okamoto Sprittle and Chim-
chim Katsu and Horuko Mom and Pops Remmington and
Racer X who no longer has any socks until--

The gun sounds--

The cars become bullets hurdled forward except for the
car in front of Speed which barely moves blocking his

PATH--

He tries to avoid it but cant rear-ending him while the
car behind him slams into the back of the Mach 5

INT GRAND PRIX ANNOUNCERS BOOTH
CASS JONES

Trouble at the start a misfire
traps Speed Racer causing a
COLLISION--

BEN BURNS
Uh-oh Look out

EXT GRAND PRIX STARTING LINE

A car to the side swerves aiming straight at Speed who
manages at the last second a slip-jack jump--

Flipping over the car as it slams into the pile-up while--
Speed guns his engine in the air so that when he hits the
track there is a scream of burning rubber and the Mach 5
rockets out of the start to the cheering crowd

INT GRAND PRIX ANNOUNCERS BOOTH

CASS JONES
dont know how he got out of
that one--

BEN BURNS

That-kids wiley
EXT GRAND PRIX TRACK
The first lap of the Grand Prix is Ben Hur brutal as car
after car takes a shot at Speed but--

He uses their aggressiveness throwing them into each other--

Littering the track with flaming debris and bouncing
cocoons

INT GRAND PRIX ANNOUNCERS BOOTH
They try to keep up but Speed is even too fast for them

CASS JONES
Speed fakes left jumps right--

BEN BURNS
Nice nice--

CASS JONES
He slips in behind Gearbox---

BEN BURNS
Here comes over under--

EXT GRAND PRIX TRACK

Speed executes another beautiful maneuver sending Gearbox
crashing into Boom-Boom--

Both cars going boom-boom their rubber cocoons bouncing
free

INT GRAND PRIX ANNOUNCERS BOOTH
Ben Burns is giddy with glee

BEN BURNS
I told you I told you

CASS JONES

Speed Racer seems unstoppable
moving up from dead last nearing
the leaders as they head into the
slalom with the Gray Ghost
battling Prince Kabala and
Cannonball Taylor for the lead

EXT GRAND PRIX TRACK

The Prince tries to sight the Ghost in his mirrors but
the Gray Ghost seems to vanish

GRAY GHOST

Where am I Where am I Im

here I am over there Im

Savior Faire

The Prince tries to block the Ghost but he cant seem to
locate him

GRAY GHOST (CONTD)

Im everywhere baby

Wham The Ghost is on him pouncing slipping into what
feels like a shoulder throw that sends the Prince
spinning out of control onto the onrushing Nitro--
Shattering the Princes car like a mis-struck diamond
reduced in one hammer stroke to twinkling dust

The two more cocoons bounce onto the road as the other
cars roar past

INT GRAND PRIX ANNOUNCERS BOOTH

CASS JONES

A spectacular crash as the
Princes jewel-covered Gigerbon
worth an estimated 22 million
dollars is scattered over a
quarter mile of track

BEN BURNS

Id like to work clean up on that
crash

They chuckle

CASS JONES
But look out as they approach the
Big Drop here comes Speed Racer

EXT THE BIG DROP

The cars head over as though falling off the end of
Niagara and while other drivers cling to their steering
wheels just trying to hang on--

Speed presses the accelerator making his move--
Banking higher than anyone up the big wall and when he
dives back down there are only three cars left ahead of

HIM--
The green Mushi motors car the Gray Ghost and the Black

GRX

INT GRAND PRIX ANNOUNCERS BOOTH

CASS JONES

Speed Racer is knocking on the
door of the new GRX driven by
Cannonball Taylor
BEN BURNS
You hoot Anybody home

INT MACH 5

SPEED

Ok Mr Two Time Grand Prix Five

EXT GRAND PRIX TRACK

Speed makes a move and Cannonball blocks but it is
clumsy and Speed quickly counters--
Bouncing Cannonball into the wall

SPEED

Come on Is that it

He swerves back and the two cars begin to battle but it
is immediately clear who is the better driver as--

Speed throws Cannonball from one side of the track to the
other

TNT GRAND PRIX ANNOUNCERS BOOTH

CASS JONES
Cannonball Taylor is in trouble

BEN BURNS
Tear â€˜em up kid

INT GRAND PRIX PENTHOUSE

The knuckles of Remmingtons fist crackle as he wrings
the tension

REMMINGTON
Do it Stop him Stop him now

INT MACH 5
SPEED

Lessons over See you at the

finish line

Speed slides into Cannonball to throw him but as he does--

Cannonball throws a hidden switch and under the two cars
a spear hook shoots out and locks onto the Mach 5
undercarriage

Speed feels it and knows what happened immediately

SPEED (CONTD)
No

SPARKY
What is it

SPEED

Spear hook Hes got me

Cannonball slows driving both cars into the wall
grinding against the Mach 5 while the trailing cars shoot
post

INT GRAND PRIX ANNOUNCERS BOOTH

CASS JONES

Cannonball has Speed pinned as
they grind through the butterfly
turn

INT GRAND PRIX PENTHOUSE

Remmington relaxes as Speed falls further off the leader
pace

Sprittle understands immediately what is going on
SPRITTLE

The surrounding crowd becomes uncomfortable

POPS

nothing but a big cheater

nother neither car gaining an advantage until--

dvantage as they head for the final pylon---

INT GRAND PRIX ANNOUNCERS BOOTH

BEN BURNS
This is going to be ugly

EXT GRAND PRIX TRACK

At the last second Speed hits the two outside jacks
causing both cars to rise up onto the two outside wheels
of the GRX--

Revealing the undercarriage and the hidden spear hook to
the camera

The crowd gasps

SPRITTLE
Told you so
Chim-chim high fives him

SPRITTLE (CONTD)
Cheaters never prosper

EXT GRAND PRIX TRACK

The Mach 5 flips down pancaking the GRX while the Mach
5 crashes free leaving the exposed spear hook to hang
limply from the front of the GRX

INT GRAND PRIX ANNOUNCERS BOOTH

CASS JONES
Cannonball clearly using a spear
hook

BEN BURNS
That could cost him the Hall of
Fame

Not to mention what it might do to

Speed takes a deep breath and it seems the entire stadium
takes it with him He closes his eyes and tries to
listen to the car

Ss
What do you need

Something makes him put the car in second gear He steps
on the accelerator then hits the starter and---

And the Mach 5 roars to life

The crowd screams to the wail of burning rubber

INT GRAND PRIX ANNOUNCERS BOOTH

CASS JONES

Hes back in it but less than a
lap and a half I dont know what
kind of chance he has

BEN BURNS
Come on kid Move it
EXT GRAND PRIX TRACK

The red socks flash as Speed stomps on it jamming the
accelerator to the floor

Hes a half-lap behind the entire field but every eye in
the stadium is on the white and red streak of lightening
as it--

Thunders by rattling the elaborate lace work of concrete
and steel--

Gaining inch by inch foot by foot

INT GRAND PRIX PENTHOUSE

People abandon the televised images wanting to watch
this miracle to see it with their own eyes

INT GRAND PRIX ANNOUNCERS BOOTH

CASS JONES
Look at the split Hes shattering
the lap record

BEN BURNS
Dont mean a thing without those
checkers

EXT GRAND PRIX TRACK

Speed comes out of the spiral glimpsing the back of the
trailers as they go over the Big Drop

Where they ease over the edge Speed hurls out going
airborne free-falling past two trailers as--

The grade of the slope reaches up and gently eases the
Mach 5 back onto the track to the delight of the crowd
The Mach 5 surfs up the big bank weaving through another
pair that try to stop him with spectacularly disastrous
results

outside the Mach 5 a maelstrom of violent chaos churns

WHILE--
Inside Speed is perfectly at pease

INT GRAND PRIX ANNOUNCERS BOOTH

CASS JONES

No hesitation nothing fazes him
no one seems capable of stopping
him

BEN BURNS
This kid aint just driving--hes
on a mission

INT GRAND PRIX PENTHOUSE
Remmington cant take it losing all pretense of decorum

REMMINGTON
Stop him Stop him

EXT GRAND PRIX TRACK

Speed weaves through the butterfly cloverleaf taking
each turn at such intense speeds that the cars he passes
seem to be moving in slow motion

By the end of the slalom he is back where he left off
with two cars left ahead of him--

Mushi motors and the Gray Ghost

GRAY GHOST
Welcome back kid Been lonely up
here without you

INT GRAND PRIX ANNOUNCERS BOOTH

CASS JONES

With a quarter lap to go Speed
Racer is back two cars beneath
him and destiny
INT MACH 5

peed suddenly feels the weight of everything that has
rought him to this point

e sees images and hears voices flashing through his
ead as though at his own death

he montage finishes with the image of Speed as a ten
ear old boy drawing pictures of race cars making all
he noises lost in a dreamworld that has become reality
e sees the finish line and makes his move

he Gray Ghost sees it coming first

Hthe ATOM

GRAY GHOST

Oh yeah here we go here we go

Speed flashes one way then another moving in ghost-like
feigns here there and everywhere

GRAY GHOST (CONTD)

Whats this Whats this Hey

now Thats my move

Before Ghost knows where to go Speed ducks past--â€”

Sling-shotting down alongside the Mushi motors car The
Yukuza driver tries to block but--

Speed jumps dodging the hit causing the Mushi car to
swerve and then wildly correct--

Swinging back as Speed hop-scotches over him again just

AS--

The Ghost flies in taking a broadside hit from the Mushi
car both of them exploding just feet from the finish
line as--

Speed launches up and through the cloud of smoke and
fire crossing into history with the flashing wave of the
checkered black and white--

Fluttering softly in the silence as the crowd begins to
rise to their feet

The Mach 5 slides to a stop and for a moment Speed
catches his breath then slowly pulling off his helmet
he begins to let it all in--

The thunder of the crowd can be felt through his chest

straight to his heart
INT GRAND PRIX PENTHOUSE

Remmington screams overturning a table of caviar and
lobster crashing the elaborate ice sculpture of the GRX
at the feet of Mushi who turns and walks away in disgust

EXT GRAND PRIX GRANDSTANDS

Pops chest is out tears running down to his moustache
as he wraps his arms around Mom who goes to pieces as
Chim-chim and Sprittle leap up and down hugging Trixie

no end of secret joy

INSPECTOR DETECTOR

Can I ask you a question Do you
ever think you made a mistake
hiding the truth from them

There is a flash of images as we glimpse the truth
images of Rex watching his car explode in the ice caves
his funeral then the facial surgery then the mask of
bandages as one face is lost in a mirror and another is
revealed

RACER X
If I did then its a mistake I
have to live with
He walks away while---
EXT VICTORY LANE

Several of the other drivers led by the Gray Ghost
applaud and salute Speed as--

The Racer family is led through the swarm of
photographers and fans

TRIXIE

She pushes towards him and he sweeps her up into his arms
and kisses her surrounded by the sparkle of camera flash
