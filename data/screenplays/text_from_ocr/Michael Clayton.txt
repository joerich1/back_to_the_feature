INT KENNER BACH and LEDEENVARIOUS SHOTS -- NIGHT

It’s 200 am in a major New York law firm Ten floors

of office space in the heart of the Sixth Avenue Canyon
Seven hours from now this place will be vibrating with the
beehive energy of six hundred attorneys and their attendant
staff but for the moment it is a vast empty half-lit
shell A SERIES OF SHOTS emphasizing the size and power of
this organization shots that build quietly to the idea that
somewhere here -- somewhere in this building -- there’s
something very important going on MUSIC and CREDITS already
mixing with the crazed manic express train chatter of --

ARTHUR EDENS (VO)

-Michael Dear Michael Nurse
Michael Dr Clayton Secret Hero
Keeper of the Hidden Sins Of course
it’s you Who else could they send
Who else could be trusted Smoke on
the horizon -- hole in the bucket --
voices crying from Milwaukee to
Manhattan “Where’s our hero”
“Where’s our Cleanser Of The Hidden
Sins” And here you are sleeves
rolled up lips sealed -- broom --
dustbin -- bankroll at the ready
Fifties is it still fifties When
you came to Boston you remember
God you must’ve had a thousand of
them The cash -- the smile -- the
quiet word in the corner -- of course
it’s you Michael who else could it
ever be But Michael please before
you sweep please just hear me out --

just try -- because it’s not like
Boston -- it’s not an episode --

relapse -- fuck up -- I’m begging
you Michael make believe it’s not
just madness because it’s not just
madness --

A XEROX MACHINE -- cranking out high-speed copies -- ten
pages a second flashing before our eyes -- all information
a blur except for the letterhead which is constant

ARTHUR EDENS (V0O)
-- I mean yes -- okay yes -- elements
of madness -- the speed of madness --
yes the occasional euphoric pseudo-
hallucinatory moments that yes -- fine
-- agreed -- distracting -- nostalgic --
all of that --
(continuing as--)

A HUGE EMPTY OFFICE BULLPEN CUBICLES AND WORKSTATIONS

ARTHUR EDENS (VO)
-- but that’s just the package --
the plate -- think of it as a tax --
The Mania Tax -- The Insanity Tax --
or like advertising on TV -- it’s the
freight -- the weight -- it’s the
price of the show --

A LONG DARK CORRIDOR A CLEANING CREW IN THE DISTANCE

ARTHUR EDENS (VO)
-- just please just hear me out
Michael because I swear to you this
is so much so very much more than
the ravings of some hypo-maniacal
bipolar attorney --

PAPERWORK ONTO A TROLLEY --

ARTHUR EDENS (VO)
-- Two weeks ago I came out of the
building -- I’m running across Sixth
Avenue -- there’s a car waiting -- I
have exactly thirty-eight minutes to
get to Laguardiaand I’m dictating --
there’s this frantic associate running
to keep up --

A SENIOR PARTNER’S OFFICE A SECURITY GUARD SNEAKING A
SMOKE IN THE DARK BY AN OPEN WINDOW

ARTHUR EDENS (VO)
-- we’re in the middle of the street --
the light changes -- the traffic --
unleashed -- it’s coming -- serious
traffic -- but there I am -- I’m
babbling -- my mouth -- I can’t stop --
some ridiculous involuntary part of my
brain just keeps going -- I’m standing
there dictating this trade secret
Motion to Suppress
AN OFFICE PHONE TWELVE LINES BLINKING IN THE DARK

ARTHUR EDENS (VO)

and there Michael in the middle
of Sixth Avenue -- as I stood there
jabbering -- and this poor young woman
is screaming -- traffic speeding toward
us -- I looked at my hands and my suit
-- my briefcase -- and it came to me --
came over me -- through me -- the
overwhelming sensation -- the feeling --
the fact -- that I was covered with
some sort of film -- an oil -- an ooze
-- my hair -- my face -- like a glaze --
a coating -- and at first I thought
“My God I know what this is this is
some sort of amniotic embryonic fluid -

- I’m drenched in afterbirth -- I’ve
breached the chrysalis -- I’ve been
reborn” --

ASSOCIATE 1 WHEELING THAT DOCUMENT TROLLEY PAST AN EMPTY

ARTHUR EDENS (VO)

-- but the traffic -- this stampede --
cars -- trucks -- the horns -- the
screaming associate -- I’m thinking
“No -- reset -- this cannot be rebirth

If anything this must some giddy
illusion of renewal that happens in the
final instant before death” --

A MAINTENANCE WORKER VACUUMING A LARGE RECEPTION STAIRCASE

ARTHUR EDENS (VO)
-- and then -- in the fraction of a
Moment it took for that idea to form --
I realized all of that was wrong
because I looked back at the building
and had the most stunning moment of
clarity

THE WORD PROCESSING DEPARTMENT TWENTY PEOPLE -- ACTORS
DANCERS ARTISTS INSOMNIACS -- THE GRAVEYARD SHIFT
HAMMERING OUT OVERNIGHT LEGAL PAPERWORK

ARTHUR EDENS (VO)

I realized Michael at that moment
that I had emerged -- as I have done
nearly every day for the past twenty-
eight years of my life -- not through
doors of Kenner Bach and Ledeen --
RECEPTION LOBBY ASSOCIATE 1 WHEELING THE TROLLEY OFF
THE ELEVATOR

ARTHUR EDENS (VO)
-- not through the portals of our huge
and powerful law firm but rather from
the asshole of an organism whose sole
function is to excrete the poison --
the ammo -- the defoliant -- necessary
for even larger and more dangerous
organisms to destroy the miracle of
humanity --

ANOTHER EMPTY HALLWAY A BANQUET TABLE LITTERED WITH THE
PICKED-OVER REMNANTS OF AN ALL-NIGHT CATERED FEED

ARTHUR EDENS (V0O)
-- and that I have been coated with
this patina of shit for the better part
of my life and that the stink and stain
might in all likelihood take the rest
of my days to undo --

AND NOW -- WIDER TO FIND -- ASSOCIATE 1 WHEELING THE
TROLLEY TOWARD BIG DOORS AT THE END OF THE HALL --

ARTHUR EDEN’S (VO)
-- and do you know what I did next
I took a deep cleansing breath
I set that notion aside I tabled it
I said to myself “As clear as this may
be -- as potent as this may feel -- as
true a thing as I believe I have
witnessed here -- I must wait It must
stand the test of time”

REPORTER (PHONEOVER)
“Marty hi it’s Bridget Klein Look

MARTY
The case you’re referring to is now
as it has been for the past six years
pending and unresolved Until our
client has their day in court or the
plaintiffs come to their senses and
drop the suit I’1l have nothing of
value to tell you

BARRY kneeling there hanging on every word --

REPORTER (PHONEOVER)
“Come on Marty Barry’s telling me
you’re off at some conference I know
for a fact you’re in the office right
now with like six hundred people trying
to push this thing through”

MARTY

MR GREER

What they did you see they changed
the grade there They widened the

they were making an improvement

MICHAEL on a stool at the island MRS GREER standing by
herself Nightgown pulled tight Her second tumbler of
Scotch

MR GREER
But now you see when it rains
With this new angle and they put

these new these sodium lamps -- it’s
blinding that turn there Just
blinding

MICHAEL

They’1l have to take a look at that

MR GREER
And this it’s not just tonight
I’ve been saying this for years
(to his wife)
How many times have we talked about
that corner Gen

MRS GREER silent Numb

MICHAEL
Mr Greer we don’t have a great deal
of time to work with here

MR GREER’s anxiety sharpening Arrogance under siege

MR GREER
So the circumstances road conditions
none of this holds any interest for
you

MICHAEL
What interests me right now is finding
the strongest criminal attorney that
can get here in the next fifteen
minutes

MR GREER
(bristling)
Well that sounds ominous

MICHAEL
We have some good relationships up
here in Westchester

MR GREER
So what are you You’re not a lawyer

MICHAEL
Not the kind you need

MR GREER
What kind is that

MICHAEL
You need a trial lawyer Someone
to see this all the way through
That’s not what I do

There it is And MR GREER doesn’t like it one bit

MR GREER

I think we’re gonna need to pull Walter
back in on this

(like it’s some kind of

business meeting)
I want to get him back on the phone
get him into the mix Because I’1l
be frank I’m not sure I like the way
this is going

MICHAEL
Sir
(cut the crap)
We don’t have time for Walter
Your options here they’re gonna get
smaller very quickly

MR GREER
What options I’m not hearing any
options

MICHAEL

I’m suggesting you go local I’m
telling you there’s several people up
here I like for this

MR GREER
And that’s it That’s what you’ve got
(to his wife)
You believe this
(MORE )
I’ve

MR GREER (contd)

(incredulous)
been a client at Kenner Bach

for twelve years You think I pay

that

retainer every month for a place

at the back of the line

MICHAEL

Mr Greer you left the scene of an
accident on a slow weeknight six
miles from the State Police barracks
Believe me if there’s a line you’re
right up front

MR GREER

I can get a lawyer any time I want
You think I need you for that You
think we’re sitting here forty-five
minutes waiting for a goddam referral

MICHAEL

Look I don’t know what Walter promised

you

but whatever it w--

MR GREER

“Miracle Worker”

(cutting him cold)

That’s a direct quote That’s Walter
twenty minutes ago okay “Hang tight
I’m sending you a miracle worker”

MICHAEL

Well he misspoke

MR GREER

About what That you’re the firm’s
fixer Or that you’re any good at it

MRS GREER

-- MRS GREER just hurled her highball into

the sink Staring at her husband Silence until --

MR GREER
What if someone had stolen the car
Happens all the time
(dead air)
Hypothetically

This awful pause MICHAEL wielding the silence like a club

MICHAEL
Cops like hit and run cases They
work them hard and they clear them
fast Right now there’s a BCI unit
picking paint chips off a guardrail
Tomorrow morning they’re gonna be
looking for the owner of a custom-
color hand-rubbed green Mercedes SL
500 This guy you hit if he got a
look at the plate it won’t even take

that long
Like that -- THE PHONE RINGS -- harsh -- sudden --
MRS GREER
-omigod
MICHAEL

(ignoring the phone)
There’s no play here There’s no
angle There’s no champagne room
And I’m not a miracle worker I’ma
janitor So the math on this is
simple the smaller the mess the
easier it is for me to clean up

THE PHONE STILL RINGING and --

MR GREER
(small now)
It’s the police isn’t it

MICHAEL

No They don’t call

(calmly picking up--)
Hello

(beat)
Jerry Hey it’s Michael

(pause)
Yeah sorry I’m in the neighborhood
You got a pen

MICHAEL on hold Silence now MR AND MRS GREER parked
like glaciers Broken glass in the sink

EXT WESTCHESTER MANSION DRIVEWAY -- NIGHT

One hour later MICHAEL leaning on the MERCEDES munching
on a loaf of stale French bread Looking over as JERRY
DANTE local criminal attorney comes out of the house --

JERRY

He’s changing his shirt

(as he arrives)
I talked to my guy at the State Police
barracks Better we go over there and
surrender and they can tell the town
cops to kiss off This kid he hit
he’s a waiter at one of those clubs
along the strip there He’s stable
I guess they’re putting some pins in
his hip Good news is he got busted
selling pot last year so we got
something to work with anyway

MICHAEL
You don’t need me for this right

JERRY
Couldn’t hurt

MICHAEL
I’1l have somebody call you

JERRY nods Okay But lingering a moment because --

JERRY
So Michael look I was thinking of
you last week My cousin Frank from
Brooklyn Kings right He’s out in
Nassau now They got an opening on
the probate bench He’s kind of going

for it
MICHAEL
That’s a tough crowd
JERRY
No shit Can I have him call you
MICHAEL
Sure
JERRY

And don’t worry about this
(re Mr Greer)
I‘1l put my back into it

MICHAEL nods Heading for the car and --

EXT MANSION DRIVEWAYCOUNTRY ROAD -- NIGHT

THE MERCEDES speeding away from the house --

INT THE MERCEDES -- NIGHT

MICHAEL driving Escaping Running from more than Mr Greer
and Jerry Dante More than just a bad night boiling behind
his eyes Driving hard and wild Turning suddenly and --

EXT WESTCHESTER COUNTRY ROAD -- NIGHT

THE MERCEDES racing along

INT THE MERCEDES -- NIGHTPRE-DAWN

MICHAEL -- turning again -- aimless -- windows open --
cold air whipping through -- braking suddenly -- impulsive
-- turning -- suddenly -- faster now and --

EXT NEW COUNTRY ROAD -- PRE-DAWN

First light A smaller road THE MERCEDES speeding past
large estates tucked back in the fog and deep woods

EXT THE FIELD -- DAWN

A HUGE OPEN PASTURE Surrounded by forest The sun just
starting to rise Cold mist hanging over the whole valley
Nothing but gray and green Stark Perfect

THE MERCEDES speeding toward us -- climbing around the turn --
eating up the valley road that runs along the pasture -- but
suddenly the car is slowing -- braking hard and --

INT THE MERCEDES -- DAWN

MICHAEL pulling to a stop Staring out the window

EXT THE FIELD -- DAWN

MICHAEL getting out of the car Standing there

THREE HORSES poised at the crest of the pasture Hanging
there in the fog like ghosts

MICHAEL jumping the fence Walking slowly into the field
Behind him the MERCEDES with the engine running

THE HORSES aware of him now Watching him come
MICHAEL’S FACE as he walks And later on we’ll understand

all the forces roiling inside him but for the moment the
simplest thing to say is that this is a man who needs more

than anything to see one pure natural thing and by some
miracle has found his way to this place The wet grass and
cold air and no coat -- none of it makes any difference to
him right now -- he’s a pilgrim stumbling into the cathedral
And he stops Just standing there Empty Open Lost
Nothing but the field and the fog and the woods beyond

THE HORSES staring at him

MICHAEL staring back And just like that

THE MERCEDES EXPLODES

THE HORSES already running before MICHAEL can turn back --
pieces of the car that have been blown into the sky still
raining down before he’s fully grasped what’s happening --

MICHAEL simply shocked Senseless Standing there frozen
Stunned What just happened The car -- his car -- is gone
-- just like that MICHAEL looks around Looks back

He should be dead He is not

When THE GAS TANK EXPLODES

And suddenly it’s clear All that staggered chaos in
Michael’s eyes suddenly replaced with steel He should be
dead He is not

And now he’s walking Toward the car

Walking faster Determined And suddenly he’s running --
running toward the fire Faster and faster as we

There’s Thieves Gray Mages Unbidden
Warriors Dark Avians Riverwynders
Sappers -- there’s like fifteen kinds
of characters okay

MICHAEL
Okay

MICHAEL fighting distraction HENRY so eager and serious

HENRY
So basically you have all these
characters who don’t know each other
and they don’t know why they’re here
and nobody has any alliances okay
Whatever alliances you had before are
gone You can’t even say who you are
because you don’t know maybe the
person you’re talking to maybe they
were like your mortal enemy in the
wars So it’s just completely like
everybody for themselves

MICHAEL
Sounds familiar

HENRY
It’s really good I’m serious
You should really read it

MICHAEL
Right And by the time I finish it
you’re gonna be onto something else

HENRY
How much you want to bet

MICHAEL
I don’t know How much you got

MICHAEL glances over The boy just aching with sweetness

HENRY

HENRY getting out of the car MICHAEL watching his son lug

ZABEL

Michael look you want to front

MICHAEL

back He’s living in his in-laws
basement

ZABEL
He’s gotta have something

MICHAEL

Sure He’s got the two kids with
her He’s got Jennifer the coke-
dealing waitress he knocked up --

Make him an offer

His version of sympathy

ZABEL
I had a wife was a drunk Beautiful
girl Young girl But live like that
Even they do a program I think she
did once two years It’s like you’re
strapped to a bomb

MICHAEL
Timmy was sober six years

who’s got a problem

Enough with this They both have places to be

chance I could lay that off Is the
lease worth anything
(pause)
Eighty-nine hundred a month I
mean the fixtures are gone but

Nono I hear you I just

A SILVER FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH Young Arthur Edens with his
wife and baby daughter Some faded happy moment This one
of several very traditional items on a very traditional
desk In fact the whole place is almost disturbingly
repressed The only thing out of place are the dozens of
document boxes piled at the center of the room

MARTY and BARRY GRISSOM digging through all of it Like
they’ve been at it a while

MARTY
I want all this -- everything here
-- I want it all boxed up and sent
to my apartment

MICHAEL in the doorway Watching them plunder Until --

MARTY
(without looking back)
Any luck Michael

BARRY turns surprised MICHAEL steps into the office

MICHAEL
He booked a limo from Newark airport
at three He got out at West Fourth
Street tipped the driver fifty bucks
and walked away

MARTY
You try his place

MICHAEL
It’s a loft There’s no doorman
I rang nobody answered I call
I get the machine

BARRY

So basically he could be anywhere

MICHAEL bites his tongue No love lost with Barry
MARTY
Arthur downtown was not a good idea

You’ve got to saddle up here Michael
and get this under control

MICHAEL
Saddle up

BARRY
He needs to be under a doctor’s care
immediately He needs to be admitted

MICHAEL

BARRY
Does it matter

MARTY
Michael
(the voice of reason)
UNorth needs to know that he’s under
control That he’s in a facility
They’ve been shaken up they need to
be reassured

MICHAEL
It’s just not gonna be that easy

BARRY
Why the hell not

MICHAEL
Because the laws in the State Of New
York set a pretty high threshold for
involuntary commitment

BARRY
Did you see this fucking tape

MICHAEL
I’m not arguing with you Barry I’m
telling you how it is

MARTY
You know what We’ve got six hundred

MARTY
So what So are a lot of people
At this -- what you do -- at this

you’re great For crissake Michael
you have what everybody wants you
have a niche You made a place you
made this niche for yourself And if
it’s nostalgia -- “Oh you should’ve
seen me when I was a DA back in
Queens” -- then let me give you a
serious piece of advice Leave it
there God forbid you’re not as
good as you remember Because I’ve
seen that happen too

But I didn’t come for advice did I

MARTY
So this is what Quid pro quo

You’re tapping my phones

MICHAEL
(it’s to weep)
Jesus Arthur

ARTHUR
Explain it Explain how Marty knows

MICHAEL
You chased this girl through a parking
lot with your dick hanging out You
don’t think she got off the phone with
you and speed-dialed her lawyer

ARTHUR
She wouldn’t do that I know that

MICHAEL
Really You think your judgement is
state-of-the-art right now
(before he can step away)

They’re putting everything on the table
(MORE )

MICHAEL (contd)

here You need to stop and think this
through I will help you think this
through I will find someone to help
you think his through Don’t do this
You’re gonna make it easy for them

ARTHUR draws himself up We saw a glimpse of this in
Milwaukee The teeth The shark beneath the breadloaves

ARTHUR
I have great affection for you
Michael and you lead a very rich and
interesting life but you’re a bagman
not an attorney If your intention
was to have me committed you should’ve
kept me in Wisconsin where the arrest
record videotape and eyewitness
accounts of my inappropriate behavior
had jurisdictional relevance I have
no criminal record in the State of
New York and the crucial determining
criteria for involuntary commitment
is danger “Is the defendant a danger
to himself or others” You think
you’ve got the horses for that Good
luck and God bless But I’1l tell
you this the last place you want to
see me is in court

ARTHUR muscles up his bread He’s leaving

MICHAEL
I’m not the enemy

ARTHUR
Then who are you

And he’s walking MICHAEL almost calling after him Then
not Then nothing Standing on the sidewalk with a baguette
in his hand and a great variety of failures arranging
themselves around his heart

MUSIC blasts from the stereo --

ARTHUR
--One of our all time favorites --
an underground hit that we think is
finally ready for it’s day in the
sunshine Without further ado
United-Northfields Culcitate Internal
Research Memorandum 229

INT MICHAEL’S APARTMENTLIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
HENRY crashed on the couch MICHAEL watching his son sleep

ARTHUR (V0O)

(reading it)
--Conclusion The unanticipated
market growth for Culcitate by small
farms in colder climates demands
further cost-benefit analysis
In-house field studies have indicated
the possibility that smaller short-
season farms with poor drainage
dependent on well-water for human
consumption are at risk for potentially
toxic particulate concentrations

INT THE PANEL TRUCK -- NIGHT

Emergency Arthur’s reading of the memo has spiked the
urgency level in here by a thousand percent IKER working
the console VERNE speed-dialing a cell phone as --

ARTHUR (V0)

-Culcitates great market
advantage that it is tasteless
colorless and does not precipitate
has the potential to mask and
intensify any possible exposures
Further studies and costbenefit
analyses need to concentrate in these
critical follow-up areas

INT KAREN’S HILTON HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

THE PHONE RINGING as the door opens KAREN juggling her
paperwork and sweat clothes rushing to grab it as we hear --

ARTHUR (VO)
- Chemical modification of the

Culcitate product -- the addition of
a detector molecule such as an
odorant or colorant -- would require

a top down retooling of the Culcitate
manufacturing process

EXT SIXTH AVENUE -- NIGHT

Empty midnight KAREN wearing sweat clothes beneath a coat
Clutching a pair of headphones to her ears listening to --

ARTHUR (VO)

These cost while assumed to be
significant were not the subject of
the study summarized here

VERNE standing beside her It’s his Walkman He brought the
tape Waiting for her to finish listening

ARTHUR (VO)

-Clearly the release of these
internal research documents would
compromise the effective marketing of
Culcitate and must be kept within the
protective confines of United
Northfields secret language

And it’s done KAREN takes off the headphones Hands them
back to VERNE She’s dazed She looks ill

VERNE
It seemed to warrant

KAREN
Yes

An awkward beat People carslife going by
KAREN
This justwhatever you doyou
have to contain this

VERNE
Contain

KAREN
Right That’s my question Short
of whatever elsesomething more
What’s the option for something along
those lines

VERNE
You’re talking about paper The data

KAREN
That there’s a more limited option
is what I’m asking
(cold sweat fumbling)
Something I’m not thinking of

VERNE
We deal in absolutes

KAREN
Okay I understand I do

VERNE
The materials I’m not a lawyer we
try We do what we can

KAREN
And the other way

VERNE
Is the other way

Heavy pause Life passing all around them

KAREN
But you think it’s doable

VERNE
We have some good ideas You say
move we move The moment our ideas
don’t look so good we back off and
reassess

KAREN
Okay

VERNE
You mean okay you understand
Or okay proceed
(silence)
Maybe you want to bring Don in on it

KAREN
No

Don’s not in this He’s busy It’s

passages are underlined Notes scrawled here and there in
the margins Pages folded back And then --

A BOOKMARK falls out Fluttering down to the floor
MICHAEL reaches down to pick it up

CLOSE-UP -- THE BOOKMARK It’s a receipt

“COPY MASTERS -- YOUR ONE STOP FOR COPIES”

MICHAEL staring at the receipt Then the book Then the
receipt Then --

OF A POLICE RADIO begins to rattle and --

TWO YOUNG NERVOUS POLICE OFFICERS -- guns drawn -- coming
from the open door --

COPVOICE
-- I said who else is here --

MICHAEL
-- nobody I’m alone --

COP

of a terrible mistake wafting through the air as --

Straining it to the counter

COPY KID

up or something We took a shot

(opening the box)
We ran out of red covers

(handing one over)
We only had two thousand in stock so
the other thousand we did in blue

MICHAEL doesn’t answer because --
IN HIS HAND

A BOOKLET A bright red plastic cover The title

SUMMONS TO CONQUEST

And when he flips it open There it is the by-now-familiar
UNITED-NORTHFIELD MEMO 229 in all it’s ugly splendor

MICHAEL reading the memo Lost in it As we watch the
realization take shape -- how dangeroushow sensitive
how threatening these few sheets of paper must be

COPY KID
(Michael still reading)
It’s okay right

MICHAEL looks up Dazed

MICHAEL
What Yeah It’s fine

COPY KID
You got a van or
(sensing confusion)
There’s like ten boxes

here--)

WERE TRACKING WITH HIM

Power central Normally it’s quiet and subdued up here but
the combination of Arthur’s death the night before and the
sudden paroxysm of activity on the UNorth settlement seems
to have drawn a crowd MICHAEL heading briskly for the
central reception atrium passing ATTORNEYS and SUPPORT STAFF
clustered along the way There’s A WEEPY GROUP bunched near
Arthur’s office and --

ATTORNEY 1
(as Michael goes by)
Did they find you

MICHAEL
Who

ATTORNEY 1
Marty
(pointing around the
corner and--)
I don’t think they went down yet

MICHAEL moving around the corner and into --

INT SENIOR PARTNERS RECEPTION AREA -- DAY (CONT)

THIRTY PEOPLE -- ASSOCIATES SUPPORT PEOPLE ATTORNEYS --
scrambling over STACKS OF PRESENTATION DOCUMENTS -- this
stuff was supposed to be ready for the UNorth meeting and
there’s been some sort of clerical fuck up So now there’s
twenty-five opinions on how to fix it and fifteen
conversations going and nine cell phones ringing and six
people on their knees going through the pages and --

BARRY
(on a mobile phone in
the middle of it all--)
-- so either we cap the interest on
the primary trust or somebody figures
out how to split the custody fees --
(spotting Michael)
-- the audit’s mandatory right --
(covering the phone
calling back over
his shoulder--)
-- Marty --
(then the phone--)
-- no just hang on --
(then to Michael--)
-- he’s been looking for you --
(then back to the
phone as--)

MICHAEL crosses the chaos to the elevator bank and --

MARTY
Your phone is off There’s too much
going on for your phone to be off

MICHAEL
I need a minute

MARTY
(impatient tired)
Yeah well now we’re late so

MICHAEL
We never got to finish last night

MARTY
What’d you do Close the place
You look like hell

MICHAEL
I left right after you did

MARTY

If you say so

(checking his watch)
We’ve been here all night We had
to make an announcement

(turning now--)
Jean Jeannie

(calling to his Assistant

across the way--)
Where’s the thing The envelope

(back to Michael)
So I wanted your input but I couldn’t
get you and I had to pull the trigger
I put Bob Nast and Kim -- which is
probably a mistake -- they’re gonna try
to pull together a memorial service by
the end of the week I told them to
call you if they need help okay

(distracted now because

Jean’s holding something

up for him to see--)
-- no no the other one --

(back to Michael)
So we cut a check for you this
morning but there’s some strings
attached And Barry there’s no way
around it he’s got to be involved

MICHAEL
What if Arthur was onto something

MARTY
What do you mean Onto what

MICHAEL hesitating because here’s JEAN tapping her watch for
MARTY to hurry up as she hands him A SMALL GRAY ENVELOPE --

MICHAEL
UNorth What if Arthur wasn’t just
crazy What if he was right

MARTY
Right about what That were on
the wrong side

MICHAEL
Wrong side Wrong way All of it

MARTY
This is news We’re defending cancer
for crissake The case reeked from
Day One Fifteen years in I’ve got
to tell you how we pay the rent

MICHAEL
What would they do though if they
thought Arthur was gonna go public

MARTY

What would they do Are you fucking
soft They’re doing it

(honestly incredulous)
We don’t straighten this settlement
out in the next twenty-four hours
they’re gonna withhold nine million
dollars in fees they owe us Then
they’re gonna pull out the video of
Arthur’s flashdance in Milwaukee and
sue us for legal malpractice except
there won’t be anything to win because
by that point the merger with London
will be dead and well be selling off
the furniture

(handing Michael the

envelope now--)
That’s eighty We’re calling it a
bonus You’re getting a three year
contract at your current numbers
That’s assuming this all works out

And now before MICHAEL can get his footing here comes --

BARRY
(the envelope)
You’re doing this now

MARTY
(the documents)
Are they ready

BARRY
Almost They’re proofing
(to Michael) )

Look I agreed to this okay

But there’s rules now You want

the contract you’re signing a
confidentiality agreement and it’s
gonna be retroactive and it’s gonna
be bulletproof Because Marty’s too
nice to say it but with everything
you know about this place and the
clients and the people who work here
it makes things just a little too
weird when you come in and ask for
eighty grand

A nasty beat MICHAEL stung Roiling

MICHAEL
If I was gonna shake anybody down
Barry I’d come right to you And it
wouldn’t be for eighty grand
(to Marty)
Is this him or you

BARRY
Hey if I’m wrong I apologize

MICHAEL
You’re wrong You’re way-the-fuck
wrong

BARRY

So there you go

MARTY
Enough Okay Everybody
(to Michael)
He’s an asshole But he knows it
(to Barry)
And you’re on the record Okay

(to both)
Everybody happy

Nobody’s happy And here’s JEAN with a nudge --

JEAN
Don Jeffries is in the conference
room

MARTY
Okay we’re coming
(to Barry)
Tell them to bring the paperwork
down when they’re ready
(to Michael)
Call Bob Nast just see if they need
help with this thing
(starting to walk away
then he stops turns
back--)
You’re welcome

in the fog like ghosts Watching MICHAEL come toward them

large in these eyes Everything he’s done wrong All the
things he hasn’t done Wounded and weary and humbled by the
abundance of his inadequacies It is to weep

Stunned The car -- his car -- is gone -- replaced by a
skeletal shell of fire -- smoke pluming -- little follow-up
explosions popping every couple seconds MICHAEL looks
around Looks back He should be dead He is not

And now as the reality of that sinks in as the smell of
burning car finally reaches him we can see the confusion
drain away All that staggered chaos in Michael’s eyes
suddenly replaced with steel He should be dead He is not

considering settlement numbers

INT NEW YORK HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM -- DAY

and PRIMARY STOCKHOLDERS -- seated in a room that could hold

three hundred Everyone has an information packet and a copy
of the lawsuit deal memo SECURITY GUARDS manning the door

And up front addressing the assembled --
KAREN

(smiling and confident)
-- we’d also discovered that their
legal fees were capped at thirty-two
percent of the judgement up to four
hundred million and dropped to twenty-
four percent after that so we knew
there was this motivational dead zone
in the middle for them

INT NEW YORK HOTEL BEDROOM -- DAY

KAREN
it was also at this time that

We had a meeting in June with the

last June that they’d run the numbers
and that the benefits

INT NEW YORK HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM -- DAY

They’re eating out of her hand

KAREN
-that the tax benefit -- if we could
keep the settlement under six-hundred
million and get it done this fiscal
year -- that the write-off would
essentially pay for itself

Ledeen cap it’s fee at fifty million
and we anticipate no further legal fees

in the closing of this settlement

KAREN (contd)
(pausing for triumph)

The package you have before you
represents in my judgement the very
strongest possible position for our
company under the circumstances As
Chief Counsel it is my recommendation
that the proposal be confirmed

And she’s done And it’s gone very very well Many happy
prosperous faces

Thank you Karen

MICHAEL

I’m not a guy you kill I’m the guy

(that stops her cold)
Are you so fucking blind you don’t see
what I am I’m the easiest part of
your whole problem and you’re gonna
kill me Don’t you know who I am
I’m a fixer I’m a bagman I do
everything from shoplifting wives to
bent congressmen and you’re gonna blow
me up What do you need Karen Lay

Need a heads-up on an insider trading
subpoena Need someone’s name erased
from an escort service list Gota

and a three-year contract and you’re
gonna kill me

MICHAEL
Ten is the number

KAREN

million dollars

MICHAEL

(the memo)
Did you read to the end You see who

and ask Don Jeffries if he wants to
pass the hat for a worthy cause

KAREN is reeling She can hardly breathe

KAREN
Thisit would have to be a longer
conversationand someplace else

MICHAEL
Where My car
(on her hard now)
Let’s make it easy Let’s call it five
to forget about Arthur’s murder

KAREN
Five is easier
(hopeful for a moment)
That would be something that we might
be able to do Five could work

MICHAEL
Great And the other five million is
to forget about the four-hundred-and-
sixty-eight people who got wiped out by
your weedkiller

There’s DON JEFFRIES still carrying on and DALBERTO trying
to calm him down

UNORTH BOARDMEMBERS spilling out of the ballroom to see
what’s going on

KAREN sitting there on the floor in shock like some sort of
accident victim

GENE waiting by the exit Watching MICHAEL come toward him
Headphones around his neck make it clear he’s been listening
to the whole thing

GENE

They trade a look MICHAEL has just torn off his skin
Naked to the world

MICHAEL
I need some air

GENE

MICHAEL nods Walking away as we --

EXT SIXTH AVENUE -- DAY

Rush hour MICHAEL walking -- walking toward the park --
walking through the sea of people and faces as we begin to
hear the crazed manic voice of --

ARTHUR EDENS (VO)
Michael Look at me Michael Look at
me and make believe Make believe it’s
not just madness Because it’s not
just madness

TAIL CREDITS begin --

ARTHUR EDENS (VO)

-I mean yes -- okay yes --
elements of madness -- the speed of
Madness -- yes the occasional
euphoric pseudo-hallucinatory moments
that yes -- fine -- agreed --
distracting -- nostalgic -- all of
that -- but that’s just the package
-- the plate -- think of it as a tax --
The Mania Tax -- The Insanity Tax --
or like advertising on TV -- it’s the
freight -- the weight -- it’s the price
of the show

As we fade out and

THE END
