01004118

ICELAND

POPULATION 320000

GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT 13 BILLION
BANK LOSSES 100 BILLION

01010700

NARRATOR Iceland is a stable democracy with a high standard of living and until

ANDRI MAGNASON We had the complete infrastructure of a modern society clean
energy food production fisheries with a quota system to manage them

GYLFI ZOEGA Good healthcare good education you know clean air uh not much
crime uh its good a good place for families to live

ANDRI MAGNASON We had almost uh end-of-history status
01014015

NARRATOR But in 2000 Icelands government began a broad policy of deregulation
that would have disastrous consequences first for the environment and then for the
economy They started by allowing multinational corporations like Alcoa to build giant
aluminum-smelting plants and exploit Icelands natural geothermal and hydroelectric
energy sources

ANDRI MAGNASON Many of the most beautiful areas in the highlands with the most
spectacular colors are geothermal So nothing comes without consequence

DEMONSTRATOR We have had enough But how could all of this happen
GYLFI ZOEGA Finance took over Um and uh more or less wrecked the place

outside of Iceland borrowed 120 billion dollars ten times the size of Icelands economy
The bankers showered money on themselves each other and their friends

GYLFI ZOEGA There was a massive bubble Stock prices went up by a factor of nine
uh house prices more than doubled

NARRATOR Icelands bubble gave rise to people like Jon Asgeir Johannesson He
borrowed billions from the banks to buy up high-end retail businesses in London He
also bought a pinstriped private jet a 40-million-dollar yacht and a Manhattan
penthouse

01040117

ANDRI MAGNASON Newspapers always had the headline this millionaire bought this
company uh in the UK or in Finland or in in France or wherever uh instead of
saying this millionaire took a billion-dollar loan to buy this company and he took it from
your local bank

01042215

GYLFI ZOEGA The banks set up money market funds And the banks advised deposit-
holders to withdraw money and put them in the money market funds The Ponzi
scheme needed everything it could huh

01043305

NARRATOR American accounting firms like KPMG audited the Icelandic banks and
investment firms and found nothing wrong and American credit-rating agencies said
Iceland was wonderful

SIGRIDUR BENEDIKTSDOTTIR In February 2007 the rating agencies decided to
upgrade the banks to the highest possible rate —- AAA
Inside Job transcript — Sony Pictures — September 2010 3

NARRATOR The government regulators who should have been protecting the citizens
of Iceland had done nothing

GYLFI ZOEGA You have two lawyers from the regulator STUTTER going to a bank
to talk about some issue When they approach the bank they would see 19 uh SUVs
outside heh outside the bank Right So you got to the bank and you have the 19

lawyers sitting uh in front of you right They are very well prepared uh uh ready to
kill any argument you make And then if you do really well they offer you a job right

01060124
NARRATOR One-third of Icelands financial regulators went to work for the banks

an economist named Alan Greenspan In this letter to regulators Greenspan praised
Keatings sound business plans and expertise and said he saw no risk in allowing

GEORGE SOROS
CHAIRMAN
SOROS FUND MANAGEMENT

GEORGE SOROS Markets are inherently unstable or at least potentially unstable An
appropriate metaphor is the oil tankers They are very big and therefore you have to
put in compartments to prevent the sloshing around of oil from capsizing the boat The
design of the boat has to take that into account And after the uh uh Depression the
Inside Job transcript — Sony Pictures — September 2010 16

regulations actually introduced these very ti- watertight compartments And
deregulation has led to the end of co- compartmentalization

01182721

NARRATOR The next crisis came at the end of the 90s The investment banks fueled
a massive bubble in Internet stocks which was followed by a crash in 2001 that caused
5 trillion dollars in investment losses The Securities and Exchange Commission the
federal agency which had been created during the Depression to regulate investment
banking had done nothing

01184910

ELIOT SPITZER In the absence of meaningful federal action — and there has been
none — and given the clear failure of self-regulation it has become necessary for others
to step in and adopt the protections needed

01190024

NARRATOR Eliot Spitzers investigation revealed that the investment banks had
promoted Internet companies they knew would fail Stock analysts were being paid
based on how much business they brought in And what they said publicly was quite

ATTORNEY GENERAL NEW YORK STATE (1999-2007)

And linking them all together was the securitization food chain a new system which
connected trillions of dollars in mortgages and other loans with investors all over the
world

01273412

REP BARNEY FRANK Thirty years ago if you went to get a loan for a home the
person lending you the money expected you to pay him or her back You got a loan
from a lender who wanted you to pay him back Weve since developed securitization
whereby the people who make the loan are no longer at risk if there is a failure to repay

01275121

NARRATOR In the old system when a homeowner paid their mortgage every month
the money went to their local lender And since mortgages took decades to repay
lenders were careful

In the new system lenders sold the mortgages to investment banks The investment
banks combined thousands of mortgages and other loans — including car loans student
loans and credit-card debt — to create complex derivatives called collateralized debt
obligations or CDOs The investment banks then sold the CDOs to investors

Now when homeowners paid their mortgages the money went to investors all over the
world

01283311 The investment banks paid rating agencies to evaluate the CDOs and
many of them were given a AAA rating which is the highest possible investment grade
This made CDOs popular with retirement funds which could only purchase highly rated
securities

01285005 This system was a ticking time bomb Lenders didnt care anymore about
whether a borrower could repay so they started making riskier loans The investment
banks didnt care either the more CDOs they sold the higher their profits And the
rating agencies which were paid by the investment banks had no liability if their ratings
of CDOs proved wrong

GILLIAN TETT
US MANAGING EDITOR
THE FINANCIAL TIMES

GILLIAN TETT You werent gonna be on the hook and there werent regulatory
constraints Um so it was a green light to just pump out more and more and more
loans
Inside Job transcript — Sony Pictures — September 2010 24

NARRATOR Between 2000 and 2003 the number of mortgage loans made each year
nearly quadrupled

NOURIEL ROUBINI Everybody in this uh securitization food chain from the very
beginning until the end they didnt care about the quality of the mortgage they were
caring about maximizing their volume and getting a fee out of it

01294605

NARRATOR In the early 2000s there was a huge increase in the riskiest loans called
subprime But when thousands of subprime loans were combined to create CDOs
many of them still received AAA ratings

01300306

CHARLES FERGUSON Now it would have been possible to create derivative products
that dont have these risks —

GILLIAN TETT Um-hm

CHARLES FERGUSON - that carry the equivalent of deductibles where there are
limits on the risks that can be taken on and so forth They didnt do that did they

01301908
GILLIAN TETT They didnt do that and in retrospect they should have done

CHARLES FERGUSON So did these guys know that they were doing something
dangerous

SAM HAYES think they did

THE INVESTMENT BANKS ACTUALLY PREFERRED SUBPRIME
LOANS BECAUSE THEY CARRIED HIGHER INTEREST RATES
THIS LED TO A MASSIVE INCREASE IN PREDATORY LENDING-

BORROWERS WERE NEEDLESSLY PLACED IN EXPENSIVE
SUBPRIME LOANS AND MANY LOANS WERE GIVEN
TO PEOPLE WHO COULD NOT REPAY THEM

01304412

(2001-2007)

NARRATOR Suddenly hundreds of billions of dollars a year were flowing through the
securitization chain Since anyone could get a mortgage home purchases and housing
prices skyrocketed The result was the biggest financial bubble in history

MAN Real estate is real They can see their asset they can live in their asset they can
rent out their asset

01312705

CHARLES MORRIS You had a huge boom in housing that made no sense at all The
financing appetites of the financial sector drove what everybody else did

NOURIEL ROUBINI Last time we had a housing bubble was in the late 80s In that
case the increase in home price had been relatively minor That housing bubble led to
a relatively severe recession

From 1996 until 2006 real home prices effectively doubled

VOICE OVER At 500 dollars a ticket theyve come to hear how to buy their very own
piece of the American dream

ROBERT GNAIZDA Goldman Sachs Bear Stearns Lehman Brothers Merrill Lynch
were all in on this The uh p- sub- subprime lending alone increased from 30 billion a
year in funding to over 600 billion a year in 10 years They knew what was happening

01323315

NARRATOR Countrywide Financial the largest subprime lender issued 97 billion
dollars’ worth of loans It made over 11 billion dollars in profits as a result
Inside Job transcript — Sony Pictures — September 2010 26

01324622 On Wall Street annual cash bonuses spiked Traders and CEOs became
enormously wealthy during the bubble

Lehman Brothers was a top underwriter of subprime lending and their CEO Richard
Fuld took home 485 million dollars

01330504

NOURIEL ROUBINI On Wall Street this housing and credit bubble was leading uh to
hundreds of billions of dollars of profits You know by 2006 about 40 percent of all
profits of SandP 500 firms was coming from financial institutions

01332009

MARTIN WOLF
CHIEF ECONOMICS COMMENTATOR
THE FINANCIAL TIMES

MARTIN WOLF It wasnt real profits it wasnt real income it was just money that was
being created by the system and booked as income two three years down the road
Theres a default its all wiped out

think this was in fact in retrospect a great big national — and not just national global
— Ponzi scheme

01333827

NARRATOR Through the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act the Federal
Reserve Board had broad authority to regulate the mortgage industry But Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan refused to use it

REP BARNEY FRANK Alan Greenspan said no thats regulation ideologically dont
believe in it

NARRATOR For 20 years Robert Gnaizda was the head of Greenlining a powerful
consumer advocacy group He met with Greenspan on a regular basis

01340417

ROBERT GNAIZDA We gave him an example of Countrywide and 150 different
complex adjustable-rate mortgages And he said If you had a doctorate in math you
wouldnt be able to understand them enough to know which was good for you and which
wasnt
Inside Job transcript — Sony Pictures — September 2010 27

So we thought he was gonna take action But as the conversation continued it was
clear he was stuck with his ideology

We met again with Greenspan in 05 Often we met with him twice a year and never
less than once a year And he wouldnt change his mind

INVESTMENT BANKS DURING THE BUBBLE

OCTOBER 7 2008

REP PETER WELCH A hundred and forty six people were cut from the enforcement
division of the e- SEC is that what you also testified to

LYNN E TURNER
FORMER CHIEF ACCOUNTANT
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

LYNN E TURNER Yes Yeah think there has been a a a systematic gutting or
whatever you want to call it of the agency and its capability through cutting back of
staff

01352003

REP PETER WELCH The SEC Office of uh Risk Management was reduced to a staff
did you say of one

LYNN E TURNER Yeah When that gentleman would go home at night he could turn
the lights out
Inside Job transcript — Sony Pictures — September 2010 28

01353317

NARRATOR During the bubble the investment banks were borrowing heavily to buy
more loans and create more CDOs

The ratio between borrowed money and the banks own money was called leverage
The more the banks borrowed the higher their leverage

In 2004 Henry Paulson the CEO of Goldman Sachs helped lobby the Securities and
Exchange Commission to relax limits on leverage allowing the banks to sharply
increase their borrowing

01360514

KENNETH ROGOFF
PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS HARVARD

KENNETH ROGOFF The SEC somehow decided to let investment banks gamble a lot
more That was nuts dont know why they did that but they did that

ON APRIL 28 2004 THE SEC MET TO CONSIDER
LIFTING LEVERAGE LIMITS ON THE INVESTMENT BANKS

01362120

COMMISSIONER HARVEY J GOLDSCHMID Weve said these are the big guys and
clearly thats true But that means if anything goes wrong its going to be an awfully big
mess

DIRECTOR ANNETTE L NAZARETH At these levels you obviously are dealing with
the most highly sophisticated financial institutions

01363713

COMMISSIONER ROEL C CAMPOS These are the firms that do most of the
derivative activity in the United States We talked to some of them as to what their
comfort level was

DIRECTOR ANNETTE L NAZARETH The firms actually thought that the number was
uh appropriate

CHAIRMAN WILLIAM DONALDSON Do the commissioners vote to adopt the rule
amendments and new rules as recommended by the staff
Inside Job transcript — Sony Pictures — September 2010 29

ALL Yes

WILLIAM DONALDSON We do indeed Unanimous
And we are adjourned

01370300

DANIEL ALPERT
MANAGING DIRECTOR
WESTWOOD CAPITAL

DANIEL ALPERT The degree of leverage in the financial system uh became
absolutely frightening investment banks leveraging up to the level of you know 33 to 1
Uh which means that a tiny 3-percent decrease in the value of their asset base would
leave them insolvent

01372210

NARRATOR There was another ticking time bomb in the financial system AIG the
worlds largest insurance company was selling huge quantities of derivatives called
credit default swaps

For investors who owned CDOs credit default swaps worked like an insurance policy
An investor who purchased a credit default swap paid AIG a quarterly premium If the
CDO went bad AIG promised to pay the investor for their losses

01375223 But unlike regular insurance speculators could also buy credit default
swaps from AIG in order to bet against CDOs they didnt own

01380413

SATYAJIT DAS In insurance you can only insure something you own Lets say you
and own property own a house can only insure that house once The derivatives
universe essentially enables anybody to actually insure that house So you could insure
that somebody else could do that So 50 people might insure my house

So what happens is if my house burns down now the number of losses in the system
becomes proportionately larger

0138310

NARRATOR Since credit default swaps were unregulated AIG didnt have to put aside
any money to cover potential losses Instead AIG paid its employees huge cash
Inside Job transcript — Sony Pictures — September 2010 30

bonuses as soon as contracts were signed But if the CDOs later went bad AIG would
be on the hook

NOURIEL ROUBINI People were essentially being rewarded for taking massive risks
Uh in good times they generate short-term revenues and profits and therefore
bonuses But thats gonna lead to the firm to be bankrupt over time Thats a totally
distorted system of compensation

01390713

NARRATOR AIGs Financial Products Division in London issued 500 billion dollars
worth of credit default swaps during the bubble many of them for CDOs backed by
subprime mortgages

The 400 employees at AIGFP made 35 billion dollars between 2000 and 2007 Joseph
Cassano the head of AIGFP personally made 315 million dollars

01393400

JOSEPH CASSANO ON AN AIG CONFERENCE CALL
WITH INVESTORS AUGUST 2007

JOSEPH CASSANO Its hard for us with and with without being flippant to even see
a scenario within any kind of realm of reason that would see us losing one dollar in any
of those transactions

01394805

NARRATOR In 2007 AIGs auditors raised warnings One of them Joseph St Denis
resigned in protest after Cassano repeatedly blocked him from investigating AIGFPs
accounting

REP HENRY WAXMAN Let me tell you one person that didnt get a bonus while
everybody else was getting bonuses

HENRY WAXMAN

were running into big problems He quit in frustration and he didnt get a bonus

NARRATOR In 2005 Raghuram Rajan then the chief economist of the International
Monetary Fund delivered a paper at the annual Jackson Hole Symposium the most
elite banking conference in the world

CHARLES FERGUSON Who was in the audience

RAGHURAM RAJAN
CHIEF ECONOMIST (2003-2007)
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND (IMF)

RAGHURAM RAJAN It was uh guess the central bankers of the world Um ranging
from Mr Greenspan himself Ben Bernanke Larry Summers was there Tim Geithner
was there

The title of the paper was essentially Is Financial Development Making the World
Riskier And the conclusion was uh it is

01405515

NARRATOR Rajans paper focused on incentive structures that generated huge cash
bonuses based on short-term profits but which imposed no penalties for later losses
Rajan argued that these incentives encouraged bankers to take risks that might
eventually destroy their own firms or even the entire financial system

01411829

RAGHURAM RAJAN Its very easy to generate performance by taking on more risk
And so what you need to do is compensate for risk-adjusted performance And thats
where all the bodies are buried

KENNETH ROGOFF
PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS HARVARD

01413012

KENNETH ROGOFF Rajan wa- you know hit the nail on the head What he
particularly said was you guys have claimed you have found a way to make more profits
with less risk say youve found a way to make more profits with more risk and theres
a big difference

01414526

RAGHURAM RAJAN Summers was was vocal He basically thought that was
criticizing the change in the financial world and was worried about uh you know
regulation which would reverse this whole change So essentially he accused me of
Inside Job transcript — Sony Pictures — September 2010 32

being a Luddite He wanted to make sure that we didnt bring in a whole new set of
regulations to constrain the financial sector at that point

where the prize is money And they noticed that when these subjects earn money the
part of the brain that gets stimulated is the same part that cocaine stimulates

01453824

JONATHAN ALPERT A lot of people feel that they need to really participate in that
behavior to make it to get promoted to get recognized

percent of revenue for New York derivatives brokers and often includes strip clubs

ALLAN SLOAN
SENIOR EDITOR
FORTUNE MAGAZINE

ALLAN SLOAN A friend of mine who whos involved in a company that has a big
financial presence said Well its about time you learned about subprime mortgages
So he set up a session with his trading desk and me and and a techie who who did all
this — gets very excited runs to his computer pulls up in about three seconds this
Goldman Sachs issue of securities

It was a complete disaster Borrowers had borrowed on average 993 percent of the
price of the house Which means they have no money in the house If anything goes
wrong theyre gonna walk away from the mortgage

01481117 This is not a loan youd really make right Youve gotta be crazy

But somehow you took 8000 of these loans and by the time the guys were done at
Goldman Sachs and the rating agencies two-thirds of the loans were rated AAA which
meant they were rated as safe as government securities Its its utterly mad

01483318

NARRATOR Goldman Sachs sold at least 31 billion dollars worth of these toxic CDOs
in the first half of 2006 The CEO of Goldman Sachs at this time was Henry Paulson
the highest-paid CEO on Wall Street

01484919
MAY 30 2006

GEORGE W BUSH COUGH Good morning welcome to the White House am
pleased to announce that will nominate Henry Paulson to be the secretary of the
Treasury He has a lifetime of business experience he has an intimate knowledge of
financial markets he has earned a reputation for candor and integrity

01490408
Inside Job transcript — Sony Pictures — September 2010 37

NARRATOR You might think it would be hard for Paulson to adjust to a meager
government salary But taking the job as Treasury secretary was the best financial
decision of his life

Paulson had to sell his 485 million dollars of Goldman stock when he went to work for
the government But because of a law passed by the first President Bush he didnt have
to pay any taxes on it It saved him 50 million dollars

01493024

IN 2007 ALAN SLOAN PUBLISHED AN ARTICLE ABOUT
THE CDOs ISSUED DURING PAULSONS LAST MONTHS AS CEO

ALLAN SLOAN The article came out in October of 2007 Already a third of the
mortgages defaulted Now uh most of them are goin’

01494916

NARRATOR One group that had purchased these now-worthless securities was the
Public Employees Retirement System of Mississippi which provides monthly benefits to
over 80000 retirees They lost millions of dollars and are now suing Goldman Sachs

AVERAGE ANNUAL RETIREMENT BENEFITS
FOR A MISSISSIPPI PUBLIC EMPLOYEE 18750

AVERAGE ANNUAL COMPENSATION OF A
GOLDMAN SACHS EMPLOYEE 600000

HANK PAULSONS COMPENSATION IN 2005 31000000
01501927

NARRATOR By late 2006 Goldman had taken things a step further It didnt just sell
toxic CDOs it started actively betting against them at the same time it was telling
customers that they were high-quality investments

01503502 By purchasing credit default swaps from AIG Goldman could bet against
CDOs it didnt own and get paid when the CDOs failed

01504526

ALLAN SLOAN asked them if anybody called the customers and said you know we
dont really like this kind of mortgage anymore and we thought you ought to know you
Inside Job transcript — Sony Pictures — September 2010 38

know They they didnt really say anything but you know you could just feel the
laughter coming over the phone

01510111

NARRATOR Goldman Sachs bought at least 22 billion dollars of credit default swaps
from AIG It was so much that Goldman realized that AIG itself might go bankrupt so
they spent 150 million dollars insuring themselves against AIGs potential collapse

Then in 2007 Goldman went even further They started selling CDOs specifically
designed so that the more money their customers lost the more money Goldman Sachs
made

against and its now being sued by the government employees retirement fund of the
Virgin Islands for fraud

The lawsuit alleges that Morgan Stanley knew that the CDOs were junk Although they
were rated AAA Morgan Stanley was betting they would fail A year later Morgan
Stanley had made hundreds of millions of dollars while the investors had lost almost all

01553202
Inside Job transcript — Sony Pictures — September 2010 42

BILL ACKMAN Moodys and SandP get compensated based on putting out ratings
reports And the more structured securities they gave a AAA rating to the higher their
earnings were gonna be for the quarter

DOMINIQUE STRAUSS-KAHN attended a very interesting uh dinner organized by
Hank Paulson a little more than one year ago uh with some officials and a couple of
uh CEOs from the biggest uh banks in the US And uh surprisingly enough all these
gentlemen were arguing uh we were too greedy so we have part responsibility Fine

And then they were turning to the treasurer to the secretary of the Treasury and say
you should regulate more because we are too greedy we cant avoid it The only way
to avoid this is to have more regulation

political influence in the United States

on lobbying and campaign contributions And since the crisis theyre spending even
more money

02223007 The financial industry also exerts its influence in a more subtle way one
that most Americans dont know about It has corrupted the study of economics itself

the main source of that illusion
