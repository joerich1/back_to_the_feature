EXT FIELD - DAWNTHANKSGIVING
A deer hops through waist-high grass not far from

KELLER DOVER camouflage hunting rifle in hand A
serious man imposing still built like a prize fighter
at 37

He doesn’t move a muscle letting his son take the
shot

RALPH DOVER 15 aims his rifle a little shaky still
learning He squeezes the trigger -- POP POP --

The deer stumbles towards us shot in the neck It backs
up and collapses The high grass hides its final moments
in a canopy of swaying tendrils

EXT HIGHWAY - LATER

Still early morning A pick-up truck barrels down the
highway On the tailgate in painted letters it says
KELLER DOVER REMODELING and REPAIRS

From above we see the shot deer lying in the pick-up’s
flatbed

INT KELLER’S TRUCK - TRAVELING

Keller drives Ralph sits in the passenger seat The
Everyday Testament is playing while Keller talks over it

KELLER
Most important thing your Grandpa
ever taught me Be ready
Hurricane flood whatever it ends
up being No more food gets
delivered to the grocery store
gas stations dry up People turn
on one another and all of a sudden
all that stands between you and
being dead is you

He looks at Ralph Ralph nods idolizes his father even
if he barely understands him Keller nods back not
finished not satisfied but done talking He turns the
Everyday Testament up --

The RV turns onto Fairmount Circle creeping past modest
houses with slush covered lawns past KELLER DOVER’S
HOUSE his pick-up truck parked in the driveway

The RV disappears around the bend as

don’t understand the questions

something -- all the furniture has been removed There’s
a homemade book on the floor with a familiar cover
FINISH ALL THE MAZES AND YOU CAN GO HOME

Joy starts to stand up -- HER VISION DISTORTING -- THE
MORE SHE MOVES THE MORE DISTORTED HER VISION BECOMES
She struggles to steady herself -- her vision normalizes
enough that she can discern the door is ajar

There’s a knocked over 2-liter bottle of what looks like
grape-aid on the floor -- its purple contents have

spilled out beneath the crack in the door alerting their
captor to the mess There’s a mop leaned against the
wall someone in the middle of cleaning up the grape-aid -
- whoever it is can be heard in the kitchen using the
sink there’s a TV going somewhere --

Joy start shaking Anna -- gets her to wake up -- points
to the door Anna is too out of it to move Joy pulls
her up -- helps her --

Joy pulls Anna out the door -- everything starts spinning
and distorting as they enter the hallway --

Joy blindly feels the wall moving through the morphing
interior -- Anna starting to lag

Then Joy’s hand finds a door knob she looks up and sees
sunlight blasting in through the window glass on the top
of the door -- a way out Joy tries the knob -- it’s
locked She fumbles with the little turn lock on the
door knob -- unlocks the door --

Makes people lose their faith

POLICE OFFICER -- I NEED HELP

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - ST CELESTINE HOSPITAL - DAY

A patient lies in his hospital bed his face obscured by
the newspaper he’s reading

BARRY MILLAND AKA ALEX JONES
REUNITED WITH FAMILY AFTER 27 YEARS

A picture of Jones in the hospital his beard shaved off
revealing a previously hidden resemblance to the photos
of him at seven years old

Below that is another headline STILL MISSING
A picture of Keller

The patient folds up the paper It’s Loki oxygen tubes
in his nostrils bandages over his wound Someone
approaches his bedside

It’s Grace pushing Anna in a wheelchair Anna is dressed
in hospital pajamas remnants of shock still clouding her
eyes

LOKI
Hello
She doesn’t answer
GRACE
She’s doing real good -- be on her

feet in a few days

Behind them are Nancy and Joy Grace seems possessed of
some newfound strength while Nancy seems withered and
shaky

GRACE (CONTD)
I hope we’re not intruding
Anna wanted to see her hero

Anna stares at Loki unable to speak He offers her his
hand noticing shes wearing a red whistle around her
neck She shakes his hand regarding him like an
apparition

And while she does Loki looks over at Nancy picking up
on the guilt that’s underlying her expression She
senses him reading her and looks away --

Nancy leaves with the girls

Nancy walks out with the girls Eliza is there Ralph by

imploring him with a silent plea -- a plea Franklin looks
to be struggling against

Franklin suddenly breaks Nancy’s gaze -- walks to a
UNIFORM COP posted at the end of the hall

GRACE (CONT’D)
He did what he had to do for Anna
And I thank God that he did

Loki doesn’t answer the two of them sharing the silence
until

GRACE (CONTD)
He’s a good man

And with that she abruptly walks out

Loki picks the newspaper back up He looks at the
picture of Keller

EXT BACK YARD - HOLLY JONES’ HOUSE - NIGHT

It’s the middle of the night The sound of GENERATORS
HUMMING powering industrial spot lights illuminating
the back yard as snow falls

The Trans Am has not been moved The seats have been
ripped out lying next to the car

Closer to the house two tired looking FORENSIC TECHS
late twenties kneel on the ground scraping at the frozen
soil -- they have a radio on working to classical music -

The back door opens and out walks Loki head bandaged
He looks broken left the hospital too early

He surveys the backyard

LOKI
Find anything

Tech 1 holds up a plastic bag Inside is a frozen
partially decomposed snake

Prisoners - Full Pink Script - 11713 119

TECH 1
Just this so far Ground’s frozen
solid It’s gonna take us weeks
to excavate the whole property

Loki surveys the yard for a moment with a weary
expression

LOKI
Pray for the best Prepare for
the worst

Finished for the night Tech 1 shuts off the spotlights
and with a loud CLICK CLACK the back yard goes dark

Tech 2 shuts off the radio and follows his cohort into
the house Loki hangs back It’s dead quiet now

Loki walks around the yard He takes a closer look at
the Trans Am staring into its gutted interior
thinking

He walks back towards the house looking bothered by
something his mind grinding gears

He takes a last look at the moonlit yard then turns
around about to enter the house -- when he hears
something

It’s very faint but almost sounds like a whistle
Loki turns around Could have been the wind but

There it is again It’s coming from the Trans Am

Loki walks through the snow to the Trans Am dread
blossoming in his eyes He hears the whistle again and
picks up the pace almost there as we --

FADE TO BLACK

EXT BACK YARD - HOLLY JONES’ HOUSE - NIGHT

Loki looks underneath the Trans Am at the sheet of
plywood it’s parked on He reaches under and knocks on
it -- hears the hollow sound -- his eyes go wide --

Loki springs up yells to the two Forensic Techs inside
the house --

LOKI
There’s something under the car
The two Techs emerge from the back door -- to see Loki
reaching into the Trans Am -- shifting it into neutral --

LOKI (CONT’D)
Come on -- help me --

The two Techs rush to join Loki at the rear of the car --
all three pushing straining -- until it starts to roll --

The snow encrusted back tires clear the sheet of plywood
Loki drags the plywood off the hole --

Loki and the two Techs stare down in shocked disbelief

TECH 1
Holy shit
Loki’s POV Keller slumped at the bottom of the pit half
frozen eyes closed -- the red whistle in his lap
LOKI

(to the Techs)
Call an ambulance And get some
blankets Go

The two Techs rush off --

LOKI (CONT’D)
Mr Dover -- can you hear me

Keller doesn’t respond but Loki can see his breath
showing in the cold

Loki considers then after a moment he sits down on the
edge of the hole -- starts lowering himself down -- drops
the remaining couple of feet

Loki goes to Kellersees the gunshot wound in Keller’s
thigh his pants crusted with dried blood --

Loki gives Keller a little shake feeling his neck for a
pulse when --

Keller’s eyes open -- his stare distant and clouded as he
meets Loki’s eyes

LOKI (CONT’D)
She’s OK -- we found her She’s
OK

Keller gives an almost imperceptible nod -- his breathing
shallow his pallor grey and frosted over

LOKI (CONTD)
You gotta hold on a little longer
-- OK Just a little longer

Keller doesn’t answer closes his eyes -- a peaceful
countenance emerging in his expression -- the life
draining out of him

Loki grips Keller’s hand

The two of them sit there at the bottom of the pit
waiting for help to arrive as the snow falls

FADE TO BLACK
