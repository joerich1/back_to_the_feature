FADE IN

EXT ALIEN DESERT WORLD - DAY

A hot wind kicks up plumes of sand MUSIC rises as we SWEEP
across endless dunes TRIBAL DRUMS pounding in the distance

BEGIN MAIN TITLES
We CLIP the crest of a dune Down and up another

A BOY’S VOICE
In this strange and forbidding world
one creature walks alone

We stop on a four-toed footprint filling with sand Just the
WHISTLE of the wind And then a keening CRY

A CLAW breaks through the sand Giant reptilian The whole
body crashes over the rise tail slashing across the dune Its
eyes swivel in separate directions

A BOYS VOICE
He follows a compass only he can see
to a place he does not know

A WHITE WORM falls from the orange sky wriggling as it hits the
sand The lizard’s thick tongue shoots out Sucks it in

The DRUMS thunder as we look up to the heavens where a giant
face stares down at us

INT EMPTY BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Looking into the terrarium eleven-year old BILLY FORRESTER
drops another meal worm down on the iguana making appropriate
ALIEN MONSTER noises

BILLY
He has taken the sacrifice The
village is saved

His two-year old SISTER watches wide-eyed from the doorway
She’s spoiling the mood

BILLY
Go away Katie Amscray

She doesn’t budge Ignoring her Billy rifles through numbered
packing boxes Gives up his search
EXT FRONT OF THE HOUSE - DAY

A pristine New England town picketfenceville Washed cars
well-groomed lawns The kind of place where everyone gets The
New Yorker and not just for the cartoons

Afternoon heat rises off the streets stick-to-your-back hot
Billy ducks under a couch as MOVERS carry it in Katie dogs his
heels

INT BACK OF MOVING VAN - DAY

Dusty and sweating Billy’s mom CHRISTINE slides a heavy box
across the floor She’s young and athletic At the moment
exhausted Billy looks in over the sill

BILLY
Mom where are my comic books

CHRISTINE
Your dad has the list Are you
watching Katie

He’s already gone

EXT ON THE LAWN - DAY

Carrying a giant box a DIMWITTED MOVER bumps into the mailbox
Blocked he pushes harder and harder bending back the post
Finally Billy’s dad MITCH rescues him directing him towards the
house

MITCH
That goes in the kitchen The room
with the sink and the stove
(beat)
Just put it anywhere

The Mover Guy trudges through the flowers heading for the
house Three other NEIGHBORHOOD FATHERS stand near Mitch

COACH MCGUIRE
So if your wife is the new principal
what do you do

MITCH
Well you know that That is something
were figuring out I’m figuring out

MR SAINT-CLAIRE’s videocamera WHIRS as he zooms out He’s
taping everything
COACH MCGUIRE
It’s for that video show You know
the 100000 grand prize
CONSTABLE JACKSON
He tapes everything You figure
somebody’s gotta fall down sometime
Billy tugs on his dad’s sleeve

BILLY
Dad where are my comic books

MITCH
My son Billy

BILLY
Hi Hi Hi Where

MITCH

Box 19 I think it’s inside already
Billy takes off He points a finger back at Katie

Saint-Claire rushes in with his videocamera Billy spots a
promising box Turns it to find then number Nope

INT SECOND STORY BEDROOM - DAY

Billy pokes through the boxes nothing He looks out the window
at the quiet boring treelined street Just a little wistful

That’s when he sees A BLACK KID his age jump the fence into the
back yard He starts filling two squirtguns from the Forrester
hose

EXT BACK YARD —- DAY

Billy walks out to the kid who hasn’t seen him He’s about to
say something when the water-gunman turns on him The kid TOM
JACKSON has a smear of blue paint across his forehead

TOM
Blue or red

BILLY
I dunno We just moved in

Tom considers this for a second

TOM
You’re blue now

He wipes some of the paint off his forehead and onto Billys
Hands him one of the squirtguns

TOM
Red controls Maple Ash and Pine We
lose Hickory and it’s all over

Billy stares at his gun confused Hands it back

BILLY
Hold on

He races back inside the house Tom follows

INT FAMILY ROOM - DAY

open digging out the Super Soaker 9000 an impressive piece of
water-fighting technology

closed firing Keeps shooting until his pistol runs dry

Opens his eyes Joe towers over him big enough to block the
sun His shirt is soaked

JOE
You didn’t get me Got it

The Cowlicked Kid nods

JOE
Gimme your shirt

The Cowlicked Kid peels off his beloved Mr Bubble shirt

his legs and falls on his masterpiece drenched

regains his composure we PULL OUT We are now in Billyvision

At the far end of the racks Suzie finally notices the pack of
boys staring at her It’s creepy

BILLY
So anyway there’s these two guys
hunting

Suzie finishes locking up and leaves Like moths to a flame
the boys all move toward the bike leaving Billy alone with his
joke

INT PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - DAY

Christine unpacks books onto a shelf Finishing one box she
cuts open another with a giant utility knife sweeping so fast
that the blade sticks into her desk She struggles to get it

free her frustration increasing

God bless her she’s about as coordinated as a drunken Stooge
Bracing with a foot for leverage she tries to pull it loose
Her shoulder bumps into the shelf It falls Twelve textbooks
rain down on her the final one beaning her on the head

INT SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Three LITTLE GIRLS in starched dresses carry bouquets of
dandelions They knock on Christine’s door pushing it open

THE GIRLS
(singing)
Hello hello and welcome welcome
welcome to our school

Back turned eyes wide and maniacal Christine yanks the knife
with a mighty GRUNT It pops free spinning her to reveal her
guests

They SCREAM One girl drops her dandelions The other two run
Finally the third follows Christine makes it to the door

CHRISTINE
(still reeling)
Wait Come back Come ba-a-a-ack

She slumps back into her office pressing her head against the
door to squeeze out the pain Her eyes are crossed

A WOMAN’S VOICE
You must be Christine

Blurry at first the WOMAN comes into focus

WOMAN
I’m Eveylne Saint-Claire I’ma “mom”
In your hair already

CHRISTINE
No it’s
(dizzy)
It’s great to meet you

Still dazed she sets the knife down to shake hands Mrs Saint-
Claire is a handsome woman with a Breck Girl smile and the
emotional stability of an abused hummingbird

MRS SAINT-CLAIRE

I have two kids Twins Suzie and
Alan Both are what you’d call

(“air quotes”)
“special needs” My daughter Suzie is
very bright She’s been tested
What’s a number I know It was 140
And because of her abilities her peers
sometimes have trouble relating to her
You understand Jealousy

Christine nods Mrs Saint-Claire examines the struggling
spider plant on Christine’s desk

MRS SAINT-CLAIRE
Alan my son has a diagnosed attention
deficit disorder and also a bit of
wellI don’t want to blame his
teachers or the curriculum but
frankly he needed a whole-language
approach This phonics concept it
didn’t “hook” him

A beat When Mrs Saint-Claire looks back up we see tears
hanging in her eyes They came out of nowhere Her voice
cracks a little

MRS SAINT-CLAIRE
Second grade we would be at the dinner
table and he would start making random
vowel sounds “Daa daaa DOO DOO dee”
This would go on for hours on end It
was heartbreaking

Christine doesn’t know how to handle this weeping woman

CHRISTINE
What grade are they in now

MRS SAINT-CLAIRE
Fifth

CHRISTINE
My son Billy is a fifth-grader Hes
in their class

Mrs Saint-Claire smiles beatifically now happy tears

MRS SAINT-CLAIRE
Then you understand You know what I’m
going through

She rips the last dead leaves off the plant and puts it on the
windowsill just so With her back turned Christine WINCES from
the still-intense head pain

MRS SAINT-CLAIRE

I need to tell you that there were some
parents well-meaning parents who were
worried that since your last job was at
a school of mostly

(which word)
--urban children you might somehow
bring those types of problems problems
with you Drugs and gangs and crack
I told them what I’m going to tell you
I think kids are kids And each one of
them is a unique little problem to
solve

Christine tries to find something to say but Mrs Saint-Claire
fills the silence

MRS SAINT-CLAIRE
People ask me other mothers ask me
Eveylne how can you sacrifice so much
of your time for your kids Don’t you
want to go shopping to the movies
take a little time for yourself Guess
what It’s not a sacrifice at all My
kids are my life They are And when
they tell me “Mom you’re the best” I
say no I’m not I just have the best
kids in the world and that makes it so
easy

Christine smiles

MRS SAINT-CLAIRE
I’ll go I know you’re busy I just
wanted to say “Hi”

CHRISTINE
It was good to meet you

They shake as Mrs Saint-Claire leaves Alone at last
Christine squeezes her temples The pain is palpable

MRS SAINT-CLAIRE
(leaning back in)
Christine

She jumps
MRS SAINT-CLAIRE

I just wanted to say I think we’re
going to be great friends

other boys walk away

ON THE BENCHES

Tom looks up from his baseball cards Billy looks over Tom
goes back to his trading

From the softball diamond Joe motions for Billy to come over
He’s hanging out with Alan and few of his cronies As Billy
approaches Joe tosses a Coke can in the air SMASHES it with a
bat launching it into left field Hands the bat to Billy

Billy kicks his feet in the dirt getting his footing VARIOUS
ANGLES The Girls The Boys All eyes are on him

Billy tosses up a can swings Misses by a mile Joe LAUGHS
The recess bell RINGS Billy tosses up another can Swings and
connects

BILLY
That’s the bell We gotta go in

A beat as the playground empties Joe and Billy hold their

ground Finally they start heading in Joe tosses up a rock

JOE
Watch this

He connects with a Babe Ruth swing We RUSH with the rock as it
hurtles toward the school The windows Billy closes his eyes
Alan grins maniacally as

whole thing She holds for a moment a moral quandary

INT PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - DAY

Billy sits alone in dread Overhead a fluorescent light
FLICKERS The clock TICKS menacingly

He turns around a picture frame on Christine’s desk a photo of
his family on a camping trip Suddenly the frame falls down
Grabbing for it he knocks over a house plant Dirt everywhere
He kicks it under a chair Sets the plant down It teeters
over crashing into a Snapple

He frantically tries to blot up the spill Halfway into
dabbing he looks to see what papers he’s using Attendance
sheets

He sits back on the counter trying to sort them out His butt
hits a switch A red light turns on --

precious hair worriedly

bad bounce Christine catches the ball for them The girls
stare at her in wide-eyed horror She smiles Three of the
girls back away in terror

open gaps -- he’s being shut out Billy takes a chair at the
short end of the table

JOE

Billy surrenders the chair still no place to sit Finally
Suzie moves her tray to create an open space Billy ends up
sitting in the middle of the girls’ section It’s humiliating

like jerky The boys watch fascinated as he chews 15 times
and swallows He licks the inside of his mouth to get rid of
the taste

JOE
Doesn’t count unless it stays down

The kids lean a little closer waiting to see if he’s going to
choke or die or what Billy looks around unsure himself

His lower lip begins to tremble His jaw Then his whole head
His arms start to quake Everyone takes a step back
Pre-hurling chest contractions

WEEZER

Kids cram against the back wall backs turned Billy’s whole
body begins to convulse a standing seizure An inhuman
RETCHING sound Then

With a thumbtack Tom is frantically trying to pin something
down It’s an earthworm He pins it back to the cardboard

He and Billy are lab partners for worm-dissection Nearby are
Suzie and Gretchen Joe and Alan

MISS OVERHOLSER
Next we’re going to bisect the worm
along the axis

Mistaking it for the chalk she SCRAPES the scalpel across the
chalkboard The class SCREAMS With a sudden CHOP Joe hacks
his worm in half

JOE
Hey Alan We got a bisexual worm

Billy and Tom look into their open worm its skin pinned back
It’s not a pretty picture

MISS OVERHOLSER
You’1l notice the digestive system of
the worm is essentially a tube Dirt
and food matter enters through one
orifice is processed and digested by
enzymes then is expelled as waste
matter through the other orifice

HICKS
Wazzat mean

WEEZER
It’s crap

JOE
(leaning over)
Hey Forrester Hungry

Billy ignores him Nauseous he picks at something with the
blade

The other boys huddle close staring

binoculars The largest group of kids yet is gathered at the

TOM
What do you mean It’s a s’more

It is a s’more Tom pokes the worm back into the melted
marshmallow

BILLY
What if it’s y’know working on

JOE
Either way you gotta eat the whole
thing
TOM

Hey Joe Read between the lines

chocolate and marshmallow goo He sucks it in and swallows

FOYER AT THE DOOR

Stepping back from the peephole she opens the door to reveal

MISS OVERHOLSER
Cyrus McKewin It’s after nine

CYRUS is a Scottish gentleman of 83 years He looks up to her
tears in his eyes

MISS OVERHOLSER
Oh Cyrus it’s not your mother

CYRUS
She’s dead Kate just this evening
The angels came at four past eight

A respectful beat Then suddenly

CYRUS
Marry me Kate Elope with me tonight
We’ll see the sun come up in Paris and
set in Rome

MISS OVERHOLSER
Cyrus

Tears fill her eyes She flees into the next room out of
sight Cyrus is heartbroken

CYRUS
Surely there can be no one left to
raise eye at us to give reason we
cannot wed Our love buried them all
(realizing crestfallen)
Unless you don’t believe a Catholic and
a Luteran can have any hope together
Miss Overholser returns A beat

EXT AIRPORT - NIGHT

CROSSFADE TO

INT CLASSROOM - DAY

We SWEEP PAST the empty blackboard to reveal the fifth-graders
most in their seats a few pacing Joe bounces a ball against
the closets Billy checks his watch then the clock

There’s no substitute No adult at all

GELMAN
What if she’s dead

SUZIE
If she’s dead they would send a
substitute

HICKS
What if she’s dead and nobody knows
she’s dead

WEEZER
What if she’s fallen and can’t get up

SUZIE
She’s probably just sick

TOM
Maybe the substitute got lost

GELMAN
Maybe the substitute is dead

Weezer gestures “good point”

GRETCHEN
We have to tell somebody that theres

no teacher

JOE
Like who

GRETCHEN
Like Billy’s mom

All eyes go to Billy He’s not touching it We look past Billy

to Gelman

GELMAN
What if Billy’s mom killed them both

JOE
We don’t have to tell anybody anything
We’re just going to sit here until
something happens

He says it with a certainty that shuts everyone up Everyone
except Gretchen

GRETCHEN
What does Billy think

JOE
Who cares what Billy thinks

ALAN
Yeah Who cares

BILLY
I’m cool with just hanging out I
guess

Joe gestures “see”

SUZIE
We should vote We should vote on
whether we’re going to tell anybody or
not
(off boys’ groans)
It’s the right thing to do

JOE

All in favor of not voting raise your
hand

All the boys raise their hands They outnumber the girls
Suzie gives up disgusted

TOM
Maybe Joe’s right As long as we don’t
screw around nobody’s going to know
the teacher’s not here We just have
to play it cool

CUT TO

TITLE OVER BLACK FIVE MINUTES LATER

A volley of spitballs rains down as Weezer and Hicks wrestle in
the aisle knocking over desks as they go The Cowlicked Kid
barely avoids getting crushed

JOE
Go long

From across the room Joe passes the football to Alan who isn’t
paying any attention The ball knocks down a hanging fern dirt
everywhere

The girls wince standing up on their chairs out of the way
In its cage the hamster runs frantically on his exercise wheel

Gelman opens the bottom drawer of the teacher’s desk It’s like
the Ark of the Covenant

GELMAN
It’s all here

Fourteen hands reach in to pull out 40 years of contraband
dart guns pocket knives comic books

Tom tears a piece of paper hands half to Billy They each bite
off strips for spitballs stocking up

With a Sumo stomp Weezer braces for Hicks’ next charge From
behind the desk a volley of suction darts flies past

SUZIE
Stop it Stop it

For just a moment quiet
SUZIE
We are in the fifth grade We should
be able to behave like grown ups for a
few

An eraser TAGS her leaving a blotch of chalk She seethes but
keeps her cool

SUZIE
All I’m saying is that if we just work
together we can

She’s hit by another eraser A beat

SUZIE
You are so dead

She picks up both erasers and whips them back The girls take
this as their cue to seek cover They end up on the far side of
the room away from the door

AT THE SINK

Weezer cups his hand and turns on the pressure shooting a spray
of water across the room

BEHIND THE CABINET

Girls SCREAM covering themselves Some start throwing books
from the shelf in self-defense

BEHIND THE TEACHERS DESK
Billy gets hit in the face by a book

WEEZER
One two three

Weezer leads a charge Billy doesn’t follow him his nose now
starting to bleed Joe stays behind as well a contented smirk

on his face Pencils and paperclips tumble off the desk

In SLOW MOTION Weezer and company set upon the girls streams
of Elmer’s glue hanging heavy in the air Glitter grenades
burst like fireworks covering everything with sparkles

The Cowlicked Kid launches a frisbee that ricochets once twice
before WHACKING the sprinkler head in the middle of the ceiling
A drip of water Another

And then a flood

An alarm RINGS as the rain begins At first everyone tries to
get out of the way but the spray is inescapable Suzie gets to
her feet soaked Billy stands up from behind the desk They
trade a look of horror and resignation

For a moment everyone stands where they are in the rain
paralyzed by impending doom

We PUSH IN on the sprinkler as it slows to a drip We are
now

INT CLASSROOM - LATER

The students stand in formation by the closets still wet and
dripping

WEEZER
(to Gelman low)
Do I got glitter on my tongue

We slowly REVERSE to see that the room is destroyed Smears of
paint soak into the carpet Wet construction paper dangles from
the bulletin boards

Along with the JANITOR Christine upends desks dumping out
water She shakes out a textbook but it comes apart in her
hands

The kids keep their eyes low in shame and terror as Christine
approaches All but Billy who has his head back to keep his
nose from bleeding Christine takes a look

CHRISTINE
Go down to the nurse’s office

BILLY
I think it’s almost

CHRISTINE
Now

There’s an edge to her voice that is best not questioned As
Billy leaves all the kids watch him Watch her
INT NURSE’S OFFICE - DAY

dripping

School Cook

BILLY
I thought you were the cook
COOK

Sit

Billy complies The Cook pokes his nose making sure nothing’s
broken He shoves cotton plugs up each nostril

COOK
So how many worms have you eaten
(off reaction)

anything if that’s what you’re worried
about

BILLY
(finally)
Six I have nine left

COOK
Fifteen worms Highest I ever heard
somebody going was twelve

BILLY
Other people have done it

COOK

BILLY
What happened to ‘em

COOK

Mostly they figured out how stupid it

was to eat worms

He hands Billy an ice pack

COOK

What do you get if you win
BILLY

Nothing
COOK

No bike No cash
Billy shakes his head

COOK

So youre doing it for honor That’s
good Only people who ever finished
finished for honor They had a code

BILLY
What’s a code

COOK
A code it’s likewell

You know the

difference between what’s right and

what’s wrong

BILLY
Sometimes

COOK

See a code helps you figure that out

It’s like a set of rules

When you get

confused you can just go back to your
code Me I started with twelve
things Most of them probably don’t

apply to you

Billy nods as he thinks it over
Heading for the door he turns

BILLY
What’s my code

COOK

It makes a lot of sense

That’s just it You have to find it

for yourself

MRS SAINT-CLAIRE

Christine has the opportunity to jump back in She passes

MRS SAINT-CLAIRE (CONT’D)

sunny days

With that she leaves After a beat Christine stifles a scream
chucking the eraser at the door She feels guilty but better

BILLY
I’m sorry about trashing the room
although I only did a little bit a
tiny bit really But I’m sorry

That’s it He’s done

CHRISTINE
On a bigger picture do you understand
that you should have come to get me

He nods

CHRISTINE
And are you apologizing for that too

BILLY
Why do I hafta apologize for something
I didn’t do

CHRISTINE
Didn’t do but should have done

You know they’re having some big
parents meeting tonight

BILLY
Yeah

TOM
It’s perfect While they’re at that
were gonna meet at 730 on the
playground for the last worm

Paying for his candybar Billy nods half-heartedly Gelman
makes an amazing find among the magazines

GELMAN
Spider Marine versus Swamp Rat
Limited edition

BILLY
That’s forty bucks

GELMAN
I have the money Least I’1l have it
tomorrow

He looks to Tom who shoots him a deadly look Billy looks to
Tom

TOM
Okay We didn’t want to tell you
because we thought it might jinx you
Sorta like how you made the bet with
Joe some of us made little side bets
of our own

BILLY
You bet on me

TOM
Mostly Some people bet against you

Billy is reeling

GELMAN
If you finish Joe owes me thirty and
Hicks owes me twenty

Billy looks to Hicks farther back at the newstand He tries to
hide

BILLY
(to Tom)
How much did you bet

TOM
Altogether Ninety for twenty
against
(off reaction)
I was just covering the spread

Weezer’s brain thaws popping back to consciousness He begins
slurping again

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

Katie is standing by the cabinets crying for no particular
reason

BILLY
Dad do you think if

Katie suddenly starts WAILING as only two year-olds can Mitch
picks her up but it doesn’t help He calls upstairs

MITCH
Honey we gotta go now or we’re going
to be late

He walks off with Katie trying to calm her Billy is left
alone in his quandary

INT GYMNASIUM - NIGHT
At the podium a SQUEAK

MRS SAINT-CLAIRE
If we could get started Everyone
please take a seat

A crowd of PARENTS mills about slowly coming to their chairs
Mitch and Christine are there along with Katie Overwhelmingly
frustrated Christine starts to get up to go for the podium but
Mitch holds her back

Mrs Saint-Claire is at a table with six SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS
She relies on her note-cards

MRS SAINT-CLAIRE
Parents friends distinguished members
of the school board I want to thank
you all for coming here tonight I’m
sure most of you are probably aware of
the difficulties this school has been
having over the past two weeks and are
probably concerned Lord knows I was
But I remind you we’re not here to
point fingers or to find fault
Instead of being negative we need to
be positive And I’m sure once we are
positive we’ll know what has to be
done

INT FOYER - NIGHT

Billy zips up his jacket The clock reads 720

INT COWLICKED KID’S HOUSE - NIGHT

While his SISTER makes out with SOME GUY on the couch the Kid
sneaks out

INT SAINT-CLAIRE HOUSE - NIGHT

Alan and Suzie leave at the same time but certainly not
together

EXT PLAYGROUND - NIGHT

An autumn wind sweeps through a lone elm swaying against the
night sky Swings dangle like pendulums

Softly at first we hear DRUMS Faces emerge from the darkness
at the edge of the playground Suzie and Alan Gretchen The
Cowlicked Kid walking his bike They are all gathering

As the drums grow LOUDER we see the source Hicks and Weezer
are banging on the playground slide working up a good beat

Gelman slowly turns the merry-go-round Billy sits at the dead
center blindfolded

As the kids gather we see the whole class has come to bear
witness Tom holds the worm container Joe stands alone

At Tom’s signal Gelman stops Billy removes his blindfold
Gets up woozy He starts walking toward the group As the
SLIDE-DRUMMING becomes thunderous we enter SLOW MOTION

Tom digs Big Charley out of the dirt Billy walks Gelman
leads a silent cheer of “Bil-EE Bil-EE” The Cowlicked Kid
smiles in anticipation

BILLY (VO)
In this strange and forbidding world
one creature walks alone

Suzie watches him her expression harder to read Billy walks
BILLY (VO)

He follows a compass only he can see
to a place he does not know

Mitch is walking right behind him talking into his ear

MITCH
Action Consequences Think about it

Billy blinks and Mitch vanishes Still walking he looks across
the crowd of CHEERING kids Christine is among them

CHRISTINE
Sometimes doing the right thing means
being a dork

He focusses only on Tom holding the worm a few steps away
But then Tom changes into the Cook

BILLY (VO)
What do you do when there’s two right
things to do

COOK
That’s the hardest part Deciding
what’s more important

Billy takes the worm from him All sound goes away We just
hear Billy’s BREATH his HEARTBEAT He holds the wriggling worm
in his hand looking across a sea of frozen faces Time has
stopped

ANOTHER VOICE
Hey Hey Kid

Billy looks down at his hand Big Charley is standing up
talking to him

BIG CHARLEY
Are you gonna eat me or what I been
waiting fifteen days and lemme tell
ya that’s a long time for a worm
Look at me What’d’I gotta live for
Nothin I live in dirt But this
This is my one chance at history baby
I got a name Me and Jimminy Cricket
Only bugs with names

(leaning closer)

Kid we got a common destiny I’m
pleadin’ with ya Eat me

BILLY
I can’t

Like that the spell is broken We’re out of Billyvision

TOM
What do you mean you can’t

BILLY
I can’t until I know my mom is okay
This is my fault and I have to fix it

He pockets the worm

GELMAN
Why

BILLY
Because I have a code

He starts toward the school alone The Cowlicked Kid is
shocked and crushed

GELMAN
What the hell is a code

Only Suzie understands

INT GYMNASIUM - NIGHT
Pulling out a file Mrs Saint-Claire continues her prosecution

MRS SAINT-CLAIRE
So far I’ve focussed on professional
issues her lackluster discipline
poor communication skills gross
irresponsiblity

One of the board members a NEBBISHY GUY is shaking his pen to
get it to write Mrs Saint-Claire hands him hers

MRS SAINT-CLAIRE
(leaning close)
Poor communication gross
irresponsiblity

He writes that down She smiles Christine rolls her eyes

MRS SAINT-CLAIRE
But to really understand the problem
we need to look at the issue of
personal character What kind of
person is Christine Forrester What
kind of mother is she

Christine can’t take any more She stands

CHRISTINE
Stop

MRS SAINT-CLAIRE
What kind of mother allows her son to
eat worms

CHRISTINE
You can question my credentials as
teacher or a principal but don’t you
ever question my ability to be a
mother

Mrs Saint-Claire smiles to herself There’s a dead space a
silence filled with SQUEAKING chairs and nervous RUSTLING An
ECHO as the gymnasium doors open

It’s Billy He’s spooked by how many people there are but
starts to cross to the podium

MRS SAINT-CLAIRE
The prodigal son returns

CHRISTINE
Billy what are you doing here

BILLY
Don’t worry I got it all figured out

Mitch covers his eyes At the podium he motions for Mrs Saint-
Claire to step aside With a “would-you-look-at-this” she
does

BILLY
My name is Billy Forrester and I gotta
explain This whole thing started
fifteen days ago because I didn’t want
everyone to think I was a dork when
really I was a dork for caring what
everyone thought Anyway I made this
bet to eat fifteen worms in fifteen
days She didn’t know anything about
it And if you think you know
everything your kids do then you’re
just stupid

Not exactly winning over the crowd

BILLY
I guess my point

All heads turn as the DOORS open again It’s Suzie Mrs Saint-
Claire is alarmed

Behind Suzie it’s Tom And Weezer Hicks Gelman -- the whole
class comes in Parents start BUZZING

BILLY

I guess my point is this is a kid thing
and you’re trying to treat it like it’s
a grown up thing and it’s not I mean
we were the ones who screwed up the
classroom and Suzie and I were the
ones who got lost So if you’re gonna
blame somebody you gotta blame us
Blame me My mom taught me to take
responsibility for my actions and
that’s what I’m gonna do

He pulls Big Charley out of his pocket sets it down The worm
wriggles around on the table

BILLY
This is the fifteenth worm And as
much junk as I went through to eat the
first fourteen I’d give it all up for
her She’s my mom and I love her
But she’s also a damn good principal
and youd be stupid to get rid of her
just because her kid eats worms

TOM
Damn right

WEEZER
Woo-hoo

BILLY

Oh That’s it

Angle on Christine As bad as this is she can’t help but be a
little proud She waves Billy over

MRS SAINT-CLAIRE
Well

CHRISTINE
(low)
Billy I really appreciate what you’re
trying to do But you don’t have to
give up the bet for me

BILLY
I want to

ANGLE ON Mrs Saint-Claire basking in the glory of her victory
She’s about to speak when Coach McGuire stands up

COACH MCGUIRE
I’d just like to say I love my kid
And one day I hope he learns what
Billy Forrester did because let me
tell you As a parent I could never
be prouder

CONSTABLE JACKSON
You said it

WOMAN IN THE AUDIENCE
Half the time I don’t know what my
kids are up to You just hope they
have a sense of what’s right and what’s
wrong

MAN IN AUDIENCE
(pointing to Christine)
If you could help me teach my kids
that I would double your salary

TOM’S GRANDMOTHER
All in favor of seeing this kid eat his
worm

Hands go up in the audience a few at first then more And
more It’s almost unanimous The kids CHEER Joe slinks back
against the wall

Mrs Saint-Claire stares in disbelief Weezer starts a low
cheer “Bill-EE Bill-EE”

BILLY
(to his parents)
Can I

Mitch and Christine nod Billy walks back to the front

He takes Big Charley tosses it up in the air Catches it in
his mouth swallowing him whole The kids CHEER wildly
swarming the podium Weezer is in tears Hicks pats him on the
back

GELMAN
I wish I had a code

COUNCILMEMBER
Meeting adjourned

He BANGS the gavel Gretchen hugs Christine from behind The
Cowlicked Kid brushes past Joe They lock stares

COWLICKED KID
See you at the bike racks

The crowd parts to reveal Suzie Billy offers her a hand
BILLY
Thanks man
She takes his hand then jerks him in for a big kiss right on
the lips The boys are shocked

SUZIE
Way to go Billy Forrester

Billy stares straight ahead dumbfounded and horrified Mitch
nudges Christine -- that’s my kid
