The Only Living Boy In New York

EXT THE ISLAND OF MANHATTANOPENING TITLES — DAY

Fly over the East River until the privileged cement
canyons of the Upper East Side roll by now the green of
Central Park to the Las Vegas of Times Square and the

charm of Chelsea

As the grid gives way to the thin doglegs of the West
Village over the stark lofts of Tribeca to Libeskins
work in progress Phoenix readying to rise

Around the thumbnail of the Financial District to the
immigrant-cum-hipster miasma of the Lower East Side over
the multicolored fire escapes of The East Village

And land on

UNION SQUARE

amongst the activity the cars the throngs of people
find

THOMAS WEBB

Early-twenties a blank canvas of a boy with perfect teeth
Dirty-washed jeans and the famous Lennon New York T

Thomas stands still in the middle of Union Square with the
people around him rushing from one tiny piece of their life
to the next Hes collecting himself Stealing a moment
As Thomas descends into the subway

INT UNION SQUARE STATION — DAY

The uptown 456 platform Waiting for his train Thomas
looks down the track A man in a WOOL HAT turns to him

WOOL HAT
Its coming

Thomas breaks his gaze regards the man

THOMAS
Yes

WOOL HAT
Know how I knew

( )

THOMAS
Excuse me
WOOL HAT
The train How I knew it was
coming Would you like to know

Thomas shrugs A dramatic beat then

WOOL HAT (CONTD)
Mice

THOMAS
Mice

In proud confirmation

WOOL HAT
Mice

INT THE UPTOWN NO5 SUBWAY — DAY

Thomas leans against the pole Hes lost in the reverie of
his moving reflection until something catches his eye

A SUBWAY AD
for an exhibit at the met It shows a statue
RODINS HAND OF GOD

A large white marble hand that rises up from the earth
The hand holds a man and a woman in its grasp

As Thomas holds on the ad
INT THE REGGIE SANDERS GALLERY — DAY
A small art gallery in the East Village
MIMI

Shes into him But hes not into

her
MIMI PASTORI
wears a double dyed pink wife-beater that stops just short of
her bumper sticker the Chinese symbol of balance She
owns a temple of a body built of feminine mesa-morph and

displays small diamond stud in her nose

All of Mimis attempts to hide her beauty fail miserably

( )

As Mimi points up toward the painting shes looking at

MIMI
Her love for him is so transparent
its embarrassing

Thomas stands at her side They admire the painting

We now see that they are looking at a Calderesque abstract
painting featuring only a black circle and a purple triangle
at opposite ends Mimis pointing to the triangle

MIMI (CONTD)
And look at how indifferent he is
about it Its obvious hes not
going to turn

And Mimi always wears this thing that makes her incredibly
sexy its called an education

THOMAS
They never turn

As she pulls away

MIMI
Yes its sad Shes all alone
There are no more shapes in the
painting

They fall into a slow gallery pace

THOMAS
Will you come with me

MIMI
No Thomas I wouldnt go to
another one of your mothers dinner
parties for all the money in that
room

THOMAS
You dont care about money

MIMI
But I care about my sanity

They walk in silence Admiring the art work
MIMI (CONTD)

Just dont go if it bothers you
that much

( )

THOMAS
I have to My mother isnt stable
Throwing dinner parties is how she
medicates

MIMI
What about the Lithium and Xanax
not to mention the nicotine and
Shiraz

Thomas thinks about it for a beat then

THOMAS
Semantics

EXT TOMPKINS SQUARE PARK — DAY
They walk through the park Its a brilliant fall day

MIMI
Thomas I have to tell you
something I might be going to
Zagreb

THOMAS
Where

MIMI
Its the largest city in Croatia
Helmut Graph is running a workshop
and I can transfer the credits back
to NYU

Thomas puts on a plastic smile Tries to be happy for her

THOMAS
Thats

And immediately fails

THOMAS (CONTD)
terrible

MIMI
Why Why is that terrible

THOMAS
Because youre the only thing in my
life Im settled on How long is
the program

( )

Mimi stops

MIMI
Six months Look I dont even
know if Helmut will have me hes
fucking brilliant He doesnt
accept just anybody

faces him

MIMI (CONTD)
Thomas just what do you think is
happening here You and I What
do you think this is

THOMAS
I think I August eighth I
think August eighth was real

MIMI
It was amazing Thomas but it was
just one night We were both on
ecstasy I thought I was a pirate
and I was vulnerable because Nick
left and it was just one night

THOMAS
Well Im crazy about you

MIMI
And Im crazy about you But--

THOMAS
Dont say as a friend

He pulled the words right out of her mouth

MIMI
Why not Thomas Why is that so
bad

THOMAS

Because pretty girls like to
recruit their rejections and call
them friends

Mimi considers arguing but defers to sigh in defeat

MIMI
Yeah Im pretty sure ugly girls do
it too

Mimi puts on a mock frown Then

( )

MIMI (CONTD)
You know one of the first concepts
children learn Thomas Justice
fairness They comprehend it at
like two Their favorite refrain
Not fair

As she pierces into him with her blue eyes
MIMI (CONTD)
Its funny -- we learn justice so
young but it takes us a lifetime to
comprehend injustice

And she kisses him on the forehead

MIMI (CONTD)
We dont turn Sweetie

INT 99 ORCHARD STREET — NIGHT

Thomas heads into the Lower East Side tenement grabs his

mail and stops to sift through it

Aman in his fifties stands in the small foyer with him
This man just stands there regarding Thomas all the while

MAN
Anything worth opening

Thomas looks with a smile

THOMAS
Just bills and junk

Thomas returns to his mail but the man doesnt stop staring

at him Hes disheveled but not vagrant more of a

INT THOMAS APARTMENT — NIGHT

Lower East Side typical Thomas lays on his mattress and
stares at the ceiling Frustrated Eyes wide open

THOMAS
(to the ceiling)
How is it so obvious

EXT 99 ORCHARD STREETHALLWAY — NIGHT
Thomas knocks on 3C WF answers the door

THOMAS
The way she bites her lip when
shes nervous The way her
incredibly witty remarks have the
ability to be optimistic and
cynical at the same time The way
she looks at me when I say
something stupid and the way she
looks at me when I dont Do you

( )

WF
No I get it
THOMAS

( )

THOMAS

THOMAS
Right So Nick goes on tour

night together on August eighth

And Thomas sighs in wistful defeat

THOMAS (CONTD)
Then it all goes platonic

WF
How old is Mimi Thomas

THOMAS
Twenty-two She just turned twenty-
two

WF thinks about it for a moment then leans forward
Thomas listens as if its God telling him the situation

WF
Mimis young Thomas Shes at an
age where defense mechanisms are
very strong Despite her outer
veneer shes ruled by fear You
just need to make her afraid of
something more than being with you

THOMAS
Which is

WF
Not being with you

Thomas sips his wine mulls it over

THOMAS
How am I supposed to do that

( )
ll

WF
Let life take over Find a window
Then pounce

Thomas considers it thinks it through

THOMAS
Thats your sage neighborly advice
I want my money back

WF
Oh youre not giving life enough
credit Thomas The unpredictable
forces of humanity

THOMAS
My life is not unpredictable Its
conventional And its boring

WF stands and stretches Says in a tired sigh

WF
Life is as much of a dream as it is
a nightmare as random as it is
deliberate as funny as it is
tragic and yours is no
exception Thomas

Thomas considers WF

THOMAS
Who are you
WF
I told you -- Im WF Gerald

As Thomas simply regards this strange man

EXT RIVERSIDE DRIVE BROWNSTONE — NIGHT

Looks like an old castle Recently renovated the expansive
four story brownstone sits across from Riverside Park as it
hugs the corner of 83rd street

INT THE WEBB BROWNSTONE — NIGHT

A dinner party in full swing Thomas sits at the table with
around ten other NEW YORKERS all well heeled

A heated argument is taking place between GEORGE an
investment banker and a film critic named DAVID

( )

GEORGE
Tammany Hall worked

DAVID
Worked at lining pockets

Note Thomas mother JUDITH WEBB early 50s intellectually
attractive as opposed to the reconstructed uptown statues
shes friends with But Judiths always nervous seems on

the verge of a breakdown precisely because she is

GEORGE
And youre going to claim Robert
Moses was clean

Note Thomas father NATHAN WEBB 50s Has that indefinable
aura of success to him Very good looking When a woman
claims shes into older men shes referring to Nathan

BARBARA an art dealer chimes in

BARBARA
Did anybody read Jeffrey Tobins
article about how New York should
secede from the rest of the
country

GEORGE
(back at David)
Robert Moses wanted to turn this
city into Los Angeles

BARBARA
It was very clever Calvin Klein
would design the flag Giuliani

would be on the money

ANNA a top magazine editor and a Brit picks it up

ANNA
I read an brilliant book on the
history of great Mayors

Nathan speaks up and the table immediately listens

NATHAN
Speaking of books Anna we just
commissioned Neil Strauss to do a
bio on Jenna Jameson

BARBARA
Jameson The pharmacy heiress

( )

NATHAN
No shes a porn star Barb

DAVID
And people really care about that

NATHAN
Thats all they care about Our
mandate is simple at Kenta bios of
any haircut under forty as long as
theyre still with-in their fifteen
minutes self help political
rants and weight loss

With a British sigh

ANNA
Fiction is dead Its quite sad
NATHAN
Its not sad Anna Its
economics
GEORGE

Im sorry Nathan but I disagree
Dont you think youre dummying
down America

NATHAN
America was dummied down years ago
The jobs finished George Turn
on a TV go to Times Square have a
conversation with a fifteen year
old Fiction may be dead but
commerce is not

Anna tisks

ANNA
And once a writer so cynical
Nathan Webb

Nathan shrugs it off Judith grabs her husbands hand

JUDITH
I know Anna I want him to sell
the company Launch some sort of
magazine that could give exposure
to these gifted young writers out
there He says he doesnt want to
sell false hope

( )

Nathan kisses Judith

NATHAN
Her idealism Thats why I married
her

Thomas sheepishly smiles Admiring his parents love

NATHAN (CONTD)
Its simple if I had continued
with my writing career wed all be
having this conversation in a two
bedroom in Queens and none of you
would be here

DAVID
But Nathan youre a much better
publisher than you ever were a
writer

Nathan shrugs off Davids remark then looks over to his son
NATHAN
Look if Thomas were to come to me
with the desire to become a writer
Id talk him out of it

Now the table is looking at Thomas

BARBARA
How is the restaurant business
Thomas

THOMAS

I dont work for Union Square
Hospitality anymore

Nathan announces to the table while glaring at Thomas
NATHAN
He lives on the Lower East Side
without any direction The only
thing missing is a marijuana habit

Seems like a joke but both Thomas and Nathan know that
was Dad serving a dig So Thomas returns

THOMAS
But Im working on that

They all laugh Except for Nathan

INT KITCHEN — NIGHT

Thomas leans against the granite island Judith smokes a
cigarette Shed be doing the dishes but she has HELP so
she simply watches them do it

JUDITH
Our Warhols may not be Warhols
Well theyre Warhols rest
assured but this damn
authentication committee has been
screwing everyone over to raise the
prices of their own pieces

THOMAS
They1l be authenticated Mom
Dont worry

Shes perpetually frantic seamlessly shuffling from one
topic to another Its how she fits into her skin

JUDITH
Dont pay any attention to your
father He thinks if he can
embarrass you in front of our
friends itll motivate you

THOMAS
Its fine Mom

Judith takes her sons hand

JUDITH
You take your time you werent
happy working for Danny Meyer
Andy Warhol personally himself gave
us one of the pieces Your father
is too hard on you Its not like
he didnt take his time

THOMAS
Mom its fine

JUDITH
He didnt build the publishing
house up until after years of
poverty and failure -- he was going
to be the next Salinger

She takes a long reflective benzodiazapine-enduced moment
then looks up almost crying

( )

JUDITH (CONTD)
I dont know what Id do without
that man Hes my vein Thomas

Thomas just stands there -- knows better than to reward his
mothers drama with affection

They hold the look for an extra long moment until

THOMAS

MIMI
I dont know Im still waiting
for an E-mail from Helmut

As she skims over her menu

MIMI (CONTD)
Everybody is saying that Croatia is
the new Prague but its better than
that its more like the old
Paris

Thomas simply regards her as she bites her lip Her every
nuance slays him He gets lost in her sometimes has to snap
himself back As he does

THOMAS
This man moved in across the hall
from me I dont know what he does
or who he is But he seems
familiar to me Hes my new
friend

MIMI
Um-hm

THOMAS
He asked about you

Mimi looks up from her menu

MIMI
About me He knows me

Thomas sees something at the door that catches his eye

THOMAS

Thomas lies on the futon Hes in a state
THOMAS
Do you have any idea what this is

Mimi sits down on the futon She grabs his hand
MIMI
Thomas this doesnt mean your

Thomas just blankly looks at her

( )

MIMI (CONTD)

She opens her mouth but he holds up his hand

THOMAS (CONTD)
Dont answer that Not now

She swallows it back He throws his head into his hands

THOMAS (CONTD)
Im going to be sick

And Mimi lifts Thomas head slowly looks into his eyes and
doesnt say anything

A long silence and an uncomfortable silence and their
mouths are so close and its an uncomfortable silence a
pregnant moment and shes so pretty and he goes in

Kisses her

She doesnt do a thing Doesnt kiss back doesnt pull
away just waits till hes finished kissing before she talks

MIMI
Dont do this

And hes up on his feet
THOMAS

Why not Am I that disgusting to
you

( )

MIMI
Of course not

THOMAS
Youre young and your defense
mechanisms are strong But I think

As she averts his glare

MIMI
Thomas I think youre confused
right now

THOMAS
No Mimi Im angry right now
Did you see that woman Did you

WF
Are you going to confront him

THOMAS

WF resumes his attention to the project on his desk
Thomas looks around the barren apartment

( )

THOMAS (CONTD)
Why dont you furnish this place

As WF finally finishes his project and holds it
pride a tightly rolled joint
WF

Because I live in Brooklyn

WF hands Thomas the joint Thomas lights it
Churning the infidelity as he inhales

THOMAS
Maybe hes been faithful all these
years maybe she came on to him
Ive seen her it would be nearly
impossible to turn her down Maybe
this is an isolated incident

Thomas exhales passes the joint to WF

WF
Thomas What do you want

THOMAS

when they want to talk to someone more important

MIMI

MIMI (CONTD)
Thomas

Hes lost in the lock of Johannas gaze

MIMI (CONTD)
Thomas

Thomas blankly nods Looking at Johanna all the while
INT METROPOLITAN MUSEUM — SAME

shes not my girlfriend just a

good friend

JOHANNA
Oh you shouldnt let her do that

THOMAS
Hes thirty years older than you

stupid

JOHANNA

You are stupid Thomas And you
dont understand how the world
works

(and then)
And hes not a billionaire anymore
because Nancy got half of
everything

THOMAS
It doesnt really matter

JOHANNA
No it doesnt
(then)
You look nice

He turns to her

THOMAS
What

JOHANNA
In a tux You look very nice
Youre not conventionally good
looking like your father but you
have a certain cerebral appeal that
youre going to grow into

Thomas tries to shrug off the compliment

( )

JOHANNA (CONTD)
And I dont really think youre
stupid just confused

Thomas takes a big swig of his drink Glares at her
THOMAS
Irwins probably looking for you
Im sure he paid for the whole
night

Johanna grabs him by the arm hard

JOHANNA
Come here

She pulls him off to the side away from everyone
Right in front of a statue

JOHANNA (CONTD)

First of all hooker comments
Have you really resorted to hooker
comments

Thomas looks down to his feet

JOHANNA (CONTD)
Second of all Irwin divorced Nancy
because hes gay He loves men
In fact he loves one man in
particular A man named Billy
Arnaldi who happens to be an
incredible interior decorator and
one of my closest friends

Shes furious Keeps going
JOHANNA (CONTD)

Now Irwin doesnt want to come out

and thats his prerogative so I

come to events like this with him

Im not a glorified hooker hes

not my sugar daddy -- Im a beard
Thomas looks up to see the statue facing him is

RODINS HAND OF GOD

The real deal In the marble In all its glory

( )

JOHANNA
You dont know how the world works
Youre an innocent -- a child

Okay We live in shades of gray --
not black and white Not
everything is what it seems -- not
everything you read is true --
there is no fuckin Santa Claus

Thomas is silent Embarrassed Then

THOMAS
For real

JOHANNA
For real

THOMAS
Hes gay

JOHANNA
Belle and Sebastian

And Thomas simply stares at Rodins masterpiece
JOHANNA (CONTD)
And you werent looking out for

your father -- you were jealous

THOMAS
I wasnt jealous

Thomas cant look at her His eyes pasted on the statue

JOHANNA
Its okay Thomas
THOMAS
I dont feel well I drank too

much
She walks behind him faces the statue as well Like theyre
at the same exhibit in deep in appreciation of the same
piece but dont know each other

JOHANNA
You dont have to be jealous

As she lightly brushes his hair from the back of his neck

JOHANNA (CONTD)
And you can stop

( )

THOMAS
Stop what
She steps forward Whispers into his ear

JOHANNA
Trying to

And she lightly kisses the back of his neck A baby kiss

JOHANNA (CONTD)
- make love to me Thomas

Thomas gaze is pasted onto the statue That giant white
marbled hand jutting out from the Earth and holding those two
naked people Protecting them Or about to squeeze

She repeats her last line Only now its its own sentence

JOHANNA (CONTD)
Make love to me Thomas

AND THOMAS WEBB

Staring straight ahead Close on wide eyed A handful of
shock mixed with a pinch of fear As he fights down a
swallow Says nothing Closer still a bead of sweat

rolls down the side of his face

Hold on his deer-in-the-headlight expression then pull back
to be in

JOHANNAS LOFT

Spacious And impeccably decorated Thomas stands still
with that same expression

Johanna lays down two glasses of red wine on the table sits
on the couch

JOHANNA
Wont you join me

THOMAS
This is wrong

She slowly moves from the couch to him

JOHANNA
There is no right or wrong

She touches his lips with hers Not a kiss a touch

( )

JOHANNA (CONTD)
There is only is This is a good
is Thomas

She kisses his neck

JOHANNA (CONTD)
Theres this story about a monk who
wanted to know what pure truth was
So he climbed this really big
mountain and found the head grand
pooh-bah monk who lived there

Takes his hand slowly glides it from her face to her neck
JOHANNA (CONTD)
Now nobody had made it this far
before Thomas so this was a big
deal And he asked the head monk
what was pure truth And do you
know what the head monk said
He has to swallow to fight out the simple word

THOMAS
No

JOHANNA
So it has come to this

As she glides his hand down the neckline of her dress
JOHANNA (CONTD)
No judgment No right or wrong

Pure truth

Johanna places Thomas hand onto her breast as he looks her
tightly in the eyes

JOHANNA (CONTD)
So it has come to this

Then suddenly he RIPS her dress open throws her back
against the couch She lets out a surprised moan as he takes
her by the back of neck

And he kisses her

Hard wet not clean

And he ravages her

AND THOMAS WEBB

naked on top sweating thrusting forward out of breath
another thrust

All the cruel cock teases all the sexless friendzones all
the nice-guy last place finishes all of it Redeemed ina
moment This moment

And Thomas Webb closes his eyes and climaxes
INT JOHANNAS LOFTBEDROOM — MORNING
Thomas opens his eyes Speaks

THOMAS
I have to go

Johanna tussles awake Places her head on his chest

JOHANNA
Why do you have to go

THOMAS
I have to go to a career counselor
My father set up the appointment

JOHANNA
Why dont you just go into
journalism You ran the High
School newspaper

THOMAS
It doesnt interest me anymore
Howd you know that

JOHANNA
Go into advertising you won that
award in college

THOMAS
They don’t let you work creatively
until after like five years -- how

do you know all this about me
JOHANNA

You father has all your awards in

his office

She goes on to list them by rote

( )

JOHANNA (CONTD)
Yearbook committee scored 760 on
your verbal SATS President of the
debate club arts editor of the
school newspaper second singles on
the college tennis team its all
very impressive Trust me a girl
takes notice

Thomas lifts her head off his stomach brings it back for a
forceful kiss then

THOMAS
Heres something you dont know
Heres something nobody knows
I wanted to write

JOHANNA
Really

She takes his head onto her chest Traces his hair line

THOMAS
I wrote these stupid stories in
High school they werent really
stories they were more like
letters

JOHANNA
Letters

THOMAS
But not to people To concepts
Like Dear Death I know I cant
avoid you but I dont want to fear
you

As her fingers trace his eyebrows

JOHANNA
You would personify abstractions
then write letters to them

THOMAS
Yes But I tried to make the
substance of the letters universal
you know what we all feel

JOHANNA
Thats cool

( )

THOMAS
I wrote over thirty of those
letters I thought they could make
a book

JOHANNA
I think so Very Mitch Albom Jack
Canfield point of purchase

THOMAS
Sophomore year I cleaned them up
and showed them to my father

JOHANNA
And what did Nathan say

THOMAS
Serviceable

JOHANNA
Ouch

Thomas stares at the ceiling Her fingers trace his ears
his chin his mouth

THOMAS
That was the exact word Nothing
special he said Serviceable
He seemed very angry after reading
them You have to understand hes
very bitter he never made it as a
writer

She leans over and kisses him
JOHANNA
Well I love the idea Id like to
read them right away

He doesnt kiss back Just vacantly stares at the ceiling

THOMAS
I threw them out

She lays back down Stares at the same ceiling

JOHANNA
Thats so sad Thats so

She searches for the right word And finds it

( )

JOHANNA (CONTD)
-- lonely
INT THOMAS APARTMENT — DAY

WF sits at Thomas desk finishes reading something on
printed paper then places it on top of a stack of others

WF
Its excellent

THOMAS
Really

WF
I especially liked the one you
wrote to disconnection it rang

very true for me

THOMAS
Youre only the second person I
ever let read them

WF
And what was the word your father
used

THOMAS
Serviceable

WF
They are so much more than that
Thomas Theyre introspective and
inspired and collective You could
do a whole series

THOMAS
Johanna wanted to read them but I
could never

It trails off Then
WF
Right Johanna
(and then)
Do you feel guilty

THOMAS
I think I love her

( )

WF
Love is hard to determine Thomas
People think theyre in love when
its often something completely
different Infatuation the
righting of childhood wrongs
companionship

A beat of silence until

WF (CONTD)
But Ive found a sure way to know

THOMAS
A litmus test

WF
Right My litmus test of love

But thats it WF stops talking Doesnt want to give
more information But he kinda does and its obvious

So Thomas waits Doesnt say anything WF capitulates

WF (CONTD)
Okay there was a woman I knew
She was taken by someone else and
he was a very close friend of mine
I always had a profound connection
with this woman but she was his
girl I felt I loved her but I
didnt know

Thomas All ears

WF (CONTD)
I needed to find out But if I did
love her then I would leave I
would recede from my friends lives
and essentially disappear

THOMAS
That seems so drastic

WF
I was younger then Not much older
than you are now At that age the

world is cut and dry you should
know that Thats how your world
is now

Thomas thinks about it then answers an earlier question

( )

THOMAS
But I dont feel guilty Thats
not cut or dry
WF

INT 99 ORCHARDHALLWAY — DAY

Thomas knocks WFs door No answer He knocks a final
time then heads back down the hall and passes the hall window
with the fire escape for a view And he stops

As Thomas ponders the fire escape

INT WFS APARTMENT — DAY

Empty The fire escape covers the South window

As Thomas comes into view and works the old window Its not
locked just paint-stuck Thomas wedges his hand under and
forces it up

As Thomas gains entry and looks around He heads into the
BEDROOM

No bed No dresser Just a desk and chair An ashtray

filled with cigar butts and roaches Open bottles of liquor
A small radio against the wall

( )

A manual typewriter sits on the desk with a few hundred
sheets of paper already written on next to it A manuscript

Thomas goes to the desk and turns over the manuscript to see
the title page

THOMAS
I didnt read your new manuscript
I wouldnt do that without your
permission

WF

the night air and heads back in As he goes

WF
Yes

MIMI
Do you have a date Thomas Webb

naked flushed determined on top Lurching forward and
upward Clutching the sheets tightly as she thrusts once
more And now shes satisfied

She lies her head down on Thomas chest

THOMAS
You lied to me

JOHANNA

THOMAS

Irwin Rosenthal isnt gay

JOHANNA
Who told you that

THOMAS
I asked a few old friends

As Johanna kisses his chest lightly

JOHANNA
Thats what he wants people to

THOMAS

You obviously dont care about

She leans up and stares at him incredulously

( )

JOHANNA
What the fuck You want to know
about my childhood I grew up in

experience after another

She lies back down They lay in silence until finally

JOHANNA (CONTD)
Fifteen

More silence

THOMAS
Why do you sleep with me

JOHANNA
Because I like you

THOMAS
What do you like about me

She thinks about it for a beat

JOHANNA
Your innocence

THOMAS
Were you ever innocent

JOHANNA
I forgot
THOMAS
No you didnt Tell me tell me

about when you were innocent

JOHANNA
Why Thomas

THOMAS
Because I like the idea of it

Care about you

They lie in silence Until

THOMAS (CONTD)
Do you Do you care about me

JOHANNA
I dont care about anyone Thomas

They both look up to the ceiling until

THOMAS
I wish I knew you then When you
were innocent

And this resonates with her Makes her angry
As she gets up covers herself with the sheet

JOHANNA
See Thomas thats the problem with
men You all want to fall in love
with Elaine Robinson
(and then)
-- but you just end up fucking her
mother

EXT AVE A — NIGHT

WF and Thomas enjoy a brisk night stroll through the dodgy-
cum-hipster streets of Alphabet City

WF
Its a reference from The
Graduate

THOMAS
I dont understand her Why isnt
she softer

WF

Thomas people are not always clean
and happy People are layered and
wounded and fragile

THOMAS

Do you think Johanna is any of
those

( )

WF
I quite sure shes all of those

Thomas just stares at WF for a long beat then

THOMAS
Your litmus test

WF stops

WF
Yes I didnt finish My litmus
test of love

WF lights up a cigar Resumes his earlier reminiscence

WF (CONTD)
If I knew for sure that I was in
love with Karen then I would
disconnect her and Benny from my
life The thing is I had no
idea if I really loved her or not

WF starts walking again Thomas at his side

WF (CONTD)
It happened by accident actually
You know the fountain in Washington
Square Park

Thomas does WF remembers fondly

WF (CONTD)
It was a very clear night with the
kind full moon you could read by
We stopped at that fountain There
were a few people milling about but
it was basically ours And I asked
her to dance

THOMAS
To dance

WF
Yes There was no music but we
danced there And it came to me
It was so clear I loved her

THOMAS

So your litmus test requires a
visit to Washington Square Park

( )

WF
By a bright moon yes

They walk in silence Thomas digesting it Then

THOMAS
And Karen

WF
That was the last night I ever
talked to her

THOMAS
How long ago was this

WF
Eighteen days

Thomas stops looks at him

WF (CONTD)
- four months and twenty two
years

INT THE WEBB RIVERSIDE DRIVE BROWNSTONE — NIGHT

constituents he was a fall guy

DAVID

Thomas looks across the table to where his father sits
Nathan looks distracted Impatiently playing with his food

NATHAN

Everybody quiets and looks over to Nathan

NATHAN (CONTD)
This dinner party has been recycled
a thousand times over Doesnt

Nathan stands Circles the table

NATHAN (CONTD)
George and Davids perpetual
argument over Boss Tweed versus
Robert Moses Barbaras constant
references to the current New

or watched whatever was hawked on
Charlie Rose the night before

Judith stands puts a comforting hand on Nathans arm

JUDITH

And to ease the pain we eat
together and talk about things that
we think are important

JUDITH
You need to lay down

( )

NATHAN
No I need to get out of here

Nathan announces to the group of shocked party guests

NATHAN (CONTD)

up at Starbucks

JUDITH
Well sometimes a big place is even
worse
Judith shakily lights another cigarette off her last
JUDITH (CONTD)

THOMAS

WF
You and your father are suffering

WF
Because thats what I do I write

and professions

THOMAS
But why me

WF
Because your story interests me
Look I got the apartment to get
out of the house and write this

Thomas looks back over to WF

At the top of Rockefeller Plaza The view is incredible

( )

Mimi and Thomas step out of the elevator into the swinging

poignant philosophical debates occupy the same table as
superficial book deals

fabulous A quiet jazz band provides the music

Judith and Nathan hold court with some of the partygoers
Thomas stops and looks at them Mimi at his side

As Mimi simply shrugs
AND JOHANNA

that line 5th avenue

( )

Somebody now stands at her side

WF
I have looked down upon the city
from high windows It is then that
the great buildings lose reality
and take on magical powers
Squares and squares of flame set
and cut into the ether Heres our
poetry for we have pulled down
the stars to our will

JOHANNA

This conversation is growing

strange

His piercing eyes Even tone Dead serious

WF
I know youre having your fun
Hes young and hes easy But
youll have me to deal with if he
scars

( )

Johannas face forms a plastic smile She speaks through it
JOHANNA
I dont like strange conversations
so Im going to walk away now

Johanna slowly walks away from WF who watches her every
graceful step

INT THE RAINBOW ROOM — LATER
Mimi talks with a FEMALE AUTHOR she admires as Thomas takes
in the whole party Mimi grabs him into a hug and kisses him
on the lips A quick one It catches him off guard
MIMI

AND THOMAS

admiring her youthful giddiness Drinking in its
intoxication As she takes him by the hand

MIMI
Dance with me Thomas Webb

THOMAS
Nobodys dancing

She leads him in front of the band

MIMI
I know

And they dance to a slow number Swaying back and forth in
good cadence with each other She whispers into his ear

MIMI (CONTD)
How long have you wanted me

THOMAS
Since the moment you recommended
Taps At Reveille

MIMI
That was the day we met

Thomas slowly confirms this Then

THOMAS
Are you going to Croatia

( )

MIMI
Do you want me to stay

She stops dancing

MIMI (CONTD)

And she kisses him This time its a longer one

MIMI (CONTD)
If you want me to

Thomas looks to Mimi but over her shoulder standing
alone staring right at them Johanna

THOMAS (CONTD)
What happened to you Somewhere in
your life you I dont know

It trails off Until

JOHANNA
Yes Thomas

( )

THOMAS
Inhuman

JOHANNA
Maybe I didnt lose my way -- maybe
I had it taken from me

THOMAS
You were abused

She looks away and slowly nods

THOMAS (CONTD)
Im sorry

And she cracks into a smile And laughs

THOMAS (CONTD)
Is something funny

JOHANNA
Yes You Thomas Your clichéd
world Your black and white
existence Your seat in the first
row of psychology one-o-one and
your hand raised so excitedly

THOMAS
You werent abused

JOHANNA
No Thomas But Ive been
overcharged before so maybe thats
why I don’t wear white

He glares at her Hurt

THOMAS
Fuck you
JOHANNA
I am who I am
He moves toward her -- determined
THOMAS

I want you out of our lives I
thought I loved you but you cant
be loved
(and then)
(MORE )

( ) THOMAS (CONTD)

Youre sick and you lie and you
seduce and God made a mistake when
he made you beautiful

JOHANNA
Are you finished

He takes a breath thinks about it then

THOMAS
Yes

JOHANNA
Im sorry you feel that way

THOMAS
Well I do

As Johanna lets out a superficial sigh

JOHANNA
Well you surely wont be the first
little boy who hates his

Thomas stands in shock

JOHANNA (CONTD)

JOHANNA (CONTD)
I can be loved

THOMAS
What do you think is going to
happen That you guys are going to

JOHANNA
No
Johanna turns to go but Thomas grabs her by the arm turns

Thomas loudly exclaims

THOMAS
Its about to squeeze them

TOUR GUIDE

Trains coming

Just then he looks down the tunnel to see the headlights

INT THE RED LION — NIGHT

notice the man painted with TATOOS staring

This man may want to kill him

WF
Because it wouldnt be fair

To Karen and Benny

Thomas slides over the picture of him winning the tennis
match WF looks down at the picture with no expression

THOMAS (CONTD)
Tell me about The Only Living Boy
In New York

WF nods in an order for another round

WF
Its about three people Two
artists and a beautiful woman One
of the artists has talent and the
other doesnt No matter how hard
he tries no matter how badly he
wants it he just wasnt kissed
by God in that way

THOMAS
But he has the girl

WF
Yes theyre married and they plan
to start a family only they have

a little problem
As the bartender places down the drinks
THOMAS
Hes infertile and they ask their
talented friend for help

WF
Youve a knack for story Thomas

And Thomas pierces the look right at WF

THOMAS
I get it from my father

WF lets it hang until

( )

WF takes

After WF

WF
Well the story takes place in the
seventies and they dont use
invetro fertilization in those
days They use a cheap bottle of
Cabernet and a Van Morrison record

THOMAS
And the husbands on board

WF
They want someone they know
Someone they love

a swig of his drink Continues

WF (CONTD)

Of course this artist the one
with the talent hes flattered
Of course he agrees

(and then)
He and the girl walk the city for
hours that night Both of them so
nervous They end up at Washington
Square Park they dance to no music
and then the rest comes easy

THOMAS
And thats where he realizes he
loves her At the fountain in
Washington Square

WF
Yes Thomas youve figured it all
out

finishes his drink

WF (CONTD)
So the couple gives birth to a
wonderful son The husband gives
up art and becomes a very
successful art dealer And they
fall into Upper-Manhattan and all
that means

THOMAS
And the other artist

( )

WF
He sees critical success never
marries takes on many lovers but
never love He watches the boy
grow from a far sees his talent
alive with-in this child

WF takes a breath Lights a cigar The bartender slides
over an ashtray from under the No Smoking sign

WF (CONTD)
And he so desperately wants to
connect with his son To tell him
everything to show the boy his

genetic gift to teach him how to
use it
(and then)
But of course he never does make
contact
THOMAS
Until
WF

Until he does something selfish
Until he decides its all going to
be his next book

THOMAS
I thought he was an artist

WF
He is Thomas Im not Like I
said thinly veiled

And Thomas sees his mother on the stretcher being carted off
into the ambulance She is unconscious and has an oxygen
mask on her face The sight is crippling

As Thomas falls to his knees His tears being washed away by
the rain

INT ST LUKES HOSPITAL — NIGHT
Nathan greets Thomas in the waiting room
THOMAS
They pumped her stomach Shes

going to live

Exhausted and emotionally drained Nathan sits throws his
head in his hands

NATHAN
What was I supposed to do Keep
living a lie Allow myself to be
hijacked by her threats of this

Thomas stares blankly ahead

THOMAS
No

NATHAN

I wasnt in love with her anymore
You have to answer to love Thomas

( )

THOMAS
I agree Just make sure Johanna

Nathan looks up

NATHAN

Thomas nods and heads for the door
THOMAS
You might want to ask her about
Irwin Rosenthal
NATHAN

NATHAN (CONTD)
Where the hell are you going

Without looking back

THOMAS
To answer to love

And with that Thomas is gone
EXT MIDTOWN — NIGHT

Pouring rain Thomas tries to hail a cab but theyre all
filled And he starts to run Through midtown

And Thomas runs through the Las Vegas of Times Square
and it rains on the charm of Chelsea and Thomas runs
through the thin doglegs of the West Village and it
rains on the multicolored fire escapes of The East
Village and Thomas runs into the immigrant-cum-hipster
miasma of the Lower East Side And Thomas finally stops

EXT MIMIS WALK-UP - NIGHT
Thomas frantically hits the buzzer Mimi appears

MIMI

Thomas looks up at the rain clouds yielding to the full moon

THOMAS (CONTD)
Will you walk with me

As she steps out onto the stoop

MIMI
My flight leaves in two hours

THOMAS
Im not perfect Mimi I didnt
even know who I was until tonight
I was hurt that you wouldnt have
me and shocked that she would

As he catches his breath

THOMAS (CONTD)
The world isnt black and white
its gray Its gray Mimi

MIMI

Thomas looks up to the sky

THOMAS

She nods

THOMAS (CONTD)

He offers his hand

THOMAS (CONTD)
Will you come with me

As she takes it

MIMI
Where

EXT WASHINGTON SQUARE PARKFOUNTAIN — NIGHT
A moon so bright you could read by it
AS MIMI AND THOMAS

dance by the fountain to no music

( )

THOMAS
Its a test Mimi A litmus test
To know if youre in love
She bites her lip looks into his eyes

MIMI
And are you Thomas

THOMAS
This test wasnt for me

She nods slight but determined And she slowly kisses
him And he kisses her back

As they continue to dance by the light of the moon

His word trail off into thoughts until

sleeping with that billionaire

THOMAS
Hes not a billionaire anymore
since his divorce

NATHAN
She was going to marry me all the
while keep it going with him Does

THOMAS
People are not always clean and
happy Dad People are layered and
wounded and fragile
And they walk in silence until

Thomas stops and removes something from his pocket
A ring box He opens it and shows Nathan

NATHAN (CONTD)

EXT GOTHAM BAR and GRILL — NIGHT

The busy restaurant illuminates out onto 12th street
We stay outside while Thomas goes in

( )

NATHAN (VO)
(broken and cheerless)
I don’t know Thomas

We watch through the window as Thomas makes his way through
the tables to find Mimi

THOMAS (VO)
Youll survive Dad

As she greets him with a hug and a kiss
And we pull back its a warm spring night

The traffic stalled in a symphony of horns a Nigerian
sells shotty DVDs of current movies on the sidewalk a
woman walks her dogs three teenagers inhale Tasty Delight
on a stoop downtown buzzing with people
THOMAS (VO) (CONTD)

Its what this city does and its

what we do inside of it
AND MANHATTAN

breathing living as it always has and as it always
will while we

FADE TO BLACK

THE END
