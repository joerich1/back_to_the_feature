EXT BURGUNDIAN COUNTRYSIDE - SUNRISE - 1892 1

The first light is breaking over the fields and hedges of
this timeless rural landscape With the clanking of bells
a herd of cows makes its way to the first milking

INT COLETTE FAMILY HOME - BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING 2

The room is simple with a few sticks of worn wooden
furniture A young woman is asleep under the covers with a
cat curled up on the bottom of the bed This is GABRIELLE-
SIDONIE COLETTE or as she will later be known simply
COLETTE

A voice calls from down the corridor - her mother SIDO

SIDO (0S)
Gabrielle

The girl stirs but her eyes remain stubbornly closed

SIDO (0S) (CONT’D)
Gabrielle Wake up

COLETTE
(murmuring)
Let me sleep

SIDO
Come on Gabrielle

Sido is now at the door frame A handsome country woman
forthright and practical - nobody’s fool

COLETTE
What time is it

SIDO
It’s 8 o’clock Willy is coming today

Colette just murmurs
SIDO (cont’d) (CONT’D)
Good Then you won’t want your
hair doing
She disappears After a moment a head emerges from under
the pillow and looks to the empty doorway We get our first
look at the milky skinned precocious whip-smart Colette

EXT COUNTRY TRAIN STATION - DAY 3

A train belches steam as it slowly moves toward the station
A MAN IN A TOP HAT leans out of the window
COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 2

OMITTED 4
EXT TRAIN CARRIAGE - DAY 5
Dismounting Willy sees a waiting carriage across the platform
INT COLETTE FAMILY HOUSE - PARLOR 6
Wearing her best frock Colette carries a large TEA SERVICE
down a corridor and into the main room Willy is seated in

conversation with Sido and JULES the patriarch an affable
old soldier with one leg who is smoking a pipe

JULES
And how is Paris these days
Willy

WILLY

It’s a hot bed It’s “Electric”
Heaving with artists writers
poets all seeking to say

something profound most of them
are too young or crazed but still
they do generate a certain life
force

Colette her hair neatly plaited puts the cups out for
everyone then takes over the teapot and pours

JULES
We were going to see a play in
Paris - weren’t we

SIDO
La Tosca

WILLY
I was at the opening I wouldn’t
bother quite frankly Sarah Bernhardt
did her best she always does but the
piece is too overwrought in a
particularly feminine way
melodramatic in extremis Tears on the
stage but all dry eyes in the house

SIDO

Maybe I’1l go and make up my own mind
WILLY

Well just remember if a book bores

you you can throw it away If a
painting is garish you close your
eyes

(MORE )
COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

WILLY (CONTD)
Whereas bad theatre is like dentistry
you are compelled to stay in the chair
having your skull drilled until the
entire grizzly procedure is over

JULES
Good point Willy Painful business

COLETTE
Though I imagine it must hold a secret
source of enjoyment - for the dentist

Willy raises an appreciative eyebrow and chuckles

WILLY
Indeed Oh - I almost forgot A
small gift

He reaches in his pocket and pulls out a small package

unwraps it to find a SNOW GLOBE OF PARIS

COLETTE
Thank you I’ve read about these

WILLY
Shake it

She does and looks fascinated at the twirling flakes

COLETTE
Look Sido A snow globe

She holds it up for her mother

EXT COLETTE FAMILY HOUSE — LATE AFTERNOON

She

M Willy bids good-bye to Jules Sido and Colette before
the carriage moves off Colette is holding her comfortable

old cat which she hands off to her mother

COLETTE
Sido I’m going for a walk

SIDO
Change your dress first

COLETTE
I’1l stay on the path

SIDO
Change it
COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 4

INT COLETTE FAMILY HOUSE - STAIRS - MINUTES LATER 8

Now in a different dress Colette starts to come down stairs
Hearing her parents talking in the kitchen she slows up
listening carefully

SIDO (0S)
There’s something about him I find
suspect something disingenuous

JULES (0S)
Oh not in my reckoning He’s a
good man He has a reputation
yes but there comes a time ina
man’s life to settle downand
she’s the right age for it She’ll
be twenty next time around

SIDO (0S)
I just worry that he won’t
understand her That girl said her
first word at nine months She was
always reading way ahead of her
class she was the lead in the
school play - every year

JULES (0S)
My dear would anyone be good
enough for you

SIDO
Hmmph

Now on the ground floor Colette waits outside the door as
her parents talk Sido moves into view by the kitchen sink

SIDO (CONTD)
Have you finished the letter to
his father

JULES
I keep starting but I can’t seem
to finish it A girl without a
dowry -that just doesn’t happen
in their circles They may cut him
off if he marries her

SIDO
So they call it off The world
won’t end

As her father talks Colette sneaks back up the last five
stairs

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 5

JULES
Sido he clearly adores her - he’s
visited four times He’ll give her
status not to mention a
tremendous cultural life - the
theater the opera He’ll give her
Paris for heaven’s sakes

Colette comes clumping down the stairs slightly too loudly
and into the room

COLETTE
Can I go now
SIDO
Yes Take this - for blackberries

(hands her a pot)
I’m making a tart tomorrow And
don’t be late back

COLETTE
(eye roll)
I wont

Sido watches her daughter not without suspicion as she
takes off across the garden

EXT SAINT-SAUVEUR — COUNTRYSIDE - LATE AFTERNOON 9

Colette runs down a path then backs up picks a few prime
blackberries and continues on

She moves through the woods with the stealth of an animal
then breaks out across a broad green meadow towards a barn

EXT OLD BARN — LATE AFTERNOON 10
She approaches the gaping black door of a dilapidated barn
INT OLD BARN 11
Entering the darkness Colette blinks to re-adjust her

eyes A flutter of wings attracts her attention She turns

to see an ascending pigeon Then below a tired old horse

COLETTE
Where are you

WILLY
Over here Enjoying the simple
pleasures of country life

Behind a partition she sees Willy reclining on a pile of
straw
COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

COLETTE
You look at home in the hay

WILLY
I think I might be And you look like
a beautiful young country girl Right
there With the lightWhat’s that

Colette shows him putting the bowl between them as she
nestles beside him Her hands are blue with the juice

WILLY (CONTD)

Your fingers are stained

(he takes her hand)
Mm Maybe I could just leave
Paris behind

(he takes a blackberry)
You could feed me berries I’d catch
a fish with my teeth Then come back
here to my cave Like a bear Bliss

COLETTE
I’d like that

WILLY
(he caresses her braids)
Your hair is a phenomenon

COLETTE
In the village they call me “the
girl with the hair”

WILLY
I can see why I’m sure you’re famous
here in your village

COLETTE
A little

She looks down

COLETTE (cont’d) (CONTD)
How long until your train goes

WILLY
In about 40 minutes But I have
to walk to the station

COLETTE
Normally takes me about 15
minutes Will probably take you

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 7

WILLY
Yes Right So if my
calculations are correct

COLETTE
We have time - if we’re quick

WILLY
Yes we do

He smiles moved by her beauty kisses her then breaks
off

COLETTE
What

WILLY
I just can’t say how unimaginably
happy I am Gabrielle

COLETTE
So am I

He holds her by her shoulders firmly

WILLY
I adore you

He kisses her shoulder Feeling his beard brush against her
skin Colette smiles as they move into a passionate embrace A
nearby horse chews hay as they proceed to take their clothes
off

11A INT COLETTE’S BEDROOM NIGHT 11A

Colette sprawls out on the bed her hair in plaits She is
writing a letter in a school exercise book in pencil resting
on an encyclopaedia

COLETTE
Dear Willy As I walked home by the
river the light shining through
the trees my heart filled with a
kind of delicious pride After all
you know all those fine women of
Parisso I must have something
(smiles to herself) )
I want to wake up next to you
Trace your profile with my finger
while you sleep Know that the day
is ours That life is ours for the
taking We will be so entire and
so happy my love

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 8

12 EXT GARDEN - AFTERNOON 12

At the Wedding Party Jules is making a toast Colette and
Willy in front of a MIXED CROWD of WEDDING GUESTS

JULES
It’s the proudest time in a father’s
life but also - I now find - one of
the saddest I have to hand over my
beloved daughter who has lit up our
lives for so long with her wit her
brilliance her beauty I will miss
you Gabrielle Almost as much as
your mother will

A murmur of acknowledgement from the assembled Colette
smiles at her father and catches her mother’s eye holding
back emotion

JULES (CONTD)
But it is no small compensation that I
give her to a man of such inestimable
standing There are many celebrities
in Paris but few are famous enough to
be known by -- by a single name
WILLY - Welcome to the Colette family

Everyone cheers Colette turns to her new husband
glowing

SOME TIME LATER - EVENING

A COUNTRY BAND strikes up COUPLES polka around the
garden

A COUPLE OF PEASANTS carry trays of drinks from a kitchen
tent to the GUESTS Some CHILDREN chase a chicken through the
dancers

WILLY (contd)
This is definitely a country wedding

COLETTE
It’ll make a good story -- in Paris

WILLY
Youll be the story in Paris
Gabrielle Just wait ‘til they
get a look at you

Willy twirls Colette round and round and round
COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 9

13 EXT CITY OF PARIS - EVENING - 1893 13

Across the river Seine - the center of the demi-monde the
Left Bank This is not postcard Paris - the buildings are
sooty and chimneys are filling the sky with smoke On the
quay PEOPLE go about their business as a YOUNG ATTENDANT
lights the gas lamp

14 INT COLETTE AND WILLY’S APARTMENT - BOUDOIR - EVENING 14

MATILDE the maid is winching Colette into a very tight
red froufrou dress A knock on the door

WILLY (0S)
Are you ready yet

COLETTE
No - not yet
(to the maid)
What do you think Matilde

MATILDE
It’s pretty Madame

Colette looks at herself critically
15 INT BEDROOMHALLWAY 15
Willy returns and prepares to knock again

WILLY (0S)
We should try to get there before
it ends

COLETTE (0S)
I’m coming

The door opens Colette is in another dress - the one from
their meeting in Saint-Sauveur Matilde hovers nervously

COLETTE (CONT’D)
Is the carriage waiting

Willy looks disappointed but together they proceed through
SEVERAL ROOMS to the front door We get a feeling for Willy’s
apartment - a warren of dark rooms overcrowded by boxes papers
and Wagnerian bric-a-brac Willy it seems is a hoarder

WILLY
Where’s your new dress

COLETTE
It looks ridiculous I couldn’t
breathe in it

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 10

WILLY
That thing cost me two hundred and
thirty-seven francs

COLETTE
I know We’ll get it adjusted

WILLY
(half joking)
More money

They exit
EXT ELEGANT PARISIAN STREET — EARLY EVENING 16

The carriage pulls up Colette is fiddling with a spot of
tooth powder on her dress

WILLY
What is it

COLETTE
-It’s tooth paste

WILLY
(amused)
My God Here

He rubs a little spit on it

WILLY (CONTD)
That’1ll do Let’s go in

INT MME DE CAILLAVET’S SALON — HALLWAY 17
They approach the giant door

WILLY
Ready for the lions

She lets out a nervous exhale The double doors glide open
INT MADAME DE CAILLAVET’S SALON - MAIN ROOM 18

Willy and Colette proceed into a reception room filled with
the beautiful the sparkling and the eccentric of Paris’
Golden Age The mirrors have been polished so have the
epigrams Amidst the gas lamps the India rubber plants
and the zebra skin rugs the energy is bouncing off the
walls

Willy acknowledges hellos and nods to people along the way
With her tight braids and country dress Colette looks drab
in this sea of peacocks
COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 11

They arrive at a circle of conversation -- that of MME DE
CAILLAVET the hostess the debonair COUNT MUFFAT and a
few SALONITES and FRIENDS

MME DE CAILLAVET
It’s monstrous I can’t look at
it

COUNT MUFFAT
At least it’s temporary

MME DE CAILLAVET
Oh here’s Willy -- Willy Eiffel’s
Tower are you for or against

WILLY
I’m for it if a little jealous of this
giant erection in the heart of our
capital belonging to someone else

Laughter from the circle

MME DE CAILLAVET
You rogue Willy And you’ve
brought a an orphaned relative

COUNT MUFFAT
A secret love child

WILLY
(acknowledging their mockery)
Very good May I present to you
my wife Gabrielle-Sidonie
Colette

Colette curtsies politely her cheeks flushing

COLETTE
Pleased to meet you

MME DE CAILLAVET
Delighted Well astonished
actually You have caught the
slipperiest eel How does one do
that

COLETTE
I’m not sure

Colette smiles a little nervously

MME DE CAILLAVET
Where are you from you sweet thing
COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 12

COLETTE
I’m from Saint-Sauveur-en-Puisaye
(no reaction)
--it’s in Burgundy

MME DE CAILLAVET
Hence the dress

COUNT MUFFAT
Have you “relocated” Willy

This is apparently hilarious and there is laughter

MME DE CAILLAVET
Tstignore him But how on
earth did you two meet

COLETTE
Our fathers served together in the army

COUNT MUFFAT
(riding over her)
Willy married The wild days are done
eh

COLETTE
You’re quite mistaken sir The
wild days have just begun

Willy smiles at his new bride’s moxie A business-like
young man rushes up to Willy This is PIERRE VEBER

VEBER
Willy thank God you’re back That
short story for La Forgue —

WILLY
Pierre Let me introduce you to my
wife Gabrielle

VEBER
What Very pleased to meet you

Before she can speak he turns to Willy with a more urgent tone

VEBER (CONTD)
It’s due on Tuesday and you
haven’t given me the slightest
clue

WILLY
Amuse yourself for a moment Gabrielle

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 13

COLETTE
I will

Willy draws Veber aside to continue the shop talk

WILLY
It’s simple - an eight hundred word
sketch Small coastal resort damp
bathing-costumes The perfect place to
rejuvenate a de-iodized constitution
A buxom girl approaches long legs

Colette is left standing by herself Nearby a silver tray
displays a living turtle with an exquisitely jeweled shell
She takes a lettuce leaf from a salad dish and feeds it

COLETTE
Poor thing You want the earth and
the grass don’t you

Across the room she sees Willy with Veber lifting the glass
on a wall candle and lighting a cigar

Feeling out of sorts she moves through to an adjacent room
where

INT MME DE CAILLAVET’S SALON — MUSIC ROOM 19

A STRING QUARTET is giving a recital to the assembled
Across the room a group of SALONITES are clearly discussing
her Embarrassed Colette finds an empty seat She looks
across the room - the salonites are still whispering

SCHWOB
Are your ears burning

Colette looks up and sees - Marcel SCHWOB an intellectual
with a humane gleam in his eye He sits next to her

SCHWOB (CONTD)
I’m Schwob a friend of Willy’s

COLETTE
Hello I’m Gabrielle Willy
described you to me

SCHWOB
I hope he was kind

COLETTE

(wryly)
Hope costs nothing

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 14

Schwob raises an amused eyebrow then looks out into the
room where people are stealing glances at them

SCHWOB
The modern day mob aren’t they
(Colette nods)
But their goddess is gossip instead of the
guillotine Are you feeling overwhelmed

COLETTE
A little

SCHWOB
They may look grand and intimidating
But just imagine them shitting Each
and every one of them

Colette looks at him incredulous

SCHWOB (CONT’D)
Well they all do don’t they

Across the room AN IMPORTANT-LOOKING GENTLEMAN waves to
Schwob

SCHWOB (CONT’D)
(to the Gentleman)
Good evening Sir
(to Colette)
Try it

AEROPLANE VERSION

SCHWOB (CONT’D)
They may look grand and
intimidating But just imagine
them perched over a chamber pot
Each and every one of them

INT MADAME DE CAILLAVET’S SALON - VARIOUS ROOMS 20

We follow Colette as she searches for Willy in the sea of
SOCIALITES She walks through rooms where PEOPLE are now
dancing in an avant garde fashion then through a series of
SMALLER COMPARTMENTS where SERVANTS are polishing glasses
and CHEFS are preparing hors d’oeuvres past palms and oil
lamps to a distant room at the far end of the salon

INT MME DE CAILLAVET’S SALON — SMOKING ROOM 21

From the doorway Colette spies Willy leaning on the
mantelpiece talking to a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN in a red
dress The woman leans in close to him laughing He
whispers something and she laughs even harder

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 15

Theres a shrieking coming from the corner of the main room
Colette turns to sees the crowd laughing as a BOHEMIAN pours
milk into an upright piano

INT HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE — MOVING — NIGHT 22

Colette looks out the window into the night-time streets
After a moment Willy ventures a question

WILLY
So what did you think of the
salon

WILLY (CONTD)

That was essentially - what you
witnessed tonight - everyone who’s
anyone in Paris

COLETTE
Was it

WILLY
Who did you like Who did you talk to

COLETTE
I liked the tortoise I think he
was as bored as I was

WILLY
I suspect you were more
intimidated than bored

COLETTE
No I found themshallow Pretentious

WILLY
Ah youre reading them wrongly It’s
not pretension so much as
exaggeration The ideal is to be
authentic yet larger than life To
present a personality with a capital
P You could do it too with your
country girl charm

She turns to him
COLETTE
(interrupting)

Did that woman have a capital P

WILLY
Which one

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 16

COLETTE
The one you were talking to In
the red dress With the breasts

WILLY
Nicole D’Allier That was just
flirtation It means absolutely
nothing

COLETTE
Then why do it

WILLY
It’s what one does to pass the time
It staves off boredom You’re reading
it all completely wrong

Colette sighs frustrated Willy changes tack

COLETTE
Maybe

WILLY

Forget about all of them now Any way -

haven’t you heard the news Willy is

married Happily married And he’s

going home with his bride who he

loves very much
Colette nods looks at him with a half-smile He is forgiven
EXT PARIS STREET 23
The carriage rides off into the distance

INT COLETTE AND WILLY’S BUILDING - STAIRCASE - MORNING 24

From directly above we see Pierre Veber dash up the
stairs

INT COLETTE AND WILLY’S APARTMENT - ENTRANCE ROOM 25
Colette is seated at a desk carefully roughing out a
letter She writes a line then crosses it out rephrases
it

There’s a knock at the door Veber enters in the hallway
and looks through to Colette’s small room where she sits
with a large pile of correspondence

COLETTE
Hello Veber

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 17

VEBER
Gabrielle It’s cold out there today

COLETTE
I’m under house arrest so it
doesn’t affect me
(gestures to the other room)
Schwob’s already in there

We follow Veber through the maze-like apartment to Willy’s
office He passes through the front room which is semi-dark
its furniture covered by dust sheets

INT WILLY’S STUDY 26

Willy mid-flow barely notices Veber enter Schwob sits by
an oil lamp taking notes

WILLY
So something like”all the humor and
vivacity descends intoa dreadful
melodramatic swamp Or it released

the toxins of man’s very soul leaving
the audience pale and nauseous as
though having eaten a bad oyster”

SCHWOB
It’s a bit extreme The ending was
actually quite touching

Willy thinks for a moment

WILLY
Hmmph - I prefer my version

He finally acknowledges the new arrival

WILLY (CONTD)
Veber

VEBER
Willy Schwob

WILLY
(to Schwob)
So drop in those embellishments
and file it at The Echo before
six

SCHWOB
Will do
(he leaves)

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

WILLY
The factory’s on fire We’re on
fire Sit I’ve hada
remarkable idea - it could be
anyway

VEBER
What is it

WILLY
I’m going to launch a novel

VEBER
What

WILLY
We’ve had stories by Willy music
reviews by Willy Now Willy’s first
novel There’1ll be enough literature
in it to appeal to the high-brows and
enough filth for the great unwashed

VEBER
And who’s going to write it

WILLY
-you are

Veber shakes his head absorbing this

WILLY (CONT’D)
Brandy Cigar

INT ENTRANCE ROOM

Schwob stops to chat to Colette by the desk Matilde
stoking the fire

SCHWOB
Are you writing for him too He’s
made you one of his ghosts
already

COLETTE
Just letters

SCHWOB
Youre fastidious exacting

COLETTE
A lot of crossing out you mean

SCHWOB
--well yes

is

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 19

COLETTE
Willy copies them out afterwards -
so they are in his handwriting

MATILDE
No one has handwriting like M Willy

28 INT WILLY’S STUDY 28

Willy is completely absorbed in his pitch sweat beading
from his forehead as he paces

WILLY
He first sees her Monna held aloft on
the shoulders of her admirers She’s
eighteen beautiful wild and she’s from
the streets eats men up never wears a
corset And our hero Renaud - a writer
a genius - he’s captivated by her She
seduces him in her shabby rooms - five
entire days of carnal bliss - but she has
a powerful hold over him She
instinctively understands his base
desires We wonder - will Renaud escape -
go back to his wholesome friends and his
burgeoning career - or will he be dragged
down by her toxic embrace forgetting all
about writing to live forever in a sexual
quagmire

Willy ends with a flourish eyes slightly damp
29 INT COLETTE AND WILLY’S APARTMENT 29

Colette gets up from her desk as Willy escorts Veber
through the apartment

WILLY
How long do you think it will
take

VEBER

Two or three months

WILLY
No noweeks Veber It has to be weeks
Write for four hours at a time

VEBER
All right I’11l come back to you if
I get stuck
COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 20

WILLY
YesJust write itand fast
Let’s get some money coming in

VEBER
Goodbye Gabrielle

She waves The door closes on Veber A piece of wallpaper
has pulled free of the wall Willy rubs it back in place

WILLY
Chaos Working in these
conditions Absolutechaos

Willy comes over to his wife and kisses her as they walk
back into the front room

WILLY (CONTD)
You’ve married a literary
entrepreneur What a phenomenal
disaster

COLETTE
You’ve married a country girl Not a
penny to her name

WILLY
We’re utterly doomed aren’t we

They both laugh She hands him the rough draft of the
letter He peruses it quickly

WILLY (CONTD)
Perfect but how about “The
contract you have sent me seems
eminently fair with only one
shortcoming - the money” Always
pump something up before you prick
it You get more of a “POP” that
way

Unexpectedly Willy farts

COLETTE
Willy

WILLY
Intimacy in all its savage
abandon my love I’ve a few
meetings today Let’s meet at La
Mascotte at nine No make it ten

Ah my dear You’ve come to fetch
me
EXT COURTYARD - LATE AFTERNOON 43

Now walking back down the stairs Colette is struggling
mightily to keep her emotions in check as Willy blusters
COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 23

WILLY
She’s not a disreputable woman
There’s even a play about her - it’s a
shit play but nevertheless I wonder

who the hell wrote that letter

COLETTE
I don’t care who wrote it

WILLY
She’s no rival to you Gabrielle
I promise I’1ll never sleep with
her again But - you have to
understand - this is what men do
We are the weaker sex We don’t
have your strength We are simply
slaves to our urges And here in
the city - it’s perfectly
acceptable to

Colette flies at him with inarticulate rage

COLETTE
I don’t accept it You’ve been lying to
me All this time I wait for you all day

because you say we have no money

Sido and Colette are hanging out laundry Colette seems to
be only half-listening - her mind is elsewhere

SIDO
the Laurent girl had her baby
last week It was over nine
pounds but she managed well
enough She called her “Monique
Francoise” The christening is
next month Oh and the Durands
moved away

COLETTE
Really Why

SIDO
He inherited a house In Lorraine
I’11l miss them

Colette manages a half smile

SIDO (CONT’D)
I’m glad that you’re home How
long do you think you’ll stay

COLETTE
I don’t know Sido

SIDO
It must seem boring to you Compared
to Paris

COLETTE
No Not at all

EXT SIDO’S KITCHEN GARDEN - DAY

Colette and Sido are kneeling together in the soil

They

tie some young tomato plants An ANT crawls up one of the

stems

SIDO
Agh - ants There must be honeydew

COLETTE
(feels the leaf)
Yes it’s sticky

SIDO
The white flies have probably got to it
They’1l have sucked all the juice

COLETTE
We need some ladybirds

SIDO
Or a spider There’s a big one
that’s dangling in my room I’1l
catch her and put her to work out
here

Colette stops looks at Sido
COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

COLETTE
Did you ever feel like you were
playing a part Sido

SIDO
In what way

COLETTE
As a wife or a mother That you
were just going through the motions

Sido thinks Inspects the other leaves

SIDO
Sometimes as a wife Never as a
mother Why

Colette shakes her head perturbed

SIDO (CONTD)
Is he good to you Gabri
(Colette’s eyes tear up)
What is it my love

Colette finally opens up

COLETTE
Nothing’s how I imagined it

SIDO
Come here

Colette falls into her mother

SIDO (CONT’D)
My darling kitten No one can take
away what you are - no one You’re
too strong for that Always have
been Trust no one but yourself

COLETTE
I know

SIDO
What’s he done to upset you

COLETTE
Nothing Nothing
(she pulls away)
It’s all - just - new That’s all

48 EXT SAINT SAUVEUR - RIVER BANK - DAY 48

Willy and Colette walk along the dappled banks of the green
slow river She is distant He is persistent

WILLY
Are you happy to be here

COLETTE
Yes It makes the city seem even
more foul

WILLY
Well you are a country girl

She rolls her eyes

WILLY (CONT’D)
Did you miss me

COLETTE
(lies)
No not really

WILLY
Life has beenawful without you
Just dead

His tone grows more emotional She holds firm

WILLY (CONTD)
I don’t feel like myself at all
Everything seemsutterly
pointless I can’t even write
anymore
You mean more to me than all the
women of Paris put together

COLETTE
Have you sampled them all

WILLY
Please don’t mock me

COLETTE
You’re happy to mock everybody
else

WILLY
It’s true It’s all horseshit Words
are deceptive little bastards
(MORE )
COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 28

WILLY (CONTD)
but if you trace mine to their source -
to my bruised aching heart

COLETTE
I wouldn’t credit that as the organ
of origin

He snorts

WILLY
You know me too well

COLETTE
I can read you like the top line
of an opticians chart

WILLY
That’s wonderful Did you make it up
(she shakes her head exasperated)
Justtell me what you want
Gabrielle And I’1l do it

She turns faces him

COLETTE
I know who you are Willy And
maybe I knew all along But I want
you not to lie to me

WILLY
I won’t Never again I promise

COLETTE
I don’t want to be treated like a
little wife at home I want to
know what’s going on Whatever it

may be I want to be part of
things

WILLY
You will be You will be part of
everything

He gives her his most sincere eyes He puts his arms round
her and their voices get quieter as they walk further away

WILLY (CONT’D)
--and I’ll even buy you a dog

COLETTE
I’m being serious

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

WILLY

So am I

(he looks around)

This river is so beautiful

COLETTE
Yes me and Luce used to come

swimming here after school

WILLY

You did She

COLETTE
No - but she was always with me

INT COLETTE FAMILY HOUSE - BEDROOM

she could also be very annoying

Willy is now in bed Colette is undressing They talk
quietly so as not to wake Sido

Well she was clumsy more than
anything One day in winter when

the first snows started

Get in I’m like a pot-bellied

Colette gets in and clings to him Willy warms her hands

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 30

COLETTE
It finally got to Luce who
“dropped” itWe both got
detention she’d do anything to
be close to me

Willy laughs

WILLY
I bet she did

He kisses her They re-engage passionately and make love

INT COLETTE FAMILY HOME - UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR 50

Sido in her nightgown carries an oil lamp down the
corridor From Colette’s bedroom comes the rhythmic creaking
of the bed springs that she does her best to ignore

EXT PARIS - MORNING - 1895 51

An aerial shot moves over the rooftops churches squares
and streets of Paris

INT COLETTE AND WILLY’S APARTMENT 52

Colette comes out of the kitchen eating a peach A little
BULLDOG comes scampering after her This is Toby Chien She
hears an argument and moves stealthily through the apartment
to ascertain its source Through the door she sees Pierre
Veber (angry) and Schwob (diplomatic) in front of Willys
desk

WILLY

Get out Both of you This is harassment
SCHWOB

Willy come on You’re not being

fair
VEBER

This is the third time I’ve had to
come round and ask you for it

WILLY
Then stop coming round and bloody
well asking

VEBER
I am close to being evicted You
owe me 400 francs You’d get the
advance from Ollendorff you said
COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 31

WILLY
And I will - by Friday

VEBER
You said that last week

SCHWOB
A factory needs to pay its workers Willy

WILLY
Go on strike then Get some other idiot
to hire you Leave me alone Both of you
I’1ll have your money by Friday

VEBER
You’d better bloody have it

Veber walks briskly into the living room nods to Colette
too angry to speak and exits Schwob follows saying
goodbye

Willy emerges forlorn and starts to get ready to leave

WILLY
Damn them They’d never get
published by themselves I lend them
my name my reputation I take all
the risk And there’s no money We
simply need more output

COLETTE
You could get another writer in

WILLY
And pay them with what We only have
about 1000 coming in this month - 300
from the Echo 425 for the next vamp
novel and 250 from the music reviews
But it doesn’t cover our outgoings

COLETTE
How can we spend that much

WILLY
The mortgage Matilde restaurants

COLETTE
You always pick up the bill
Willy however many people join
us

WILLY
It’s expected
COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 32

COLETTE
And the casino And the races

WILLY
What do you want me to do Live
like a monk Or a peasant

COLETTE
I’m just saying we could
economize Mademoiselle Terrain

always used to say “Look after
the pennies and”

Then lightning strikes

WILLY
You You

COLETTE
What

WILLY

You could write them up Those stories of
Saint-Sauveur you told me last year They
could be Willy’s next novel

COLETTE
My school stories

WILLY
Yes There may be something
thereYou must start straight
away my love Aim for four hours
at a time - the wolves are at the
door

He goes back to his study Colette’s mind is racing
INT ENTRANCE ROOM — MOMENT’S LATER 53

Sitting at a desk exercise book open Colette dips her
fountain pen in the ink A statuette of Willy is perched in
the front of the desk overlooking her She writes SCHOOL

WILLY

COLETTE
I only just stopped writing

Willy sits on the bed belches and takes off his boots

WILLY
Did you manage four hours

COLETTE
Twice that At least

WILLY

Really You

must be a natural

COLETTE

I’ve changed a few thingsfor the

story But it might ruffle a few
feathers back home

WILLY
Don’t worry about the facts You can
add a character make up an event
Adapt it to the times All people
really want is the feeling the
emotion - that great sweep of

narrative

Save it for the book

INT ENTRANCE ROOM —- DAY 56

MUSIC STARTS UP We see Colette label a new exercise book
SCHOOL NOTES PART 3 before she starts on the fresh page

COLETTE (VO)
“These are the copses where bushes
spitefully catch your face as you pass
Those are full of sun and strawberries
and lilies-of-the-valley andsnakes
I’ve shuddered there with choking terror
at the sight of those dreadful smooth
cold bodies gliding in front of my
feet’

She is completely absorbed

COLETTE (VO)
“I feel so much alone there my eyes
lost far away amongst the trees in the
green mysterious daylight that is at
once deliciously peaceful and a little
unnerving because of the loneliness and
the vague darkness”

INT WILLY’S STUDY - MORNING 57
There’s a pile of five notebooks on Willy’s desk with a
ribbon round them and a label that says “For Willy”
Seated behind his desk Willy unties the precious package
picks up the first book and settles in to read it

After a few pages he takes a cigar and lights it

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 58

Colette is playing with TOBY CHIEN on the floor She gets
up and looks at the grandfather clock in the hall - 130

congratulatory but awkward

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

She nods

COLETTE

WILLY (CONTD)
SoI’1l treat you like any other
writer I’m giving a report to shall

COLETTE
Yes

WILLY
Except I love you I adore you
Let’s be clear about that

COLETTE
Just tell me

He finishes up zips up and comes into the bedroom

She says

Not wanting to break in front of Willy

WILLY
There’s nothing driving it No
plot A novel by Willy It grips
you from page one Yours has
(he gestures )

-too many adjectives Some of
the characters are interesting but
overall Well it’s just too
cloying Toofeminine

nothing stares at the floor anger mounting

COLETTE
Well that was a waste of nine
months

WILLY

Not if you enjoyed it

through the apartment

INT WILLY’S STUDY

Colette slams the door behind her eyes brimming with

she storms off

tears She opens the notebook and looks at the first page
“School Notes by Gabrielle-Sidonie Colette” She
takes a pen crosses out her name

It says

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 37

And stops leaving the single word “Colette” She looks at
it for a moment tears in her eyes and underlines it

INT MME DE CAILLAVET’S SALON - MUSIC ROOM - EVENING 61

A makeshift stage where the famous mime artist WAGUE
performs a lip-sync sketch accompanied by a PIANIST and a
FEMALE SINGER The audience is transfixed by his mastery of
the form

Colette and Schwob are at the edge of the crowd Colette is
dressed in black and white her style feels modern and edgy -
well ahead of the fussily-dressed socialites

COLETTE

Wague’s mesmerizing isn’t he
SCHWOB

Yes - he’s the king of

cantomime

The song plays out its last few lines Everyone bursts into
applause

SCHWOB (CONTD)
Let’s get a drink

MOMENTS LATER
Two champagne glasses are taken off a tray
COLETTE
(to the servant)

Thank you Geraud

SCHWOB
Cheers

They clink glasses

SCHWOB (CONTD)
How’s it going with your book

COLETTE
It’s gone I tried but it wasn’t
any good

SCHWOB

I can’t believe it

COLETTE
Willy hated it I don’t care I don’t
need to leave a mark on this world
(MORE )
COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 38

COLETTE (CONTD)
Give me a flock of starlings and
that will intoxicate me Something
real Not just doing lines for the
headmaster
(takes a moment)
Did you always write Schwob

SCHWOB
I didn’t really have a choice It was
simply There

COLETTE

Does it make you happy

SCHWOB
Oh god no I do it to prevent me
from going mad But sometimes
occasionally it will transport
me

This registers with Colette Despite her bravura - she misses
it They are interrupted by a beautiful couple GASTON and
JEANNE de CAILLAVET

GASTON
Hello Schwob Good to see you
SCHWOB
Hello Gaston Jeanne Do you know
Colette
JEANNE
I think we’ve been introduced
but I don’t remember that name
COLETTE

It’s new - in a manner of speaking

JEANNE
Well then I will think of this as
our first meeting

Schwob looks from one to the other sensing a definite
energy
INT MME DE CAILLAVET’S SALON - ENTRY ROOM 62

WILLY
Yes maybe one day they will do my
building

MME DE CAILLAVET
It’s so much safer too Even if the
light is a little bright

WILLY
Indeed If you’ll excuse me

Willy makes his exit and looks through the crowd for
Colette He rounds a corner and sees through one room in
which PEOPLE ARE DANCING into a far room where Colette
GASTON and JEANNE DE CAILLAVET are sitting together

INT MME DE CAILLAVET’S SALON - SMOKING ROOM 62a

The newly introduced friends are all already quite tipsy
They are sitting in front of a MIRRORED WALL that reflects
the DANCERS Gaston is reading Colette’s palm As Willy
stares a flicker of jealousy passes through his eyes

GASTON
You have a long life line Very
strong head line - here And your
love line splits in three

COLETTE
And what could that mean

JEANNE
Who knows

Gaston laughs somewhat flirtatiously

GASTON
So many intersecting lines

COLETTE
I have the hands of a man - see

She measures up to Gaston - hers are larger

JEANNE
You have a touch of Hermes
Colette There’s something
androgynous about you

GASTON
No I know what it is You’ve the
soul of Narcissus Filled with
sensuality and bitterness

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

COLETTE
My soul is filled with beans and
bacon rinds You’1l find nothing
else there

They all laugh Willy arrives in front of them

GASTON DE CAILLAVET
Willy you ogre how are you We’ve
been greatly enjoying the company of
Colette - now she is no longer hiding
her light under a bushel

WILLY
Quoting the good book Gaston You
May remember a little verse about
coveting other men’s wives

GASTON
And you may remember one about not
trying to remove a speck from your
brother’s eye with a log in your own

WILLY
(amused)
Touché Gaston Your wits are improving
somewhat We’d better go now darling

INT CARRIAGE - MOVING - NIGHT

WILLY
His first play was absolute
rubbish - but his mother runs a
salon so of course it was a huge
success and he was praised to the
skies for his brilliant “writing”
and sublime “talent” Unctuous
prick He was after you

COLETTE
Willy he’s not that type Besides
they just got married

WILLY
They’re no longer on honeymoon my
dear

Colette looks at him slightly amused

COLETTE
Your jealousy is misplaced

WILLY
Why so

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 41

COLETTE
It was actually his wife I found
interesting

WILLY
Jeanne

COLETTE
Yes

Willy considers this

COLETTE (CONT’D)
What would you think of that

WILLY
Well that’s a different case

COLETTE
It is

WILLY
Perhaps

Willy smiles to himself

bailiffs

BAILIFF
Good Morning Ma’am I need to speak
to the gentleman of the house

COLETTE
What is it

BAILIFF
Monsieur Henri Gautier Villar - Is
he in

COLETTE
You can speak to me about whatever
it is

BAILIFF

Willy walks up the hallway

WILLY
Yes What is it

BAILIFF
Sir I have a repossession order for
two arm chairs one armoire one oak
desk

WILLY
Do you have the court papers

BAILIFF
Here you are All in order

Willy surveys them and resigned steps to the side

COLETTE

WILLY
It’s only bits of wood
(to the Bailiffs)
The chairs are in the front parlour
Armoire’s in the bedroom

COLETTE
With all my clothes in

She storms off in exasperation Willy goes into the office
INT COLETTE AND WILLY’S APARTMENT - OFFICE 66
The desk is surrounded by piles of paper and envelopes He

clears the papers out of the second lowest drawer and opens
the bottom drawer Inside are a stack of school notebooks —

Colette’s novel He picks them out of the drawer

BAILIFF
Ready

WILLY
Take it Take it away

He opens the book and flips through a few pages Then a few
more his curiosity aroused

Willy sits on a single chair in the middle of the room

This time he’s engaged - gripped He makes margin notes in
spidery handwriting

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 43

WILLY

Then he skips back to the first page where it says “School
Notes by (crossing out) Colette” He neatly rips out the
page and screws it up

INT COLETTE AND WILLY’S APARTMENT - WILLY’S STUDY — NIGH8

In a pool of gaslight Willy and Colette are seated at the
desk Willy is going through his notes

WILLY
-example “it’s a lovely spring

“Perhaps it’s the season It’s too
fine - almost disgracefully fine”

She scribbles it down

WILLY (CONTD)
And page 29 - that scene with
Luce

(he finds it)
I’ve added “she brushes up
against me suggestively her blue
eyes half closed and her mouth
half-open”

COLETTE
That’s quite louche

WILLY
Louche sells my dear Trust me -
all we need is a little more spice
a little less literature I know
what men want And so do the
publishers

Colette ponders this for a moment - not completely satisfied

COLETTE
And you really think they’1ll take
it
WILLY
Yes Ollendorff will go nuts for it
COLETTE
(ironically)

As you did on first reading

Perhaps - 20000 units or 25000
somewhere in that ballpark I’m
waiting to see what the pre-orders
are like back from the sellers

And what kind of return would that
yield

INT COUNTRY HOUSE - DAY 84

They enter the formerly-grand old house - still beautiful

COLETTE
-Whose house is it

WILLY
For you my love my heart Lest
Paris drive you mad

COLETTE
What

WILLY
It’s yours You’re always talking
about missing the countryside

Willy kisses the key and gives it to Colette who stares at
him and then again at the house

COLETTE
Willy I can’t believe it

WILLY
Bugger the roses We have a deadline

COLETTE
It’s actually harder to write out
here Alone And I don’t want to
write another Claudine

WILLY
Are you out of your mind Claudine
is a franchise Do you realize how
rare this moment is When people
are begging for more Come

He walks her through the house and up the stairs

WILLY (CONTD)
What would the headmaster do if
Claudine had not done her
homework

COLETTE
Willy Don’t be silly

WILLY
(serious )
What would he do

COLETTE
(sarcastic)
Make her do lines Put her over
his knee and tan her hide

WILLY
Correct

He arrives at the door of the study and stands expectantly

at the door jamb as she walks past him into the study

COLETTE
Ill start tomorrow

resignation to the writing desk

MOMENTS LATER

She sits for a moment still smarting from the exchange dips
her pen in the ink and writes “Claudine in Paris”

EXT BOIS DE BOULOGNE - DAY 92

A beautiful day PARISIANS are promenading and riding
bicycles and velocipedes in the open air Colette and Willy
are pedaling a tandem She’s at the front putting in most of
the leg work he true to form is taking it easy at the
back

Under the trees a cafe has been set up with delicate folding
chairs and small round tables A few dozen SOCIETY TYPES are
enjoying tea and cakes

Depositing their tandem by a tree Colette and Willy
approach There is a feeling that all eyes are on them

Walking through the tables they go past a beautiful red-headed
heiress named GEORGIE Raoul Duval She is taking tea with her
companion a pretty young girl named LILY
LILY
(whispering)
Colette and Willy are here

GEORGIE
So they are Don’t stare

Across the patio Colette and Willy are seated by a WAITER
Georgie takes out a small card and scribbles a note

GEORGIE (CONTD)
Go take this to them

MOMENTS LATER
Post-exercise the couple are eating cake

COLETTE
Mmmm It’s good

WILLY
Indeed

He looks round

WILLY (CONTD)
How many people here do you think
are reading Claudine in Paris -
right now

COLETTE
I don’t know
COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 56

WILLY
At least three quarters Id say
And those who haven’t yet will soon
catch up

He notices Lily weaving through the tables towards them
WILLY (CONT’D)

(to himself)
What comes this way

LILY
M Willy Mme Colette I have a note
for youfrom Mrs Raoul Duval

Clearly a little starstruck she hands Willy the note and he
surveys it

WILLY
(remembering)
Mrs Raoul Duval Georgie Raoul Duval

LILY
Yes

WILLY
Oh wonderful Please go tell
your mistress we accept her
invitation and look forward to her
delightful company

LILY
(thrilled)
I will
And off she goes
COLETTE

Who is she

WILLY
(under his breath)
-An American - a wayward
debutante from Louisiana she
married a munitions magnate three
times her age

COLETTE
They sound a bit dull

WILLY
He is She is anything but
(glances at her)
We don’t have to

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 57

COLETTE
No Let’s go

INT CAFE NOIR - EVENING 93

In the high ceilinged cafe we follow a WAITER who drops a
bill off at a table where Georgie and Colette are in fits of
hysterics - the kind of laughter sustained by the seriously
drunk and flirtatious Willy is providing the after-dinner
entertainment Lily sits by them awed at getting to spend
time with such celebrities autograph book at the ready

GEORGIE
(almost crying with
laughter)
That’s so funny Did he really say that

COLETTE
Oh yes - he would He is such a
colossal snob

WILLY
Then Mme de Caillavet happened to
mention that he was only a baron
and not a Marquise “Allow me he
said “I am also Duke of Anjou
Bishop of Coutances Prince of
Joinville of Asturias of Orléans
and the Dunes But all that isnt
of the slightest importance
(with perfect timing)
-here”

Everyone howls with laughter A stray curl of her hair
falls down over Georgie’s face

COLETTE
Wait a moment

Colette takes the lock and tries to pat it back into place
A moment of electricity passes between the two Willy
watches fascinated

COLETTE (CONTD)
Hold still That’s it

She takes her hands away The disobedient lock immediately
falls back down The women lose it

The waiter comes back by the table
WILLY

(paying the bill)
Here you are
COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 58

WAITER
Thank you Monsieur Willy

GEORGIE
Is the evening over already I
can’t bear it
(turning to her assistant)
Lily go tell the coachman to ready
the carriage

LILY
Of course

Lily doesn’t get up though

GEORGIE
Well

LILY
I’m sorry Ma’am but
(thrusting an autograph
book forward)
M Willy may I have your autograph

WILLY

Of course My pleasure I’1l even
do you a doodle Of me

LILY
Oh thank you

He hands it back Georgie looks impatient

LILY (CONTD)
And yours too Madame Colette

GEORGIE
Oh come now

COLETTE
Not at all Spirit should always
be rewarded

She returns the book to Lily who positively vibrates with
excitement

WILLY
Good night my dear

LILY
Good night

She hurries off
COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

GEORGIE
Well I live at 74 Rue Goethe If you’d
like to stop by for at nightcap

The question hangs in the air
WILLY

Thank you so much But I feel like I
will retire this evening

GEORGIE
Are you sure now

COLETTE
Willy

WILLY

We’ll play again soon my dear

GEORGIE
YesI hope so Before my bore of
a husband returns Well adieu

And she’s gone Willy weighs this

COLETTE
You don’t want to go

WILLY
The invitation was clearly for
you

This really lands for Colette

COLETTE
Should I

WILLY
Yes of course

COLETTE
You don’t mind

WILLY
Id be a hypocrite if I did
wouldn’t I

Colette considers this

WILLY (CONTD)
If it’s any comfort to you I will be
at home lying in bed thinking of the
two of you in the fondest way possible

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 60

nervousness and her excitement She knocks on the door After
a moment’s waiting Georgie answers

GEORGIE

Georgie’s apartment naturally is very stylish

COLETTE
What a nice place

GEORGIE
Thank you This is my little pied-a-tere
Frederick is not so keen on the Art Nouveau
pieces But I love natureand women

Colette looks at a painting of nymphs bathing

COLETTE
I can see that

GEORGIE
I remember in Claudine At School when the
girls go swimming together at night

COLETTE
Night is the best time to swim

GEORGIE
When I was a girl I was told all
the lakes in Louisiana have
alligators So I never went for a
midnight swim but I regret it

Georgie looks down then raises her eyes towards Colette
COLETTE
When you raise your eyelids it’s as
if you were taking off all my clothes
Georgie looks down blushing
COLETTE (CONTD)
Don’t look away Look at me Look

at me looking at you

She does It’s electric Colette slowly moves in and
kisses her for a long hot moment
COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 61

with a question

independence

As Georgie is finishing up her morning toilet there’s the
ring of a doorbell

GEORGIE
(murmurs )
One moment my darling

She hastily wraps herself in a gown and makes her way through

As she opens the door she is taken a back to see the bald
pate of Monsieur Willy

GEORGIE (CONTD)
Oh

Still no answer Colette knocks hard on the door

COLETTE (CONT’D)
Georgie Open up

More loud knocks Eventually Georgie answers in a
nightgown

GEORGIE
Colette I was taking a nap

Colette pushes past her

COLETTE
Who’s been in here

GEORGIE
No one What are you doing

Colette looks to the bedroom where tell-tale cigar smoke
hangs in layers

INT COUNTRY HOUSE - STUDY - DAY 106
Colette is writing at her desk

COLETTE (VO)
Blue cigar smoke feted the air
(she pauses crosses out
then continues)
I marched in and looked straight in the
face of the Renaud He recoiled saying
“It was wicked of me I’m sorry”

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 65

Colette looks at the statue of Willy on her desk
wistfully

COLETTE (VO)
Rezi was there of course she was
there - covering herself up

INT COUNTRY HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT 107

Colette and Willy’s voices merge as the story transfers
over

WILLY
---I shall always remember her lily
white face decomposing as if it were
dying right under my gaze

Once again at the desk under the circle of light Willy is
reading aloud from the notebooks giving his customary
polish to the latest Claudine Colette sits quietly by as
this chapter of their own lives is read But she has more
confidence now - more poise She is growing into herself

He sets the book down A moment’s thought

WILLY (CONTD)
It’s good

COLETTE
I know

WILLY
I’d suggest you change the line when
Renaud says “It was wicked of me to
do it” But I know that you wont

COLETTE
(piqued)
What do you think Renaud would
say in those circumstances

WILLY
Hmmmsomething like “Whywe
were waiting for you my dear”

COLETTE
I don’t think she would believe him

WILLY
Of course not

This is a sore point
COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

WILLY (CONTD)
But don’t you think she’s being
hypocritical - I mean it’s acceptable
for Claudine to sleep with Rezi but
she doesn’t want Renaud to do the
same

COLETTE
Not behind her back no The betrayal
came when Renaud lied to her Renaud
who swore he would always be honest

WILLY
Perhaps he wanted to tell her but he
was frightened of her terrible
jealousy

COLETTE
Then he was a coward as well as a
liar

WILLY
You’re very harsh on him

COLETTE
Who else will be And Renaud would
never be jealous If for instance
Claudine went off with A young
man for a change

WILLY
He would find that unacceptable

COLETTE
Infidelity for Renaud is a matter
of gender

WILLY
It is
(clears his throat)
How long have you known

COLETTE
For a month or so

Colette has won this one Willy clears his throat

WILLY
Well I must say I’m impressed with the
way you’ve handled yourself The
younger Claudine would have thrown a
fit
COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 67

COLETTE
I’m planning on killing Renaud off
in the next one

WILLY
No - you can’t Please

COLETTE
(quoting Willy)
“The hand that holds the pen writes
history”

Willy shoots her an amused but slightly threatened look

WILLY

Renaud’s moral shadings aside the
writing is very good Quite a work
of art Those little scratches you
make on the paper -

(he indicates)
- very powerful And it will have a
powerful effect Everyone will immediately
know whom it’s about there will be a huge
scandal the books will spread like
thistledown all over France

COLETTE
And M Willy will have yet another
hot book on his hands

An uneasy truce has been declared

WILLY (contd)
You know what I’m tempted to go
back and put even more Georgie into
Rezi

COLETTE
Willy we have to draw the line
somewhere
WILLY
Why my dear Our marriage is
already public domain

What

GEORGIE
I’ve put him off Hopefully it
won’t come to that
(she looks at Colette)
You’ve read it yes

COLETTE
I have

GEORGIE
How worried should I be

Georgie walks across to her with the drink
COLETTE

The names have all been changed
It’s not blatantly obvious who is

who

GEORGIE
I don’t believe you Everyone is
chattering about it - saying it

will be salacious in the extreme

(She clears her throat)
I know you have no time for me since our
separation and I know I behaved badly
But I’m begging you Ask Willy to
change it - before publication

Colette slowly shakes her head
GEORGIE (CONT’D)
Please Colette One woman to

another Please

COLETTE
No I can’t

GEORGIE
You’d let me suffer
COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

COLETTE
It’s not just Willy Georgie
it’s the book itselfWilly

thinks it’s a work of art

Georgie downs her drink and switches gears - no more
a hardness comes to her eyes

You had your chance to be decent So
it will be left to my husband to settle
it
Ollendorff has agreed to a lump sum for
the destruction of the entire print

can’t

daughter was burnt at the stake

COLETTE
I said it would be a “hot book”

WILLY
The thing is though Ollendorff signed
the deal but unfortunately failed to
mention
(drum rolls the table)
That he didn’t own the copyright I

do
SCHWOB
Unbelievable
WILLY

All I had to do was trot round to
another publisher and collect a second
advance The presses are hard at it as
we speak

SCHWOB
How do you two do it

COLETTE
I think we got very lucky

WILLY
Not at all That American tart
and her senile lackey didn’t stand
a chance We are with the times
The wind is under our wings And I
have a little plan that will make
Claudine the most popular girl in
France if not the entire world

SCHWOB
With the play

Not just that We’ll have Claudine
perfume Claudine lingerie
Claudine soap

Montigny I was born there in
1881 I shall probably not die
there

Colette and Willy are sitting in the tenth row of the theatre
In front of them are the DIRECTOR and two FINANCIERS

Colette now in her late twenties seems to have grown
comfortable in her skin Willy on the other hand is showing
the tell-tale signs of a life too-well lived

WILLY
She’s not bad

COLETTE
She’s terrible

INSIPID ACTRESS

Montigny is a village not a town
its streets thank heaven are not
paved the showers roll down them
in little torrents that dry up in
a couple hours it is a village
not even a very pretty village
but all the same I adore it

(to Colette)
Yes you’re right

little gestures and mannerisms that I do

WILLY

COLETTE
Do you think I could act

Waste of what

Willy shrugs dismissing the thought He picks up a photo
and examines it closer

long hair

Napoleon approaches Colette This we will find out

Everyone’s here Look there’s the
Marquise de Belbeuf or Missy as
she’s known

A woman

SCHWOB
Descended from Empress Josephine
on one side the Tsar of Russia on
the other - She only shows up for
very special occasions

the corner where Polaire is making her entrance carried
aloft on a litter by FOUR MUSCULAR GUYS She is showered
with praise and flowers

She acquiesces and lands on his other knee Willy is now
framed by two “Claudines” with perfect bobbed hair He
waves to a photographer

She gives Willy a knowing smile

EXT BOIS DE BOULOGNE - DAY

Yes calla palustris

There’s not many people in Paris
who would know their proper name

botanist He was always away -
collecting samples down in the
tropics

COLETTE
My maternal grandfather spent time
in the tropics too He was a
quadroon

In a quiet lane away from the crowds Colette and Missy
walk Toby Chien The Marquise is very affable but also a
little reserved - like a polite gentleman of the day

Really

COLETTE
Yes from Martinique

Missy raises an approving eyebrow

MISSY
Wonderful

Two young women walk by dressed as Claudines giggling

MISSY (CONT’D)
Congratulations by the way It
seems that Claudines are
everywhere these days

COLETTE
Yes There’s even been a
Claudine murderess - in
Marseilles She slit her husband’s
throat

MISSY

Good for her
Colette can’t help but smile

MISSY (CONTD)
But seriously you’ve done
something important You’ve
invented a type

COLETTE
You mean Willy has

MISSY
I mean you have All the young
girls between girlhood and
womanhood - you give them a voice

Colette says nothing A force of personality is breaking
through Missy’s reserve

MISSY (CONTD)
You should own up to it

COLETTE
Someone told you

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 87

MISSY
Didn’t need to be told Meeting
you was enough You are a force of

nature

COLETTE
It’s true II wrote them It’s
just

MISSY

I know It’s a man’s world

They exchange a look Ahead of them is a more populated
thoroughfare They hover for a moment in the shade of the
last tree cherishing their improvised privacy Colette
kisses her fingers and places them on Missy’s lips as a
carriage goes rattling past

brave - a true gentle man I will
think of you if I may as my

you - ten years ago

COLETTE
Nothing like But she is very sweet

WILLY
We do have a very modern marriage
don’t we

COLETTE
We do What do you think of Missy

WILLY
She’s very pleasant But she
perplexes me Words in our language
are either masculine or feminine
There’s no word for Missy

Oh I know one

You seem content for once Isn’t
there something missing

COLETTE
What do you mean

It’s a new level of erotic engagement for

expectantly on a chaise longue A quiet knock on the door

simpering at the foot of the bed

COLETTE
Missy you were married once
weren’t you

MISSY
Yes it was awful We don’t talk
anymore except through the auspices
of lawyers He’s embarrassed by me -
if he was married to me what does
that say about him

COLETTE
It must have been very hard for you
I mean to put on the trousers

MISSY
No it was entirely natural I was a
rather awkward child - if you can
imagine me in pigtails and a dress I
never felt like I belonged Then one
day I tried on my brother’s school
uniform

(MORE )
COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

MISSY (CONTD)

And I knew I was home for the first
time Of course it’s far easier
for me than for women of no means
but I wanted to show that it can be
done I do imagine a time when all
women may wear trousers if that is
their wish

Colette smiles reflecting

MISSY (CONT’D)
And you

COLETTE
What about me

MISSY
Well I dress as a man Willy
dresses you as a schoolgirl

COLETTE
(ironically)
Thank you
(takes a breath)
I do know what I’m doing you know
I’m in on the joke

MISSY
I don’t doubt it But are you
happy

COLETTE

Is anybody happy Willy’s demanding -
yes but he gives me a lot of freedom

MISSY
It’s a long leash he keeps you on
but a leash nevertheless
perhaps you enjoy that

COLETTE
Do you think that’s terribly
wrong

MISSY

No That’s entirely your business But

never mind

COLETTE
What
COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 91

when you have to decide - are you
Claudine or are you Colette

My Dear I’m surprised you didn’t
get arrested Or beaten up

Colette shrugs this off
COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

COLETTE
WillyI’ve was thinking You know
‘Claudine Takes Off’ - why don’t we

publish it under both our names

WILLY
Out of the question Ollendorff
will never agree

COLETTE
Ollendorff or you

WILLY
My dear do you want to the kill the goose
that’s laying the golden Claudines

Colette is exasperated

COLETTE
But there’s little risk Claudine’s
established And many people they
know already or suspect Surely

WILLY
No one knows Unless you’ve been crowing
about it to your lady man friend

COLETTE
Don’t insult Missy

WILLY
I think she is stripping you of your
sense of humourand your common sense

COLETTE
That’s not fair Willy

WILLY
We can’t risk it Especially not with
our present finances We’re dead broke

COLETTE
We’re always broke Yet you gamble and
fill this place with all your antiques

She carries on with the exercises self-absorbed

WILLY
It’s a charming hobby Tetette
but You are not Sarah

it off as high art you’1ll be doing

sake And that would be
scandalous

COLETTE
And when have you ever considered
scandal a bad thing

He’s all for it He comes along to
Wague’s studio with me all the time

The curtain goes up on a set resembling the interior of an
Egyptian tomb — hieroglyphics statues etc

Missy enters the stage woodenly dressed as an
archeologist reading from an old book The crowd ROARS A
shower of coins orange peel and garlic cloves rains on the
stage

Undaunted Missy finds a cartouche on the sarcophagus and
carefully brushes the dust off it

HECKLER
Get a move on you dyke

Then with great effort Missy opens the lid of the
sarcophagus The lights change The orchestra ramps up
And something starts to appear

of evocative movements Missy watches her in stagy wonder

Some audience members are delighted others appalled

A POSH HECKLER
Degenerate Get back to Lesbos

Now the dance is really heating up Colette comes down from
the pedestal and starts to dance Missy joins in framing
Colette’s gyrations with her own eccentric movements

As the crowd starts to boil over Willy’s eyes are shining

At the climax of the dance Colette falls into the
Marquise’s arms Their lips move closer and closer — a huge
GASP comes up from the house Then

THEY KISS

The house EXPLODES People are on their feet yelling and
booing A barrage of food and glasses are thrown onto the
stage smashing around the embracing couple - even a
footstool which Colette narrowly dodges The curtain
falls

But the rioting audience turn on them

his cane keeping them off as he and Meg make their way to the
door Somebody grabs Meg’s hair and she punches him in the
face The whole auditorium is in a state of revolt

Madame Colette what are your
impressions of tonight

COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 99

COLETTE
(firing on all cylinders)
My ‘impressions’ I’m disgusted
These people who threw things are
cowards - if I didn’t get a

because I dodged it

Let it go Colette

There were some gentleman there
who came for a fight We just have

fit of jealous rage he shoves Colette around smashing
dishes and goes to attack the lover

but Wague’s rage just builds He goes to attack the lover
but Colette gets in between them

Wague grabs her collar and TEARS IT ASUNDER REVEALING HER
