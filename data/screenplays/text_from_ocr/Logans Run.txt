PLEASE NOTE THE CRYSTAL WILL BE USED IN THE
LEFT HAND OF ALL CHARACTERS

FADE IN
BEFORE AND DURING TITLES

1 EXT - SKY
NIGHT

The moon and stars are visible but as CAMERA looks down the SCREEN
fills with dark billowing clouds CAMERA moves into the clouds and
just as they blank out the SCREEN a distant shimmer of light
becomes visible Moving toward it the shimmer becomes

2 EXT - DOME OF GLASS - NIGHT

A glowing but not transparent structure stretching off into the
clouds that press it CAMERA continues to move in until the
detailed structural webbing of the dome fills the SCREEN and then
CAMERA MOVES THROUGH IT and we see

3 EXT - THE CITY - DAY

Shining below the dome (which we now see as a series of dome-like
structures standing off without end) -a marvelous crystalline city
of great openness building clusters green plazas fountains
multi-leveled but human scale crisscrossed by the flickering clear
tubes of the MAZE- CARS

4 CLOSER ANGLE - ROOFTOPS
As a MAZE-CAR slides softly to a stop
5 ROOFTOP - THE RUNNER

The hatch opens and a MAN in a hurry leaves the maze-car and runs
swiftly along the rooftop and disappears into an open elevator
which instantly starts to descend

6 INT - RESIDENCE PLAZA - THE ELEVATOR

From a busy courtyard below we watch the elevator slide down from a
great height As it reaches the courtyard the RUNNER darts out
pushes into the crowd

7 OUT
8 WITH THE RUNNER

As he reappears around a corner skirts a brimming pool and makes
for a kind of broad corridor which seems to lead out of the
courtyard He is moving even faster now glancing back as if he
fears pursuit

9 ANOTHER ANGLE -
CORRIDOR

Above at the railing of an oval light well dressed in black and
silver a figure holding an odd looking weapon lazily in one hand
-- and watching It is FRANCIS

10 WITH THE RUNNER

Moving rapidly down the corridor he suddenly stops as if feeling
the presence above He looks up sees the SANDMAN and his face
breaks in terror He wheels frantic screaming runs back into the

hall

11 THE SANDMAN
(FRANCIS)

Vaulting the rail dropping lightly to ground level weapon poised
12 POV
The crowd melting parting to reveal the Runner backed against the

pool People are YELLING shaking their fists terribly excited and
fearful
13 THE SANDMAN

Emotionless Aims Fires

14 THE RUNNER - CLOSE

Seeming to burst aflame in the LENS then slipping BELOW FRAME to
reveal Francis sauntering forward holstering his weapon The crowd
closing in behind him applauding congratulating him

15 THE SANDMAN

Arriving at the pool where the body lies half immersed He leans
over lifts the right hand from the water revealing a palm with a
black flowercrystal shape in it He lets the hand fall back now as
the crowd CHEERS and APPLAUDS him

16 EXTREME CLOSE UP - HAND - IN THE WATER - (INSERT)
Closing in until the crystal fills the SCREEN

MATCH DISSOLVE TO

(TITLES END)

17 CLOSE UP - CRYSTAL - (INSERT)

Clear sparkling flower-like CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal

18 INT - NURSERY CORRIDOR

The crystal is in the hand of a sleeping INFANT who is behind glass
in one of many cubicles Standing outside looking in LOGAN dimly
lit in the soft glow of the cubicle where the sleeping infant
lies swaddled and coccooned in the rosy auto-tender which caters
to the babys every need Faint MUSIC bubbles like distant
laughter

19 out
19xX1 LOGAN

Logan is twenty-five strong virile (yet sensitive) with a kind of
austere grace

He is somewhat manicproudas he peers through the nursery
window into a kind of foam cocoon which cradles THREE SLEEPING
INFANTS Logan is KNOCKING on the soundless glass

LOGAN
Wake upcome on Logan-6
19x2 FRANCIS
entering

FRANCIS (shaking
his head in mild mocking
disbelief)

You are here I couldnt
believe it when they told me
What are you doing

LOGAN (still knocking
on the soundless glass)
Turn this way
(as one of the infants
stirs smiles bubbles)
No nonot youYOU

Francis tries to pull Logan away from the window but Logan is
intent on waking one of the infants

FRANCIS

You shouldve seen me take my
last Runnerperfect

(Logan continues to pound the

soundless glass)

I backed him up against a residence
pool and when he terminatedhis
hand

(breaks off as Logan

is paying no attention)
So now youve seen himwhats
the difference awake or asleep

LOGAN (to infant)
Open your eyes once idiot
(to Francis)
Its not every day that a Sandman
son is born Im telling you
Francis - thats him

FRANCIS
Maybe maybe not Whats the
difference Come on Logan
lets get out of here before
everybody finds out

But Logan isnt moving Francis gets an idea

FRANCIS
Okayyou really want to wake
him up

Francis starts to pry at the Panelknowing it will sound an
ALARM

LOGAN
Hey cut that out

Too late There is a SOUND OF ALARM CHIMES The area in which they
stand is bathed in a violet glow Logan grabs Francis firmly and

stops him from prying at the panel

LOGAN
Now youve done it

The CHIMES STOPbut the glow continues a metallic VOICE is heard

VOICE
Break-in scanners report intrusion

LOGAN
Logan-5Francis-7 authorized duty

quadrant Intrusion accidental

VOICE
Clear Logan-5 and Francis-7

The violet light goes off
FRANCIS (with affection
to Logan)

Had enough

LOGAN (looking at the infant)
Even the alarm didnt wake him

As Francis starts out
LOGAN (one last look
joining Francis)
All right FrancisIm with you
They move off down the corridorthe lights behind them DIMMING as
they pass cubicles suffused with soft pink light CHILDREN
automatically tended

CHIMESsoft A lullaby and a soothing impersonal VOICE

VOICE
Sleep timego to sleep
Sleeping time little ones

As they exit NurseryLogan stops and takes one final look
backward

FRANCIS
You need a lift Lets go
to Arcade and celebrate
(teasing tone)
your alert successorLogan-6

LOGAN
Has anyone ever broken in to
where the babies are

FRANCIS
(putting a card key into a door
which opens soundlessly)
Not in my time

They move through the door which closes
20 EXT - MAZE STATION - NIGHT

They are now on a kind of enclosed platform with widely spaced
doorways each glowing faintly They pause waiting

FRANCIS (peering
at Logan curiously)
Why

LOGAN
just wonderedwhat happens

FRANCIS (shrugs)
Dunnoflameout maybe Whatever
happens you can bet its final
But who would want to find out

One of the doorways brightens and the word ARCADE appears on it
The two men move to the spot as a maze-car stops They enter it
through the doorway which dims behind them as the maze-car WHOOSHES

softly off into a kind of twilight
21 INT - MAZE-CAR - LOGAN AND FRANCIS

The door slides shut They sink into seat forms which yield to them
They move off
22 EXT - MAZE- CAR

Moving through the city at terrific speed Giving us glimpses of the
city as it goes slowing finally as we see

23 THE CITY - FEATURING ARCADE

Brightly lit garish We get only a glimpse as the maze-car
disappears into a tunnel

24 MAZE-CAR STATION - ARCADE

As the maze-car stops opens and Logan and Francis exit into a
gathering CROWD

25 FULL SHOT - ARCADE

Glittering crowded Throngs of people moving on many levels some
walking some on moving platforms Its The Great White Way Luna

Park -- you name it Gaudy booths and entrances featuring every
delight -- too much to take in at a glance
26 WITH LOGAN AND FRANCIS

As they thread their way through a crowd which admires them when it
notices them across halls and up moving platforms the good-natured
argument continuing

LOGAN
but you dont know you Just
say what everyone says One for
one One for one

FRANCIS
Well why no Thats exactly how
everything works How else could
the city stay in balance -You have
a better idea

LOGAN (laughs)
No but at least I wonder sometimes --
instead of doing that one for one song
of yours You sound like a sleepteacher
With a stuck tape

FRANCIS
Well the minute you get a better
idea you can stop wondering
(beat)
You know Logan -- you wonder
a lot Too much for a Sandman
They are passing the facade of a Relive Shop The signs urging people
to RELIVE YOUR MOST PRECIOUS MEMORIES DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN
REFRESH AND RENEW ANYTIME

As they cross the entrance two men come out grinning broadly
falling into step just ahead of Logan and Francis Then one of the
men stops abruptly almost colliding with them He mumbles an
apology and starts back to RELIVE

As he disappears into the RELIVE SHOP his friend shrugs cheerfully
to Logan and Francis and moves on

27 ARCADE - ANOTHER ANGLE - NEW YOU

They are moving past a shop called NEW YOU 483 when a man comes
cannonading out thrilled and excited He rushes over to a pretty
young woman who has been eying Logan and Francis plants himself in
front of her with his hands framing his face

MAN
Well How do you like it

WOMAN (critically)
I dont know The cheeks maybe
look a little -

MAN
Cheeks Cheeks Right Too much
you think

WOMAN
Too little

MAN
Too little

(gestures)

Too little Okay wait for me

And he darts back into NEW YOU 483 The woman shrugs glances
around smiles and goes off with a passer-by

28 ARCADE - ANOTHER ANGLE - LOVE SHOP

Signs promising LOVE FULFILLMENT RARE DELIGHTS People streaming
in and out A woman comes out looking glazed breathing
yesyes As she passes CAMERA Logan and Francis emerge from
the crowd and CAMERA moves with them

LOGAN
Did you ever see Francis-8
FRANCIS (shaking his head)
I never even visited Nursery before
tonight
(beat)
When you wonder it slows you up --
you know

They are now passing the facade of HALLUCIMILL where the signs
promise LIFT OFF CRAZY LIFT SUPER LIFThere the people going
in are simply excited but the ones coming out are clearly stoned
out of their minds

FRANCIS
I dont know what makes you so curious
You have any idea who his seed-mother was

LOGAN (quickly)
Of course not I m curious not sick
(laughs)

The crowd is growing denser funneling into a kind of passageway
Logan and Francis are swallowed up in the group

29 FULL SHOT - ARCADE GREAT HALL

An immense room into which the streams of people coming from the
entertainment area are mingling There is a general air of
anticipation stirring the crowd as CAMERA singles out Logan and
Francis entering waving to friends CAMERA closes in on them just
as they reach a beautiful woman who is obviously pleased to see
Francis They embrace and as they break

FRANCIS
and thats my friend Logan
(as she acknowledges
the introduction)
Were celebrating his next in line
Carousel - Arcade - who knows
Want to come along

WOMAN (smiles shakes her
head)
Only if I make it to the top of
Carousel
(she holds up her hand)
Thirty -- and the big spin

In her palm the crystal blinks red black Francis nods gives her
a half-squeeze

FRANCIS
Youre thirty -- already I always
thought I was older than you -
(beat)
Well give it a good try

WOMAN (pleasantly)
You know I always have

Another beautiful WOMAN joins them

2ND WOMAN (to the first)
Sorry I wont be at Carousel tonight
Its my Love-Shop turn

WOMAN
Thats all right Happy turn

2ND WOMAN
Youll renew Ive got a feeling

WOMAN (smiles)
So do Ibut if I dont at least Ill
have the ultimate thrill Id almost
rather have that than renew

2ND WOMAN
I feel the same way Sometimes I think
Im not even going to try and renew when
my time comes But -- thats three years away
So long

The 2nd Woman walks away

FRANCIS (after a beat
to first Woman)
Its been nice

WOMAN
Um-huh

They look briefly and then she turns away Francis takes Logans arm
and they move off

FRANCIS
I guess you never had her

Logan shakes his head

FRANCIS
You missed something special

LOGAN
Wellyou cant have them all
LOGAN AND FRANCIS
(together its an old joke)
But you can try

They laugh but the laughter is broken as a trio of youngsters
moving with erratic speed of lightning smashes between them
almost knocking Francis over He reels Logan catches him and they
recover in time to see the trio rip wildly through the crowd
knocking people down screaming with shrill joy as they disappear

FRANCIS
The damned Yellows are getting out
of hand Those three ought to be in
Cathedral No business scrambling in
Arcade

LOGAN (laughs
cuffs Francis arm)
What an old old man youre getting
to be Francis Werent you ever a
Yellow I bet you were even wilder
than -
(he breaks off as the lights
in the Great Hall dim)
-- come on Sandman

The two of them start to move to the far end of the Great Hall

30 FULL SHOT - GREAT HALL

As everyone begins to move to the far end where great curtains
have parted to reveal

31 ARCADE GREAT HALL - CAROUSEL ENTRANCE

AC the far end of the hall where the throng is a huge crystal
design ornaments an entrance The crystal is red and pulsing
rhythmically to the accompaniment of a deep and thrilling TONE As
we move toward it with Logan and Francis the TONE deepens the
great pulse takes on a hypnotic quality

32 WITH LOGAN AND FRANCIS

In the crowd they overtake a fellow Sandman DANIEL and fall in
step with him When they speak now their voices are hushed

LOGAN
You should have been with us in Nursery

Daniel Im positive I recognized him -

FRANCIS (hustling
Logan)
Come on I dont want to miss the
filing-in Therell be some I know
tonight I think

DANIEL (glances at his
own red crystal nods)
Yes Me too You know were
both on Monitor tonight

FRANCIS
Damn Thats right Just when I
feel like an ALL OUT BLAST in
Arcade

LOGAN
Want me to take your shift Im
feeling restless anyway

Francis glances at him exchanges a look with Daniel They vanish
into the throng passing under the great crystal turn the corner and
we see

33 FULL SHOT - CAROUSEL

framed in a huge corridor we see a steep-sided arena dropping down
to a shadowy center which even now pulsates and flickers in
changing dimensions but always maintaining the jewel- flower
shape There is one entrance into the center -- a kind of ramp from
below the seats leading directly into the mysterious bowl --

Just now the seats are filling and the sense of expectation builds
People sit and immediately crane their necks waiting

34 ANOTHER ANGLE

Featuring Logan and Francis as they find places in the arena Like
the others they crane upward As they do Logan gestures at a
number of pretty girls who are just being seated

LOGAN
Now theres a few who could have been
his seed-mother

FRANCIS
Only a few Youre just not trying

35-36 out
37 PANNING THE CROWD

As the seats fill the excitement builds Suddenly the lights begin
to dim and dim
SOUND A kind of collective sigh breathing in unison
38 OUT
38X1 ANGLE THE TIER BELOW THE SEATS

Suddenly visible the LASTDAY GROUP Their arms are upraised and in
each palm the crystal blinks red-black red-black

39 THE CROWD
Transfixed gripped with a religious fervor
40 LASTDAY GROUP

Hands still raised filing slowly into the mysterious well of
Carousel

41 CROWD

Tense beginning nervous APPLAUSE here and there

42 CAROUSEL

As the last one enters beginning to glow and as it does the bowl
slowly puts out leaves like some great plant enfolding and hiding
the people within a series of translucent petals As the Last one
enfolds them the Light intensifies the exterior surfaces seeming to
shift as if a kind of motion was beginning inside it

43 CROWD

Visible in the growing Light from Carousel -gripped with passion and
excitement APPLAUDING gesturing as they see

44 CAROUSEL

Moving bands of light seeming to spiral upward Like a contained
aurora as the Carousel picks up speed

45 LOGAN

Caught up in it Like the rest

46 CAROUSEL

Beginning to blur with its own speed Through the shifting
spiraling curtain of light we see bodies moving in a kind of

weightlessness always struggling to move higher

Follow a shadowy form as it moves twists through other writhing
shadows -- upward upward Suddenly the form is spread-eagled and
in a moment it is sharply outlined against the swirling canopy and

then -- a searing flash And it is gone
SOUND Crowd in a frenzy -- SCREAMING
47 FULL ANGLE - THE BLEACHER CROWD - FAVORING LOGAN

Standing SCREAMING their cheers as

48 FULL SHOT - UP AT CAROUSEL

High reaching downward out of the shadows beneath the dome
fringing intersecting rainbow bands appear looping the swirling
upper Carousel like Saturns rings Now we see figures reaching
outward toward themreaching and missing and falling -downward
against the curtain and the flash of extinction

49 MEDIUM ANGLE - A MAN

SCREAMING fulfilled

56 OUT

57 FULL ANGLE - THE CAROUSEL

Other figures move to the topmost levelstraining for the rainbow

58 CLOSE ON - LOGAN AND FRANCIS

As the SCREAMING goes on in the bg of the SHUT we hear a

BUZZING noise Logan reaches into a pocket and takes out a small
dark plastic box

Logan looks at the box On it we see
MAN RELIVE STORE 14

LOGAN
(to Francis)
Looks like Im working

Francis stands

LOGAN
Who invited you

FRANCIS
Im in my party mood

Logan smiles and the CAMERA PANS them rushing out of the
bleachers

They make their way into the hall
Logan takes out the small plastic box We can tell from his face

that he is disappointeduntil a faint BEEPING SOUND emanates from
the box
Francis watches as Logan wheels in one direction the beeping
stops He turns in another direction again there is no beeping

As Logan turns in a third directionthe BEEPING commences
Logan and Francis move swiftly in that direction and the BEEPING
GROWS LOUDERAND LOUDERuntil Logan and Francis see

mans face rests it on his forehead

63X5 INSERT TRANSCEIVER READOUT
The words appear IDENT AFFIRMNEW YOU 483 ALTERATION

63X6 LOGAN

Scowls for a moment then shrugs He takes out a small flat pouch
and methodically strips from the body its few personal things
stuffs them into the pouch Then his eye is caught by the mans
right hand clenched Logan opens it A metal ankh on a bit of
chain It means nothing to Logan who stuffs it into the pouch and
closes it Now again he fiddles with the transceiver speaks into it
softly

LOGAN
Runner terminated 031
(a beat)
Ready for cleanup

Done with his job he rises to face Francis
LOGAN
(smiling)

That was a great shot you made

FRANCIS
Yes
(beat)
But you look a little rusty to me --
what were you doing wondering

Logan shrugs Hes not sure himself Together they walk off down the
hall passing CAMERA

63X7 ANOTHER ANGLE

We see in the distance a pair of Stickmen descending into the hall
riding through the air on their odd vehicles passing overhead then
descending One hovers not far away as the other comes down hangs a
few feet over the body

63X8 1ST STICKMAN AND BODY

The driver makes sure hes in position then presses a button on one
of the arms of the vehicle There is a broad spray of vapor from the
bottom which covers the corpse

63x9 CORPSE (INSERT)

It turns to crystals which sag away from the human form as a sand
sculpture erodes when its dry

63X10 1ST STICKMAN CLOSE ON HEAP OF CRYSTALS

Satisfied he revs his machine and it rises smoothly out of the
SHOT As it leaves the second machine moves down and into its
place

63X11 2ND STICKMAN

Glances at the crystals maneuvers into position presses his
buttons

63X12 CLOSER ANGLE - THE CRYSTALS STICKMAN

Sucked up into the machine as it hovers As the floor is once again
bare the 2nd Stickman revs slightly and his machine pulls up and
away

63X13 ANOTHER ANGLE

As the Stickmen move up and out we see the exhilarated crowd
beginning to pour out of Carousel

63X14 LOGAN AND FRANCIS - ARCADE

Descending from the top level -- not much of a crowd Francis is
gesturing toward the Hallucimill
FRANCIS
-Well I think youre getting stale
You need old Lucey--Go on Gee the whole
burn--try the new psycho-lift-they tell
me it turns you inside out

He shoves Logan in that direction and continues on down

FRANCIS
(calling after him)
Ill look for you here when Im off--

And he is gone

63X15 LOGAN

waves smiling then turns to the Hallucimill
63X16 POV - HALLUCIMILL EXT

Crazy man

63X17 BACK TO LOGAN

Hesitates as a COUPLE push past him gleefully on their way He
looks and we see

63X18 POV - ARCADE UPPER LEVELS

The people from Carousel starting to pour in loud happy ready for
more fun

63X19 LOGAN
Not with it He turns and starts making his way downwards towards
the exit

63X20 LOGANS APARTMENT

As he enters Idle restless He crosses to a sideboard--makes
himself a drink sips doesnt like it Gets rid of it makes
another He fiddles with things a game--sits gets up Now he is
beginning to feel the drink Takes another belt smiles Now he goes
over to a tall wall recess flanked by a console with many dials

63X21 AT THE WALL RECESS
As Logan dials blurred and smoky images appear in the recess--a

slow protoplasmic eddying in many colors He tunes it in and the
figure of a smiling young man appears--bejeweled lustrous willing

63X22 LOGAN AT THE CONSOLE
Bored as Mastroianni turns the dial again and the young man
dissolves He dials again and now a beautiful young woman takes
shape It is Jessica

63X23 JESSICA AND LOGAN

Still in the recess she makes no gesture of interest no smile
Around her neck from a collar a dangling ankh It catches Logans
eye He smiles clicks another dial and she becomes real He reaches
out a hand and leads her out into the room

64 LOGAN AND JESSICA

As Jessica turns to him Logan moves in strongly and embraces her-
but to his surprise she resists Logan still holding her loosely
is amused and surprised

LOGAN
Whats wrong Available

JESSICA
(breaking away gently)
Please No

She backs away almost apologetically Logan follows smiling

LOGAN
Please no
(noting that she looks trapped
he understands)
You mean not here--thats it
Youre a private Available but
particular
(he is moving in on her
as he speaks she retreating
which amuses him)

(a beat)

JESSICA

LOGAN
You shouldnt even think such things
(smiles)
And you picked a strange person to
say them to -

JESSICA
I suppose But what if you want
to live

LOGAN
So Do what everyone does Try
like hell for renewal

Logan stretches out his right hand We see a red flower crystal
embedded and centered in his right palm It is exactly the same
shape that we have seen in black in the palm of the dead runner

LOGAN
When this turns blackthats it
(laughs)
If for any reason you want to be 31
you have the same chance as everyone
elseCarrousel

Logan takes his gun and points it at her

LOGAN (playfully)
But if youre one of the misfits
thats where I come in

JESSICA (somewhat
frightened)
I didnt say that I would run
I Just

LOGAN (interrupting
turning over her palm)
Are you a 5 or a 6
(we see a green crystal)

JESSICA
Six I go red next year

LOGAN
Youre years away I dont know
why youre thinking of these things
much less talking about them
(offering Jessica the gun)
Want to try
Jessica shakes her head Logan looks at Jessica carefullyin an

admiring sexual wayfrom her toes to her headbriefly noticing
(in the process) chat she is wearing an identical piece of jewelry
that he has taken off the dead runneraround her neck

LOGAN
What Quad do you live in

JESSICA

LOGAN (softly)
Youre sure you dont want to try

Jessica nods

LOGAN
Its nice to know you can nod

Jessica smiles

LOGAN
Its nice co know you can do that
too

Suddenly Francis and two dishevel led young WOMEN burst in and come
laughing toward Logan and Jessica Stoned hilarious they crowd
around Logan one of them embracing him In the wild hilarity
Jessica slips away and Logan seeing her go makes a vain effort
after her Francis notices laughs Amid the noise he shouts to
Logan

FRANCIS
These are for me -- youve got your
own
(looking after Jessica)
She must have been something--

At Logans expression he roars with laughter Francis picks up an
atomizer and hurls it at the ceiling where it shatters and a great
pink cloud settles over them all

64X1 EXT - SAND MAN HQ

A frowning structure of dark stone and mirrored copper fronted by
broad steps Logan and Francis are climbing the steps as a SANDMAN
is coming out His uniform is in tatters They greet one
anotherthen

LOGAN
What happened to you
SANDMAN (embarrassed)
I lost a Runner in Cathedral

LOGAN
How come

SANDMAN
Ran into some Cubs I couldnt manage
(as they stare)
One of them cut me bad
(extends his arm and moves
a finger from his shoulder to
his wrist)
all the way down

FRANCIS
(with anger)
CUBS

SANDMAN (shrug)
On my way to the New You for repairs

69 INT - SANDMAN HQ - DEBRIEFING AREA

Black door opens revealing Logan and Francis who now enter a mammoth
room As they walk they pass FOUR GIANT LIFECLOCKSWHITE
YELLOW GREEN AND RED

Each LIFECLOCK pulses out the moments of every person alive in the
city governing everyones crystal changes automatically shifting to
the next LIFECLOCK when the time comes

There are no humans
Francis walks over to a circular table at the end of the room

above which is a circular overhang There is a groovethe shape of
a palm crystal on one part of the circular table

Francis takes out the plastic bag which contains the contents of the
dead Runners pockets and starts putting the contents on the table
(These contents are the ones from the Runner Francis has killed at
the beginning of the film)

The moment the first item touches the tableit activates a scanner
on the overhang above

Francis stands alongside the tablehis attitude is very matter-of
fact He has been through this procedure many many times

He touches his head (the hangover)and Logan smiles Moments
laterthe scanner stopsthe word

IDENTIFY

appears on a SCREEN Francis places his palm into the groove
and the words

CLEAR
FRANCIS-7

appear on the SCREEN
FRANCIS
See you in the hydrotoner

Logan nods

Francis exits as Logan places the contents of a plastic bag with the
items he has taken off the Runner who jumped to his death Among
them is the odd-shaped piece of jewelry

Logan is standing nonchalantlyas the scanner moves over the
itemswaiting to be quickly identified and cleared as Francis was
earlier

The scanner continues scanning

Logan starts becoming impatientbut the scanning goes on and on
and on

NowLogan is clearly puzzledit has neverever taken anything
remotely resembling this length of time

Suddenly directly before himon the SCREEN the word
PROBABILITY

blinks on and offon and offcatching Logans attention As
Logan turns toward the SCREENthe scanner stops moving The word
PROBABILITY blinks off and is replaced by the word

APPROACH

We can tell from Logans expression as he walks to the corner
that he has never seen this before

Logan sits in a chair in the area facing the SCREEN There is a
stellar groove (that we have seen on the Table) the shape of a palm
crystalglowing on an arm of the chair

The word on the SCREEN is now
IDENTIFY

Logan places his right palm with the flower crystal into the groove
We hear a HUMMING NOISEthen The piece of jade Jewelry appears
on the SCREEN and below the piece of jewelry the following words

Question My Life--

Before the startled Logan can finishhe feels a shock of pain and
his hand is immobile Logan stares at the back of his hand as if it
wasnt his His forehead shines with sweat

Now the entire area including the chair and the screen begins to
glow bright red The glowing becomes so bright that Logan is forced
to close his eyes

As the glow subsidesLogan looks at his right hand The red flower
crystal in his palm is blinking He stares at it fascinated
fearful

LOGAN
Question

(urgent tone)
Am I still six Red
The words on the SCREEN read

LOGAN (standing)
I know that but I had four more years
(extending the blinking palm)
This means ten days to Lastday
Of course I will get the four years
back wont I

The words on the SCREEN read
TAKE OBJECT WITH YOU

LOGAN (very urgent)
Question Do I get my four years back

Too late The SCREEN is BLANK For a moment his lips part as if to
say something more but he changes his mind turns away

Now Logan walks over to the table and removes the ankh Almost
automatically he starts moving his hand toward the groovebut the
SCREEN already has the words

CLEAR LOGAN-5

Logan looks at it - then

The CAMERA PANS Logan out of the mammoth room past the GIANT

so as to intersect with Logan and Jessica where the crowd is
thickest streams coming together to move to a higher level

mans hands

94X14 LOGAN AND JESSICA

Suddenly she stops He comes round facing as people eddy by them
Logan looks at her searchingly

LOGAN
Tell me Jessica

Behind him the two men move in The man with the garrote raises his
hands One more step Logan senses something half-turns just as
we hear a familiar urgent SOUND--the sound of his transceiver
Behind him the man hesitates drops his hands Logan takes the
transceiver from his belt and moves out of the crowd to the side
Jessica with him Now he bends to read the message and Jessica
cranes her head to see too

94X15 READY ROOM - FRANCIS AND SANDMEN

LOGAN
Have you ever been through Cathedral
Jessica shakes her head

LOGAN
Theyre like beasts Wild

JESSICA
Maybe theyre angry because theyre

grown in meccano-breeders

LOGAN (interrupting

grimacing)
Instead of what Nine months inside a
woman

(ugh)

Were all raised the same but most of
us dont become cubs in Cathedral

JESSICA
Some people say children need human
mothering

LOGAN

Insane Nurseries are better than any
mother could be

JESSICA

Havent you ever wondered what your

JESSICA

(another beat)
What would you like to relive Logan

LOGAN (smiling)
Lets see - how long has it been
As Jessica turns her headlooking somewhat guilty the maze-car
slides to a stop

A warning light pulses on the cars console and a RECORDED VOICE
speaks before the hatch opens

VOICE
Attention passengers Cathedral
Station is a personal risk area
Persons with business are warned
to be careful

121X1 EXT - MAZE-CAR - CATHEDRAL STATION

Now the hatch opens They step out Logan first Jessica timidly
looking around Behind them the hatch closes the maze-car sighs
away into the distance

JESSICA
Ive never been in this quadrant
(looks off)
Is that Arcade off there

There are standing on the maze-car platform -- a high overlook like
an elevated station

121X2 POV - THE CITY BEYOND THE WALLS OF CATHEDRAL
Arcade shining like distant fireworks
122 EXT - MAZE-CAR M PLATFORM - CATHEDRAL

Below them a narrow sharply angled concrete canyon buttressed
walls rising featureless The look of an old fortress blank dim
and cool Still visible over an opening the chiseled legend
Cathedral Plaza--2025 AD--Skidmore Rosenfelt Hennesy
architects

Jessica shivers looking around her Logan takes her arm and they
descend into the canyon move toward the wall Their footsteps the
only SOUND

LOGAN
Let me go first Sometimes theyre
waiting just inside there--to rush
you when it opens

LOGAN
Quickly now--

He helps her through the narrow opening--the portals walls are very
thick They turn abruptly and see

INT - WALL - DAZZLE CHAMBER

A room of angled reflecting surfaces At one end a jagged corridor

also mirrored

leads away The zigzag angled effect creates an

absolute confusion of images but Logan leads her unhesitatingly
across the chamber to the corridor Jessica hangs back momentarily

certain shes

about to smash into something

LOGAN (guiding her)
Just follow--no matter how it seems

JESSICA (doing her
best)
But what is this--why

LOGAN (as they enter
the corridor)
The Cubs When theyre flying on muscle
theres no way to catch up Without the
dazzle theyd just go past us--
(gesture)
too fast

JESSICA
Muscle I dont know that one

Logan is leading her down the zigzag corridor Its stop and go--a
fun house in which you can get hurt

LOGAN

Its unauthorized No good for any-
one over thirteen anyhow--shakes you
to pieces--speeds everything up to a
blur--

(he is amused)
you can see what happens when some
flying Cub tries to go through this
on muscle--splat

Jessica reactsto what Logan has saidthen A moment later

ANOTHER ANGLE

As they approach the end of the corridor a small FIGURE in a
tattered garment approaches them She stops SINGING as she sees
Logan and Jessica

JESSICA (gently)
Dont be afraid

We see that it is a little GIRL of seven Her face is grimy and hair
is tangled

JESSICA
Whats your name

MARY
Im Mary 2

JESSICA

Where do you live Mary

MARY
Here

JESSICA
Why arent you in Nursery

MARY
Im very smart

JESSICA
When do you go up

MARY

I never go upstairs Youre a
nice old lady

As soon as she finishes her last sentence Mary grabs at Jessicas
clothingtearing a pin (piece of Jewelry) offand running away
swiftly
As Jessica instinctively starts after herLogan holds her back
LOGAN
(shaking his head)

Not here Might be a decoy
Cautiously Logan and Jessica exit from the wall stepping out into-
125 EXT - CATHEDRAL ITSELF

An area of rubble and dilapidated buildings

Logan crouches holding the transceiver and fanning the area
listening

SOUND a soft beeping which abruptly grows louder and holds steady

Logan gestures to Jessica to follow him and moves carefully in the
direction of the BEEPING quartering occasionally like a hunting
dog Coming up to an angle of wall he stops flicks the sound off
puts the machine back onto his belt He gestures to Jessica to stand

still then he straightens steps out calls

LOGAN
Runner

Silence Jessica involuntarily moves to him and as she does the
Runner moves from behind an upright and stands- The figure is
shadowed the arms out palms facing in a kind of gesture of
surrender In the Runners left hand the tiny red crystal pulses on
and off The Runner is a woman

There is an instant of frozen confrontation and then suddenly
Jessica gasps grasping at him

As Logan whirls
125xX1 ANOTHER ANGLE

Suddenly from everywhere out of the shadows a pack of snarling
Cubs materializes--moving with blinding speed At their appearance
the Runner whirls and races off into the dark shadows Logan makes a
futile gesture after her then turns to face the Cubs

A strutting feral-faced fourteen or fifteen year old heads the
pack dressed in fierce-looking tatters and hung with rip-off
trophies He gestures to one of his followers to stand still

BILLY
(speaking of the Runner)
Dont worry about her Well have that
one later Right now I think weve got
a Runner and his pairup And what a Runner

The CAMERA PANS the other Cubsmean filthy

A VOICE
Were going to have ourselves a time
we are Right Billy

There is a chilling laughter of agreement from the rest

LOGAN
Im a Sandman

BILLY
I cut up a Sandman yesterday They
said Id never get himbut I cut
him up good I did

LOGAN (firm tone)
I feel sorry for you boy
Some murmuring as the pack watches their leader

BILLY
For me Better feel sorry for your-
self Sandman

LOGAN
No for you How old are you Billy

Billy is silent

LOGAN

Fourteen Fifteen Your days are running
out How long can you last A year Six
months

(he points to the yellow

flower in Billys palm)
What happens when youre sixteen and
you go green

BILLY (lashing out)
Nothing will happen I make the
rules as I go Cubs do what I say
Always have Always will I got
Cathedral and Ill never let go

LOGAN

No cubs over fifteen Billy Ever
heard of a cub with a green flower
Youll leave Cathedral then Billy
when youre on green because they
wont let a green stay here

(slightest beat)
If you try to stay the young ones will
gut-rip you apart

BILLY
Shut up Shut up your damn mouth

Logan falls back into a fighting crouchbut before he can strike a
blowhe is grabbed and slammed against the wall of an abandoned
building

ANOTHER VOICE
Let him suck Muscle Thatll shut
his mouth Lets watch him shake
himself to death

We see the Cubs take out drugpads They squeeze the pads and inhale
the Muscle At once their movements become blurringly rapid They
take menacing positions - some leaping overhead
A VOICE
Give him some Muscle

Like lightning they change positions and flash around Logan and
Jessica

126 CLOSE ON - JESSICA
Watchingterrified

127 CLOSE ON - LOGAN

Being held against the wall by Cubs as

ANOTHER VOICE
Shake him to death

A VOICE
Kill him

128 ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING BILLY
moving a drugpad against Logans face

Logan is holding his breathdesperately trying not to breathe the
Muscle directly from the pad into his system

BILLY (chilling laugh)
Hes trying to hold his breath

As Billy presses the pad tighter against Logans face

With all his might Logan wrenches his arms loose drops to the
ground and pulls out his gun

He fires and fire girdles a pillarand they start to back away

BILLY
We can rush himwe can take
can take him again we can

The pack hesitatesstops backing away

LOGAN
(moving the gun slowly
back and forth)
All right How many of you want this to
be Lastday

The pack moves back againand disperses leaving Billy facing
Logan alone
LOGAN
Come on Billycome onyou cut
a Sandman didnt you

Logan tucks the gun back into his waist

LOGAN
Come on Billycut meCome on

After a beat Billy turns and runs away

Logan comforts the shivering Jessica for a moment then takes out the
small box from his pocket and turns ituntil it starts BEEPING

The CAMERA PANS Logan and Jessicafollowing the SOUND

They move over the rubbleand cautiously around abandoned
buildings

We HEAR A SCREAMand HEAR the Cubs whove only obviously found and
attacked someone The SOUND is coming from a different direction
than where the beeping is coming from

LOGAN
(shaking his head)
Theyve got someone else Why would
anybody come here

Jessica shudders as the scream dies abruptly
The BEEPING is now very loud

Logan homes in on an abandoned building enters crosses swiftly to
a door inside and kicks it down

We SEE the Runner The WOMAN cringing expecting death
129 FULL SHOT - LOGAN AND THE WOMAN

the barrel and smiles The is Logans job

LOGAN (quietly)
Dont be afraid--

Before Logan can continuethe Womanwho is now wild-eyed and
hysterical lunges at Loganand starts grappling with him

WOMAN
Ill kill you Ill kill you

After Logan pushes her awayand she falls down

LOGAN (breathing hard)
Im not going to hurt you

Slowly she rises
Logan takes out the ankh

LOGAN
Sanctuary Anything

Logan reaches into his pocket and takes out a small round
objectthe size of a large marble

LOGAN
If they find you throw this hard
enough to break it Then hold your
breath till you get awayIts
blind gas

Her reaction is blank then with desperate ferocity she attacks
Logan again

During the course of the struggle Logan subdues her again

Jessica enters bends over the near-crazed Runner as Logan holds
her Eyeing him the woman stands and takes the small round

objectshe appears somewhat bewildered as Logan and Jessica move
off

137 ANOTHER ANGLE - OVERLOOKING CATHEDRAL ENTRANCE

The Second and Third Menvery close to the maze-car platform
peering into the darkness and seeing Logan and Jessica emerge onto
the maze-car platform We can tell from the way the two men look at
one another that they believe Logan has fired the shot they have
heard

They hide from the approaching Logan and Jessica

Now he takes out the items of the dead woman Runner and places them
on the scanning table

An ALARM SOUNDS and the word
REJECT
flashes on and off on the SCREEN

Sandmen come running into the Area

SANDMAN
What happened
Francis hesitatesthenquickly as if changing his mind
taking the items off the table
FRANCIS
Can you beat itIve got the damn
wrong bag
SANDMAN
You ought to put yourself on reliefcall
Francis
FRANCIS (starting out)
Yeah
140 EXT - NEW YOU 483 - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA

as they enter NEW YOU 483 they are being watched by
141 MED ANGLE - THE SECOND AND THIRD MEN

A safe distance behind
142 INT - NEW YOU 483

The waiting room has many mirrorswhere customers male and
femaleare checking their faces (and bodies)

There are also various photographs on the walls suggestions for
changes to foreheads eyes cheeks lips etcetera The chatty
informality is very much like people in a beauty parlor or barber
shop

There is a RECEPTIONIST seated behind a desk in a corner

Logan and Jessica walk up to the desk

The receptionist looks at Loganignoring Jessica

RECEPTIONIST
Hello Sandman

LOGAN

Logan nods impatient - he knows someones watching

RECEPTIONIST

Logan and Jessica walk to one of the chairs in the waiting area and
sit down next to an attractive WOMAN

WOMAN CUSTOMER

HOLLY

Logan and Jessica stand They follow Holly into a large shining
stainless steel room where we see

143 MED ANGLE - DOC

who looks about twenty-one years old exchanges a pointed look with
Jessica

boc
Its a real privilege Sandman

LOGAN

I thought youd be older I ex-
pected a Red

DOC (showing his palm
the flower crystal is Red)
LOGAN
Your own work

DOC (with pride)
And I did it myself right on there

144 FULL - ANGLE - THE SURGICAL APPARATUS
Aesculaptor Mark III -- the latest in servo-surgical designs
Completely self-contained -- tilt-bed cryojector services embedded

in the platform The Mark IIIs laser heads are integrated into the
whole cocoon swiveled and gimbaled so as to be able to focus any of
the surgical beams in microscopic delicacy or wide-bladed scraping

The machine vaguely resembles an enormously complicated x-ray table
on an angle -- the great slotted laser heads overhanging it and
Integral with it From the cryonic receptor base there is a steady
exhalation of cold -- the vapor seeping steadily downwards blurring
the endlessly looped and tangled tubes and wires and containers
Which join in solid state circuitry so that any random or
involuntary twitch of a patient will be instantly compensated by an

equivalent move of the laser head -- keeping the focus precise
At one end -- where the halves of the Mark III join is n console of
switches and dials -- lights nod servo-recorders which control the

operation from the first injection of cold to the final healing
vacuum drafts and scar burnishing With the air of a magician
demonstrating Doc goes to the console and flips switches Instantly
the table responds -- the platform tilting the crab-like laser arms
descending flexing -- small vapor jets oozing as the beams slash
harmlessly across the table Beaming Doc turns it off and the whole
apparatus subsides

boc
I designed it myself
(slightest beat)
Whatll it be a face job or
a full-body job

LOGAN
Just the face

boc
FineHolly will get you ready

Youre in good hands believe me
Holly comes forward and unbuttons the collar on Logans tunic

As Holly brushes her fingertips lightly down Logans arms
Doc
Holly works here because she gets a
lift out of watching the Table
(smiles)
and other things Ill be back ina
minute

HOLLY
Hes going to sterilize himself

LOGAN
Do I have to undress

HOLLY
Not for your face

Logan follows Holly to the Table (Jessica remains behind with Doc
who speaks to her with soft urgency)

Doc
You shouldnt have brought him here

JESSICA
I didnt bring him -- whats
the difference Hes blinking
He wants to run

Doc
Run Hes a Sandman

JESSICA
I tell you hes running I know

Doc
MaybeMaybe But I wish hed
gone somewhere else
(a beat a shrug)
All right He gets a face

144x1 THE SURGICAL TABLE - LOGAN AND HOLLY
Logan lies down

The Table ripplesaccepting his weight prisoning and positioning
him

HOLLY
(leaning - close to
Logan)
I like dark hair Have him give you
dark hair
DOCS VOICE
All set

HOLLY
Um huh Would you take a picture
of him Doc Id like you to give
his face to somebody else

DOC
Why not

Doc pushes a buttonthere is a tiny FLASH

Doc
Do you have anything special in mind

LOGAN
I dont careJust get it over

DOC (smiling)
Hurryhurryhurry

HOLLY (whispering)
Dark hair

LOGAN
Hollyd like dark hair

boc

Hollyd like a lot of things
(studying Logans face)

We can start by narrowing the

cheekbones

Doc presses buttons on the control board Jessica who is standing
next to Doc is slightly startled as the Table begins to HUMas a
pair of laser beams separate themselves from the overhead cluster
and extend toward Logan forming inner cones as they approach

CryoJector needles start to close in on them nearing their faces
and shoulders slowlythe visible cold streaming off the points

A vibrobeam begins to KEEN

SOUND An insistent chiming

Doc hears the sound and turns with the martyred air of a man whos
been called to the phone too many times He turns to a phone-like

apparatus nearby shifting the table into neutral as he turns The
table and the laser heads stop moving
Doc
(as if speaking on a phone)
Hello
(listening)
Yes
(listening)
Yes they are
(listening his expression
changing)
Done

Doc turns back to the console pausing to stare intently at Logan
then up at the brightly smiling Holly Something in his look
registers and Hollys smile fades Now Doc engages the machine
again

boc
Pay attention Sandman Im
proud of this machine

As he speaks he presses and an arm sweeps downward and into position
near Logans face It pauses as

Doc
With this one theres no waiting
for scar burnishing Its all in
onewatch now

The laser arm sweeps across Logans forehead and cheeks leaving a
bright trail of blood as

Doc
But heres the improvement Instant
healing---before you feel a thing
Watch now

Doc pushes a special button and the arm sweeps back along the track
spraying healing fluid Magically the blood vanishes and the skin is
moist and whole

144x2 THE SURGICAL TABLE - LOGAN

His face tense--he knows somethings wrong Over him Hollys bright
face with its rapt look Shes not sure but she enjoys whatevers
happening

144x3 BACK TO DOC
who is playing the console as he speaks

boc
Perfect depth adjustment on this
one Sandman The beam will cut
through that uniform and just
exactly through the skin beneath--
absolute precision Watch now

And the machine does its stuff slashing through Logans tunic--a
seam of blood following the rip

Doc
Of course it doesnt mend uniforms
Sandman but otherwise it does
everything doesnt it Just
imagine what would happen to you
if the healing stopped functioning

And the arm moves back again spraying the healing fluid into
Logans new wound Again the blood disappears

Suddenly Docs look is ferocious He turns off the healing switch
and punches buttons fiercely The laser arms begin to move wildly
and the SOUNDS become shrill Holly looks alarmed

HOLLY
No Youre scrambling the table
Hell be cut to pieces Doc

Doc
Damn right It was a trap They
know

LOGAN
No - Im Running

Machine begins to WHINE LOUDLY

Jessica tries to turn the machine offDoc starts to wrestle with
her as

145-145x4 INTERCUT CLOSE ANGLES - THE CLUSTER ABOVE LOGAN
Moving

HOLLY

Watching two stun beams lower

Doc knocks Jessica down She is groggy on the floor as

The stun beams lance into Logans cheeks

The Table holds him biting into his right leg below the knee
146-148 QUICK CUTS OF DOC AND HOLLY

Watching intently as

149-150 CLOSE ANGLES - LOGAN AND THE CLUSTER ABOVE HIM
As surgical beams slit his shirt from the shoulder to the waist
leaving two threads of blood A vacu-head dips to suck the blood
away neatly

151 ANOTHER ANGLE - LOGAN

As Logan desperately sucks in his bellytrying to flatten himself
into the Table

152-153 CLOSE ANGLES - LOGAN AND THE CLUSTER ABOVE HIM

As laser blades cut into his facefollowed by a spray of healing
liquid on the cuts

154 CLOSE - ON HOLLY

Excitedflushedas

155 CLOSE - ON LOGAN AND THE CLUSTER ABOVE HIM

As two wide blades of light sweep downwardand hover three inches
above his neckand keep lowering HUMMING loudlyand one

inadvertently frees Logans right arm
156 CLOSE ON - DOC

Shocked as Logan reaches for his gun

157 CLOSE - ON LOGAN AND THE CLUSTER ABOVE HIM
As dozens of laser beams slash toward Loganhe twists awayand
breaks offjumping off the Table

Doc rushes Logan holding what appears to he a frozen police billy

In an instant he has knocked Logans gun awayand as Logan looks
down at itwe see it lying on the floor completely frozen

Slowly Doc moves toward Logan the short smoke-colored stick
menacing in his hand

LOGAN (out-of-breath)
What I told you is the

Abruptly Doc lunges toward Loganmissing him as Logan ducks away
As Doc turns to attackLogan smashes his elbows into Docs chest
and Doc falls back onto the Table

157X1 CLOSE ON - HOLLY

SCREAMING as Doc is slashed by the machine amid showers of sparks
and gouts of steam as the metal twists and wires short out and
various fluids boil and spill onto hot surfaces Holly tries to
fight her way into the mess to help Doc but Jessica recovering
pulls her down and the two struggle

157X2 CLOSE ON - DOC
In terror as the laser beams begin to slash him to ribbons
157X3 LOGAN

Making an effort to stop the machine pulling levers and pushing
buttons in vain He sees whats happening pulls Jessica away from
Holly and grabbing up his gun and tunic heads for the entrance
Crossing the waiting room they are stopped by the sight of

Whats going on Logan

LOGAN
It has nothing to do with you

FRANCIS
(choking but still loyal)
What are you talking about I saw you
let a Runner go
(up a notch)
I saw you Logan Tell me

Suddenly the machine behind them erupts into a great burst of smoke
and noise momentarily drawing Francis attention Instantly Logan

jumps him grabs and throws him sprawling Without a look back he

and Jessica run out
166 OUT

166X1 FRANCIS

Enraged finds his gun on the floor and before rising gets off a
shot at them as they disappear Then leaping to his feet dashing
off in pursuit

174 EXT - HALLUCIMILL - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Exiting from the other sideand running through the crowd toward
and into a Love Shopfollowed by Francis coming out of the
Hallucimill too and running toward the Love Shop

175 INT - LOVE SHOP - LOGAN AND JESSICA

As they enter the hot darkness The Love Shop is throbbing with
sexuality In it the darkness breaks at Irregular intervals -- when
booths and cubicles flare into brilliance each time revealing an
orgiastic tableau The Love Shop is multi-leveled and the random
flashes may appear from any direction at any time blinding and
stunning the viewer Logan and Jessica pause to get their bearings
and as they do a beautiful WANTON grabs Logan pulling and
laughing

WANTON
I have an empty one Sandman

Logan tries to pull away looks around for Jessica just in time to
see a man almost carrying her off Then the light is gone again and

Jessica with it

176 LOGAN AND THE WANTON
As she tears at his clothing wrapping herself around him trying to
pull him down Then as the light flares again she suddenly lets go
and grabs another manLogan is freed starts looking for Jessica

177-
179 SERIES OF SHOTS

Logan hunting through the Love Shop fighting them off

INTERCUT SHOTS of the suddenly-illuminated tableaus Sex manifold

and multiform -- everybody doing it

180 ANOTHER ANGLE - FRANCIS

Entering starting to look around -- grabbed by one of the laughing
Wantons

181-182 LOGAN JESSICA

Brief glimpses of them looking for each other
183 FRANCIS

Hunting both

184 WITH LOGAN

As he suddenly collides with a woman -- shoves her away and sees
its Jessica Now together they make for an archway where multiple
mirrors enclose them

Suddenly they are in darkness Then a heavy door slides open and
Jessica leads Logan through the opening Behind them the door slides
shut again

185 FRANCIS

Desperately trying to get rid of a woman sees a flash of Logan and
Jessica far across the room -sees them leave Then hes pulled down
again as the orgy continues

186-
186xX1 OUT

186X2 INT - AN IMMENSE METAL STAIRWAY

After a moment Jessica takes Logans hand and they start down in
the darkness The SOUNDS of Love Shop still heard from behind the
wall

LOGAN
Are you taking me to them
JESSICA
Yes
(beat)
I dont know what else to do -- with
him following us
(she hesitates)
Why do you keep running from your--

LOGAN
Because hes my friend -
(a beat)
and I dont want to be killed by him -
or anyone

JESSICA
Hes good isnt he

LOGAN
Will he find us and kill us
Yesor one of the others
(a beat)
You know theres only one place
to go now

JESSICA (hopelessly)
They wont believe us

LOGAN
(beat)
Id rather take my chances with
themthan with Francis

JESSICA
They wont listen

LOGAN (interrupting)
You think Sandmen will
(before she can answer)
Theres no other way for me

JESSICA
Well convince them

They pause He puts his hand over hers Jessica is silent Then she
turns his hand over The crystal blinks red -- on off

JESSICA
Yes Logan
(turning to him blindly)
Im glad they didnt change your
face
Logan embraces her but his look is strange and remote They
continue down into the darkness

Behind them the SOUNDS of Love Shop die away and only their
footsteps are heard

187 out
187X1 FRANCIS

At the mirrored archway looking around carefully testing He knows
they went through somehow Hands claw at him - he brushes them away
as he searches

188-200 out
200X1 WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA

They have come to the foot of the stair Here the flooring shines
wetly in the darkness

JESSICA (softly)
Exactly four steps now Let me lead you
(they walk)
Now to the right Its narrow here
youll have to get behind me

LOGAN (whispering)
How will they know were coming

JESSICA (whispering)
Theyre watching us now Theyll
let us in when theyre sure

200X2 CLOSE-UP - LOGANS HAND (INSERT)

As he fumbles the transceiver switches at his belt punching out a
signal

200X3 INT - SANDMAN HQ READY ROOM

As the Sandmen monitoring SEE THE SIGNAL FLASH and move smoothly
into action

200X4 LOGAN AND JESSICA

Close together he behind waiting--alert as a VOICE is suddenly
heard

VOICE (scratchy
filtered)
Sandman put your hands on your head
(he does)
Clasp your fingers together Now turn
your hands over Palms up
(beat)
In a moment a light will shine in your
eyes Walk into it--Jessica first
then you Sandman You will have to
stoop--but dont unclasp your hands
Do you agree

Logan nods

Jessica glances back at him but their faces are unreadable in the
dark Then suddenly--in front of her--a blindingly bright narrow
rectangle of light illuminating them fiercely Jessica moves
forward Even she has to stoop Logan is close behind As he bends
awkwardly into the opening the light goes out

201 LOGAN JESSICA -- SANCTUARY HQ

As he pushes her through the opening then moves instantly to the
side pulling her with him The move fails Both are pinned
helplessly in the blinding glare of the spotlight and the sudden
appearance of glass-silver spear points pressed against them Logan
is unable to draw his gun

VOICE
Hold still Sandman or die where
you are

2ND VOICE

Is she the one

OTHER VOICES (like angry
stage whispers)
She betrayed us Kill him Kill them both
Jessica you sold us Sandman butcher
Sandman murderer

Logan and Jessica stand rigid against the spear points only their
heads turning to the echoing sibilants The spotlight goes off

202-204 out
205 INT - SANCTUARY HQ - LOGAN JESSICA - CLOSE

In the darkness we see the glass-silver spear points are glowing all
around them the long shafts falling away into darkness the points
steaming gently when they touch--making an instant wincing burn
Logan moves--a spear point presses--he flinches
LOGAN
Im a runner She brought me here because
I begged her to help me

He turns his palm The red crystal blinks impressively in the
darkness

At the sight a BABBLE of SOUNDS Argument

VOICE
Hes lying No Sandman ever ran

2ND VOICE
You dont run You kill runners
You have killed runners all your life -

LOGAN
Yes I have
(beat)
Now its my turn And I want to
live

Another angry murmur of VOICES Over it Jessica suddenly

JESSICA (shouting)
Whats the matter with you Hes a runner--
hes blinking We must help anyone who
askswe must-or were the same as they
are--deciding who lives and dies

One of the points lifts and touches Jessicas cheek A quick fierce
burn She shrieks--a tiny sound--and is silent

206 LOGAN

Reacts fiercely spinning against the spear points he is Jabbed and
pierced in a dozen places as he manages to get Jessica closer
shielding her with his body But the spear points are too much He
subsides as VOICES rise angrily Kill him now

Suddenly a RINGING ALARM All sound stops at once and we hear a
CLATTER of FOOTSTEPS down the iron stair and across the outer floor
The spotlight bursts on again and a figure staggers into the
chamber straightening into the light hair dishevelled hands in
front against the glare Its Holly

HOLLY
Holly Holly New You 483 Hes dead
Docs dead and the Sandmen came

VOICE (gentle)
Holly--Holly Remember the code
She lowers her hands
bright smile strange

The code please Holly

HOLLY (hysteria)
They smashed everything and I barely
got away
(beat)
Holly Station 12 Sanctuary 7
Holly Holly

and we see her tattered frightened--the
She comes to herself a bit looks to the side

and sees Logan and Jessica pinned against the wall

She reacts with fear

at the sight

HOLLY
Its him The first Sandman He

JESSICA
No Holly--wait Hes running

HOLLY (suddenly
exhausted)

He was in a hurry Just a face job
Dark hair I said Then he killed

machine blew up and I ranI ran

JESSICA
Holly Holly PleaseThe other
Sandman Remember the one who came

Holly suddenly remembers and the shock makes her lucid

HOLLY (pouring
it out)
Thats right The other one came after

The older one Smashing killing burning

JESSICA (coaching
desperately)
and he was hunting the first one
this one Wasnt he Wasnt he This
one was running the other one was
hunting him

HOLLY (remembers)
Yes Oh yes
(to Logan)
He was after you I remember Youre
running

207-208 out

208X1 ANOTHER ANGLE 1

The spear points are withdrawn Logan and Jessica relieved but
shaken wary

LOGAN
May we move

A long beat Then--

VOICE
I saw we pass them through
Somebody help Holly

Other VOICES mumble agreement Holly moves off into the dark room
hands reaching out to help her

VOICE
You two Just go straight ahead
Follow the corridors with the pipes
overhead to the end Then use the key

As the voice speaks the spotlight finally goes off and by a dim glow
around the perimeter we see were in some kind of large underground
chamber--some part of the vast undercellars of the city The light
is enough to reveal that there are perhaps twenty people in the
room reds and greens both--but all are silhouetted no face seen
Theres a kind of aisle open down the rooms center and its
obviously the way they are to go Logan and Jessica move off Logan
pauses

LOGAN
I dont know who you are Id
like to thank someone

VOICE
It doesnt matter who we are Follow
the tunnel to the end

LOGAN
I Will there be someone to tell us
where to go from there

A murmur of discussion then

VOICE
Someone will follow When you come to
the lock he will tell you how Co go
on the other side Jessica may go with
you as far as the lock

LOGAN
(a deep breath)

No Jessica goes back now Take her back
(suddenly his tone is
urgent as he speaks to her)

Now Go on back Back outside Jessica

She is bewildered by the change

JESSICA
Why- NonoIm going with you

VOICE1
Only to the lock After that
theres no way back

JESSICA (small voice)
I dont care Im going to Sanctuary
With you

A BABBLE of VOICES ImpossibleShe ignores watches Logan

JESSICA (contd)
Will you take me with you

LOGAN
Why Jessica Youre still a green

JESSICA shakes her head She doesnt know why

Logan puts his arm around her marveling trying to understand
moved But suddenly he remembers the urgency of the moment He
wheels pulling her with him

LOGAN
Come on then--theyll be here any
minute

Uncomprehending she starts to run with him Too late An EXPLOSION
shakes the chamber--the wall bellies inward and a group of Sandmen
led by Francis burst into the room firing as they come

Panic Turmoil PEOPLE running SCREAMING--the ALARM BELL RINGING
RINGING as Sandmen methodically slaughter the people in the wreckage
of the room

209 OUT
209X1 LOGAN AND JESSICA

As the brief one-sided battle rages echoing SHOTS and SCREAMS in
the dust filled room Logan pulls her down out of the way They
watch helplessly Suddenly the figure of a Sandman looms before
them He stares at Logan unsure Logan reacts draws fires The
Sandman is smashed away burning

209X2 LOGAN

Suddenly aware that he has killed a Sandman Jessica pulls him down
again into the shadow Neither realizes chat the soft pulsing of his
crystal can be seen from the room

210 ANOTHER ANGLE

Francis quartering the room like a hound searching searching
stopping as he sees

211 FRANCIS POV
The crystal blinking red eerie in the darkness

FRANCIS

(believing the

blinking crystal is Jessicas)
Logan I know youre in here
Whatve you donegone crazy over a
Runner

(whispering)
Nobody knows except me You know I
wont say anything I should have
turned you in but I couldnt Leave
her Come on out with me Itll look
like youre part of the group that
hit this nest

(pleading)
Loganyoure a Sandman

(slightest beat)
LogannownowLogan

After the slightest beat Logan FIRES and Francis falls a great
chunk of the cave roof falling between him and Logan -- all vision
obscured while EXPLOSIONS and SCREAMS continue

212 LOGAN AND JESSICA

As he pulls her shakily to her feet She nods shes okay He leads
her off down the tunnel

213 WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA - TUNNEL
following the tracks The way leads down curves recurves but
always down

214 ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING LOCK

As Logan and Jessica rush toward it The corridor has widened into a
kind of chamber which ends in a great metal door like an immense
submarine hatch

The tracks run straight to it and beneath it The base of the door
tands in a couple of inches of water

With great urgency Logan and Jessica examine the huge door Logan
gives the wheel a tugnothing

SOUND A WHIRRING like clockworkA METALLIC BELL SOUND and then a
RECORDED VOICE

VOICE
Runner this is the last gate Use
your key now When the Bell sounds
againuse your key Good luck
Runner May you find Sanctuary

SILENCE Then the BELL CHIME SOUND and a light illumines the center
of the wheel where theres a kind of keyhole The WHIRRING continues
for about ten seconds Then it stops and the light goes out

214X1 LOGAN AND JESSICA
Hearing a SOUND they turn and see
214X2 ANOTHER ANGLE - POV

Far behind them in the wet glisten of the tunnel a bobbing light
and shadow -- the SOUND of RUNNING

215-216 CLOSE ON - LOGAN AND JESSICA
As Jessica takes the ankh from her neck - fumbling with the chain

JESSICA (breathlessly)
Every key only works onceand only
a Lastday key must open this door
They said it would fit - but

She tries to fit the ankh into the glowing one but her hand shakes
Logan tries to steady her - and in helping she drops it into the
dark pool of water They fall to their knees searching desperately
Then Logan remembers
LOGAN
Wait - I have the one I took from
the Runner

SOUND The same as before as Logan searches his pockets for the
Runners ankh

Logan finds it just as the WHIRRING SOUND has STOPPED againand
the light has gone out again in the center of the wheel

As Logan and Jessica wait for the sound etcetera to repeat again
another TREMENDOUS EXPLOSION is heard rocking everything In the
distance Jessica can see the shadow of a FIGURE approaching

As the SOUND etcetera repeat-s once moreLogan pushes the ankh
into the lighted center of the wheel The ankh fuses and the lighted
center becomes brighter as the door opens

There is a hesitationin which Logan turning his head back
realizes what he has done and is shaken

As the shadowed FIGURE looms LARGER

JESSICA
Theres no turning back is there

Logan turns and pushes Jessica through the door following her
as the door closes and they are

217 ON THE OTHER SIDE
now they can still hear the SOUND etcetera for the last time

Beyond the lock is the ruins of a vast undersea complex in which
food was raised and harvested What we see is an endless shadowy
labyrinth of breeding pens which stretch off into the green darkness
-- a kind of mammoth aquarium with catwalks and ramps intersecting
the huge tanks The levels are multiple and everything is slimed
rusted rotted and wet

In the tanks themselves are shoals of fish gardens of seaweed etc
The machinery for harvesting and winnowing has long since gone to

rust -- and visible in the great tanks are the wrecks of vessels and
gear -- the kind of stuff Cousteau and Co are using now
Footing is dangerous -- a slip from any catwalk means a plunge into

water and some of the walkways are well under water anyhow From an
invisible ceiling comes a steady dripping and everything is crusted
and smells of salt and decay and life in the darkness

217X1 WITH FRANCIS
As he arrives at the door the ankh glowing as before

But Francis has a light He examines the door with it and as it
lights the pool of water on the ground it picks out Jessicas ankh
FRANCIS stoops gets it and looks from it to the one glowing

128 LOGAN AND JESSICA

Bewildered -- uncertain as their eyes adjust to the dim light
Finally Logan gestures this way and sets out

(NOTE The action of the sequence is the action of people groping
through a labyrinth They go along gripping a rail where possible
sometimes sinking deep into water sometimes rising above it They
run into blind endings and retrace to the last junction -- always
trying for what looks driest and seems to stretch farthest along the
great wall)

219-224 WITH LOGAN AND JESSICA - SERIES OF CUTS
A Making their way along the walkway side by side

B Stopping as the walkway disappears under water Logan wading in
while she waits -- until he re-emerges She follows

C Choosing between diverging ramps Having to return

JESSICA
How do we know this is the right
way

LOGAN

Its the only way

D POV an alley way full of machinery Logan gives a wheel a half
turn -- great rusty net-combs start to winnow the water

E Helping Jessica Logan slipsfalls into darkness Jessicas
fear until he emerges hand over slimy hand The water is cold

F POV ancient signs - PROTOPLANKDEPOT NO 11 DO NOT DECANT
HABITAT MARITIMEETC

They speculate

JESSICA
What do you suppose this was
LOGAN
Some kind of breeding pensI

supposeThey say people used
to breed animal s fish anything
(at her disbelieving look)
To eat of course

JESSICA
Yech
(shudders)
To kill things and then eat them
It must have been a savage world

Logan shrugs but the idea makes him queasy too

G They stop tired Peer through at the wreckage of a small
inspection vessel and suddenly hear

SOUND FOOTSTEPS coming halting WATER sloshing Steps again
225 POV - THROUGH THE MAZE OF TANKS - A LIGHT
moving hunting

LOGAN (alert)
Stay here while I see what it is

Jessica nods frightened Logan slips off into the darkness In a
moment hes back His face - is grim

JESSICA
Its Francis isnt it

He nods

226 LOGAN AND JESSICA

Trying to move faster now Logan makes a wrong turning and they must
go back But as they do so Francis is ever closer -- a gigantic
distorted SHAPE now visible through the eerie glass -then suddenly

seeming small and distant

As they emerge from the blind alley once again close to the wall
suddenly

227 FRANCIS

228 LOGAN AND JESSICA

Logan desperately claws at machinery succeeds in starting motion
somewhere what sounds like a GENERATOR begins laboring ancient

machinery GROANS

They turn and run as they HEAR
FRANCIS (distorted
echo etcetera)
LOGAN N N N

229 POV - FRANCIS LIGHT
is splashing the walls ahead and in it they suddenly see

THE DOOR -- a waterlock with a wheel As the light passes Logan
heaves desperately on it It starts to give as the light comes back
and they are revealed

230 CLOSE - ON FRANCIS

aiming at Loganthen slowly moving his hand until Jessica is in
his sights

231 LOGAN - JESSICA - FRANCIS

Francis FIRES -- tremendous SOUND ECHOING and RESOUNDING One of
the great tanks buckles and a cascade of water erupts over
everything Through it Logan manages to get the door open and
pushes a half-drowning Jessica through

232 INT - THE SHAFT

A sort of ancient freight elevator which commences to move groaning
when the waterlock door closes

Logan slumps to the floor
233 INT - SHAFT - TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA

Moving at an extremely high speedWe can see the outside -
flickering - dark light - dark light and finally to a white
color They lie slumped motionless Finally it stops The door
opens into a kind of glistening darkness suffused by a bluish glow
It is now very cold

In the silence Logan stirs Groping he touches Jessica who moves
close to him Logan puts his arm around her and they rise Slowly
tentatively he leads her out into the dark chamber where they stand
for a moment trying to find themselves What little light there is
seems to come from the left Arm around Jessica Logan starts to
move

JESSICA (whispering)
Im afraid

LOGAN
Its brighter therebesides we
cant go back

He starts to move again but Jessica hangs back

He halts

JESSICA
Wait

JESSICA (contd)
I dont know whats going to happen

LOGAN

234-236 out
236x1 INT - ICE CAVERN

Suddenly they are blinded by a brilliant light coming from the side
and revealing for the first time where they are

236x2 ANGLE

Before them a vase dim ice-shrouded storage area row upon endless
row of frozen lockers trailing away into darkness their legends and
contents unreadable in the thick covering of ice and frost To the
side a bright light

Walk toward the light

239 FULL ANGLE - BOX
Box is half-manhalf-metal

From the midpoint of his sternum to his hips he is coils and cables
One hand is a cutting tool His head is half-fleshhalf-metal his
legs are a chrome pedestal

BOX
Are you too startled Am I too
removed from your ken
(slightest beat)
Im neither machine nor manbut

as Jessica hesitates
Logan smiles)

240-241 JESSICA
Undresses

Box motions to a pedestal covered with deep white furs

BOX
Up there
Logan helps Jessica up to the pedestal As they stand there

LOGAN

BOX (beat)
Up there

Logan looks at Jessica Her beauty is glowing in the lamplight
Logan takes Jessica into his arms

BOX
Enchanting Is that what humans do

By this time Logan and Jessica are no longer listening to
Boxtheir arms are enveloping one anotherwith strong feelings

BOXS VOICE

242 ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING BOX

As his metal hand begins to BUZZhe brings it to the base of the
huge column supporting the cavern

LOGAN

bargain
BOX (rapt by his
work)

the birds sing over you
LOGAN (only interested
in getting out)

Were ready

Box mumbles as he leads Logan and Jessica toward the rear of the Ice
Cavern

250 INT - ICE ROOM

As Box enters followed by Logan and Jessica

This room has a fairly low ceiling and it is not too wide
It stretches back as far as the eye can see

The ice along the left wall is frostedbut the ice along the right
wall is perfectly clear

And embedded in the ice along the perfectly clear right wall are
251 WIDE ANGLE - MEN AND WOMEN
Standing in erect positions

At first it appears that they might be more of Boxs perfect works
of sculpture
But as Logan and Jessica examine them closely through the clear

iceit is soon apparent that they are real peoplewho have been
frozen
252 CLOSE ON LOGAN AND JESSICA

Horrified as they move slowly along the wall

253 ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING THE MEN AND WOMEN FROZEN
IN THE WALL

We can see that each of them has a black crystal flower in the palm
of their right hands

Logan walks to the end of this wall Each frozen body has a number
above it The final bodys number is 1056That number which the

voice in Sandmans headquarters revealed as the number of missing

Runners

The CAMERA PANS Logan back to Box

254 ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING BOX

As Logan turns toward him

LOGAN (stupefied)
How did they get in here

BOX
Regular storage procedurethe

other food stopped coming and they
started

LOGAN
What other food

BOX

Fish and plankton sea greens and
protein from the sea

(pointing to the frosted

ice wall)
Its all here - ready - fresh as

Box laughsThe same LOUD ROARING LAUGH we HEARD earlier Then
BOX (calmly)

Box starts his saw hand BUZZING He turns all the flesh parts of
his body away from Logan and starts advancing toward him and Jessica
who is now standing behind Logan
Box is now like an armed vehicle

Logan FIRESthe fire reflecting harmlessly off Boxs metal frame

BOX (advancing)
Resign yourself

255 MED ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA
Retreatingas Logan FIRES again and againto no avail

As Logan and Jessica retreat further and further toward the rear of
this room and

256 REVERSE ANGLE - BOX
Advancing

We can SEE PERSON AFTER PERSONembedded in the clear wall of ice
A strange mute audience to this to-the-death drama

257 TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA
Finally reaching the rear wall of this room as
258 REVERSE ANGLE - BOX

Relentlessly moving toward them

259 TWO SHOT - LOGAN AND JESSICA
Seemingly pinned back against the rear wall

Logan is FIRING his gun futilely with his right handwhile moving
his empty hand against the rear walltrying to find a knob or
button which might open it
The entire time he never takes his eyes off
260 REVERSE ANGLE - BOX
Getting closer The saw is BUZZING LOUDLY
BOX (chilling tone)
I make such a small quick incision
you can hardly feel it

261 REVERSE ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA

themon the ceilingthere are a number of exposed cables

262 FULL ANGLE - LOGAN JESSICA AND BOX
Box is practically upon them As he lunges forward with his
WHIRRING saw hand Logan pushes Jessica to the floor and drops down

alongside her

Box cannot stop his forward thrust and cuts a sizable chunk of ice
out of the rear wall as

Logan SHOOTS at Box from the floor Levelupwards trying to
penetrate some part of his seemingly impregnable body He misses but
hits the exposed cables on the ceiling
There is an EXPLOSION
BOX (looking up
screaming)

No The coils

Box rushes past Logan and Jessica toward the huge ice cavern
containing his sculptures

BOX (still screaming)

AS the effect multiplies--Ln the hissing vapor-sculptures crashing
over and enormous chunks of ice loosened and crashing

Careening around wildly in the growing ruin as the lights dim and
flicker out

The ceiling full of birds loosening crashing down upon Box Again
and again like great spears and wedges

270X8 BOX

Buried in his work still feebly moving then still as the roaring
ice crashes down in the terrible darkness

270X9 LOGAN AND JESSICA

Cowering in the crashing maelstrom of ice blocks--saved only by
Being in an angle of the cave

The SCREEN blotted out by the cave-in going out of focus Silence
Then

SOUND Ice melting water running
270X11 LOGAN AND JESSICA
Stir in the dimness amazed to be alive

SOUND A heavy crash and splash as another huge ice block falls into
the water

As it falls the cave is suddenly illuminated again They look and
see the light is coming from a great fissure in the wall--opened by
the last ice fall Water rains across the opening
Logan and Jessica make their way to it step out

It all seemed to make sense until
Box
JESSICA
Do you think he was telling the
Truth

Logan shrugs

JESSICA (trying to

convince herself)

through

(hopeful tone)
Maybe Sanctuary is near now

be outside

LOGAN (grunts)
How would anyone know Even if we find
it -- we can never go back

At her stricken lookLogan touches her in a caring way

OLD MAN

Yes indeed everyone Actually

(reciting)
The naming of cats is a difficult
matter It isnt just one of your
holiday games You may think at
first Im mad as a hatter when I
tell you a cat must have THREE
DIFFERENT NAMES

(a beat)
An ordinary name and a fancy name
Thats two Do you want to guess
what the third one is

Logan and Jessica are silent

OLD MAN (reciting again)

But above and beyond theres
still one name left over
And that is the name that you
never will guess
The name that no human research
can discover -- -
But THE CAT HIMSELF KNOWS and
will never confess

(reaching down and

stroking another cat)
Will you my pet

One of the cats jumps off his lap
