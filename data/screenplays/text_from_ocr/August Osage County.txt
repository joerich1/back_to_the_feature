AN ENDLESS SKY AT TWILIGHT 1

Foreboding Heat lightning in the distance Miles of
unforgiving summer-scorched prairie

BEVERLY (OS)
Life is very long

MILES OF STRAIGHT ROAD 2

Two lanes not a car in sight Cracked asphalt undulates over
gentle browned hills disappears into an infinite horizon

BEVERLY (OS)
TS Eliot Not the first person to say
it certainly not the first person to
think it

A LAKE IN THE GATHERING DUSK 3

Flat still An empty aluminum rowboat lolls listlessly
tied haphazardly to an old wooden dock

BEVERLY (OS)
But hes given credit for it because
he bothered to write it down

AN OLD FARM HOUSE SITTING ATOP A LOW HILL 4
At the end of a long gravel road Surrounded by towering
black walnuts and lace-bark elms A farm once no ones put

a plow to earth here in decades

BEVERLY (OS)
So if you say it you have to say his
name after it Life is very long TS
Eliot Absolutely goddamn right

Wrap around porches forgotten gardens Imposing in the

gathering gloom A single downstairs window glows

BEVERLY (OS) (CONTD)
Give the devil his due Very few
poets couldve made it through Eliots
trial and come out brilliantined and
double-breasted and Anglican

And now a face fills the screen --

INT BEVERLYS DIMLY LIT STUDY - TWILIGHT 5

BEVERLY WESTON A craggy wise and deeply sad Okie We take
a long moment just to study that face

BEVERLY
Not hard to imagine faced with
Eliots first wife lovely Viv how
Crane or Berryman might have reacted
just foot-raced to the nearest bridge
Olympian Suicidalists

Stares out the window at the darkening ominous horizon

BEVERLY (CONTD)
Not Eliot after sufficient years of
ecclesiastical guilt plop her in the
nearest asylum and get on with it

He sits at a cluttered desk his face damp with sweat Nurses
a glass of whiskey his staggered delivery due more to his
careful selection of words than drunkenness Hes talking to
someone we do not yet see

BEVERLY (CONTD)
God-a-mighty You have to admire the
purity of the survivors instinct

From somewhere upstairs a THUD He looks to the ceiling

BEVERLY (CONTD)
Violet My wife She takes pills
sometimes a great many They affect
among other things her equilibrium
Fortunately they eliminate her need
for equilibrium

INT VIOLETS BEDROOM - TWILIGHT 6
Full of shadows She sits up slowly from rumpled sheets
Were on her profile CLOSE silhouetted against the faint
light from the open bathroom door She hesitates on the edge
of the bed getting her bearings Finds a pack of Winstons
lights one Listens to the voices filtering up from below

INT THE STUDY - TWILIGHT

Beverly shifts waiting for the sound of more movement from
the rooms overhead When there is none --

BEVERLY
My wife takes pills and I drink
Thats the bargain weve struck

INTERCUT WITH

INT VIOLETS BEDROOMUPSTAIRS HALLWAY - TWILIGHT

She gathers herself to stand Moves to the door We FOLLOW
HER CLOSELY Her hair unkempt her steps unsteady into --

BEVERLY
The reasons why we partake are
anymore inconsequential

The hallway walls lined with photos of long-dead pioneer
ancestors and faded school photographs of three daughters

BEVERLY (CONTD)
The facts are my wife takes pills and
I drink Thats the bargain weve
struck just one paragraph of our
marriage contract cruel covenant
And these facts have over time made
burdensome the maintenance of
traditional American routine

She makes her way to the stairs starts down

BEVERLY (CONTD)
Rather than once more vow abstinence
with my fingers crossed in the queasy
hope of righting our ship Ive chosen
to turn my life over to a Higher Power
and join the ranks of the Hiring
Class
The light from the study slices across the living room

BEVERLY (CONTD)
Its not a decision with which Im
entirely comfortable I know how to
launder my dirty undies Done it all
my life but Im finding its getting
in the way of my drinking

She can see a portion of Beverlys desk a womans legs

9 OPENING TITLES

Were underwater Light fractures and scatters above The
surface undulating gently as we GLIDE through a lakes
dark tenebrous waters on a moonlit night

A rowboat SLIPS across our field of vision Its aluminum
hull cutting through the calm above sending out small waves
as it makes its way SLOWLY past

Oars dip in on either side propelling the small craft toward
deeper water It slows Stops Bobs gently We wait watch --

And then suddenly something large hits the surface above
indistinct exploding the calm coming towards us sinking
fast as TITLES END --

Her expression is unreadable enigmatic

running through the field

Barbara takes off after her Ivy and Karen climb out but
dont follow Shield their eyes to watch the chase

Its an odd sight the two women racing through the grass
One almost seventy the other nearing fifty

Barbara is slow in her pursuit at first maybe because of her
shoes or maybe because she just feels silly Then realizes
that Violet is not stopping not unless Barbara stops her

Violet runs through the tall grass puts a foot wrong goes
down Barbara catches up out of breath collapses They
lay on the ground wheezing sweating
