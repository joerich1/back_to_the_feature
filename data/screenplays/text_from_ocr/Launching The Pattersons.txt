what just happened

He glances over to see Harrison watching him A grin spreads
across Harrisons face as he realizes hes got Wills job

EXT SANTA MONICA AIRPORT - PRESENT DAY
SUPER TEN YEARS LATER

INT PETES FLIGHT ACADEMY - CLASSROOM - DAY

Wills bored out of his mind as he stands in front of ten
STUDENTS teaching flight 101 Hes packed on a beer gut
hasnt shaven for weeks and dark circles of stress and sub-
par living line his eyes

WILL

If you lose control of the craft and
get into a dead spin you should eject

(flipping through the

text book)
Theres a whole section here about
surviving if your plane lands in
water but if you go down in water
youre toast
The students exchange concerned looks

WILL (CONTD)
Dont worry you just fly like I
teach you and youll be fine

An eager hand pops up a sparkly TEEN KID with bright eyes
brimming with hope Will hates this kid

KID
Is it true you were an astronaut

WILL
Yeah Now if you do find yourself
in a downward spiral --

KID
Could I be an astronaut

Will takes in the kid He hates this question

WILL
Sure you could go to the Airforce
Academy bust your ass flying jets
get chosen for NASA go through
six years of intensive training
getting paid like a janitor and
then at the last minute theyll cut
your balls off ground you forever
and leave you with a wife who thinks
youre a loser and kicks you out
because her therapist tells her youre
a dead weight to her dreams If
that sounds awesome go for it

The students look at him stunned Will glances at the clock

WILL (CONTD)
Thatll be all for today Study up

INT PETES FLIGHT ACADEMY - WILLS OFFICE - DAY

A hot and cramped flight office Will lights a smoke and
kicks his feet up on the piles of stale paperwork His
attention is drawn to the small TV in the corner

ON THE TV Katie Couric addresses us with her robotically
soothing serious anchor voice

KATIE COURIC
The China National Space
Administration has shocked the world
today by sending the first civilian
family into space
Will sits up - holy shit

CLIPS ON TV An Asian family floats weightlessly in their
space ship waving to the camera

KATIE COURIC (VO) (CONTD)
The Li family paid twenty million

history
Will watches the happy family train his jaw clenches

WILL
Lucky SOBs

Wills cell phone rings
WILL (CONTD)
(on the phone)
Hey Dex Wait slow down - a fight

Will leaves the office and we close in on the TV and the
Lis happy smiling faces

CLOSE ON Wingtip shoes hurry down a marble hallway

INT JOHNSONS SPACE CENTER - EXECUTIVE OFFICES - DAY

WILSON a tall lanky tech geek in an ill-fitting suit strides
down the hall a concerned look on his face

INT JSC - EXECUTIVE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Wilson bursts in on the meeting with NASAs top brass

WILSON
Its confirmed China sent up a
family in their new space jet

James Duvall now ten years older and NASAs Chief of
Operations throws his pen down

DUVALL
And China just took the lead in the
space race

Joe Dempsey Wills former Mission Specialist and current
Chief of Development turns to Duvall
They turn

DEMPSEY
We have to get the Galaxy Jet up
there Its faster cheaper and

drastically safer than the shuttle
It puts us back in the game

DUVALL
Im not pulling the budget from the
shuttles The Space Station needs
vital repairs - the oxygen filter
system cant wait

ZOE SHELTON (0S)

Gentlemen youre talking about money

for missions that wont exist in
four months

to ZOE SHELTON a smart sexy PR

DUVALL
This is Zoe Shelton shes a
consultant sent from the Pentagon

The guys exchange looks - fing consultants

She walks

ZOE SHELTON

I save sinking ships and right now
NASA is the Titanic

(standing for her

power-point)
Congress votes on your budget in
four months and in this economic
crisis no ones willing to give
millions of dollars for a bunch of
science geeks to get their rocks
off

DEMPSEY

It actually takes billions of dollars

to get our rocks off

ZOE SHELTON
Thats my point We need an event
to make space relevant again to the
average American

around the room selling her pitch like

ZOE SHELTON (CONTD)
We need an event that brings us back

to the days when everyone was huddled
around the TV to watch Neil Armstrong

walk on the moon We need to bring
the magic back

pitbull

Don Draper

DUVALL
What do you suggest Ms Shelton

ZOE SHELTON

China sent a family into orbit I
say we send a family to the Space
Station

Skeptical looks are exchanged

ZOE SHELTON (CONTD)
Sending a family shows the future of
space belongs to the average American
(to Dempsey )
Send them in the Galaxy and we prove
were still the leader of the space
race

DEMPSEY
Im feeling the magic

DUVALL
Ms Shelton youre talking about
this like its a trip to the mall
This is still space - anything can
happen We need qualified astronauts

DEMPSEY
So we start with astronauts -
astronauts that have families

Duvall considers this He turns to Dempsey

DUVALL
If you can get a family to pass all
the tests of real astronauts and I
mean all of them I1l consider
sending them up with a crew

DEMPSEY
Ill get right on it

time with them

LANEY

opens up their world to be other
things than Gwen Stefani and Jack
Kerouac

(sincerely)
This could be a chance for us to
pull together as a family

He puts his hand on hers She considers his hand then gives
him a penetrating look

LANEY
Fine Ill give you this last chance
But this has got to be about more
than space This has got to be about
you bringing our family together

WILL
Ill be plugged in like never before

LANEY
And if things dont change I mean
really change then when we get back
I want a divorce

INT MISSION CONTROL - NIGHT
An ALARM SOUNDS The tech hops to Duvall comes

DUVALL
Whats the problem

Wilson stands up

WILSON
Its the space station sir There
a problem - the back-up oxygen system
has failed

Panic sets in

DUVALL
How did this happen

DEMPSEY
We need to focus on solutions We
can have the shuttle ready to launch
tomorrow

WILSON
Tomorrows too late - today is too
late Theyve only got two days
worth of oxygen

DUVALL
Get all your tech guys on it The
Galaxy can get there in time
Dempsey prep an emergency crew - we
need to send someone who can fix the
system on-site

in

WILSON
Sir its not designed to do that -
its like open heart surgery in the
middle of a battlefield

DUVALL
So I need surgery and its the battle
field who do I send

WILSON
Bronson is our best man Hes been
able to fix it twice in simulations
We may be able to talk him through
it

DEMPSEY
Jake Bronsons in the hospital with
a broken tibia

WILSON
Howd he do that

DEMPSEY
Mountain biking

DUVALL
Damn Get him in here anyway I
dont care if hes in a stretcher
we need his brains on this Who
else

WILSON
The only other person Ive seen do
it consistently in that short of
time is that Patterson kid

DUVALL
Give me a real choice Who else

WILSON
Sir if youre asking me who has the
best chance of fixing this in space
Im telling you its the Patterson
kid

Looks are exchanged

DUVALL
So Im supposed to put the fate of
five astronauts and a billion dollar
piece of equipment in the hands of a
14-year-old

WILSON
A 14-year-old genius
DUVALL
This is crazy Okay who would we
crew him up with

DEMPSEY
I would have as little variables as
possible The crew he trained with
for 600 hours

Duvall gives him a look

DUVALL
You want me to send the Pattersons

DEMPSEY
With myself and Handcock The three

of us could land the ship by
ourselves

Do you know what happens if I send
up a family and anything goes wrong

DEX

Thats a catastrophic event
JOHNNY

Wait Why
KIRSTEN

Because you need air to breathe
dumbshit

DEX
They only have two days of oxygen at
best Theres no time for the shuttle
to retrieve the primary system - or
even deliver a back-up system in the
shuttle

WILL
Right Thats where you come in
They think if anyone has a shot of
fixing the primary system in orbit
its you

JOHNNY
Whoa youre like Luke Skywalker
Youre their only hope Dex

WILL
The only way the system can be fixed
is by using a robotic attachment off
the EMU

a hit of his inhaler
LANEY

Will this is too much to ask of a
fourteen year old kid

DEX
Im not a kid guys Im an
astronaut I know I can do it

(then to Will)
Im the only one who can

Wills never been prouder of his son Will looks to

LANEY
If we do this we need a serious
crew I mean the best of the best

first on my list
