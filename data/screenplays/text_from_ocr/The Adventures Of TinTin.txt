EXT STREET MARKET - DAY
The SWIRLING COLOURS of an ARTIST’S PALATE

A STREET ARTIST bearing an uncanny resemblance to HERGE is
sketching a young man with his back to the camera They are
in the middle of a busy street market

STREET ARTIST
Very nearly there sir I have to
say your face is familiar Have I
drawn you before

TINTIN (0C)
Occasionally

STREET ARTIST
Of course I’ve seen you in the
newspaper You‘re a reporter

ANGLE ON A WHITE DOG is sitting looking a little bored at
the subjects feet The DOG whimpers

TINTIN
I’m a journalist Be patient Snowy
- not much longer

Two patent leather shoes enter frame distracting SNOWY
SNOWY leaves to follow the MAN who deftly picks the pockets
of market patrons as he goes

ANGLE ON SNOWY as he trots through the crowd keeping his
eyes on the PICKPOCKET

The PICKPOCKET bumps into another market patron and snatches
their wallet

PICKPOCKET
I do beg your pardon

ANGLE ON SNOWY follows the PICKPOCKET as a hand continues to
snatch wallets and handbags from their unsuspecting owners

STREET ARTIST
There I believe Ive captured
something of your likeness

The STREET ARTIST hands TINTIN the picture showing the
CARTOON TINTIN

our fully-dimensional TINTIN admires it

TINTIN
Not bad What do you think Snowy

TINTIN looks around - SNOWY isn’t there

TINTIN (CONT‘D)
(exasperated)
Snowy-

TINTIN hands money to the artist and leaves in search of
SNOWY

TINTIN (CONT’D)
There you are sir Now where’s he
run off to

As TINTIN strolls through the market he passes two pairs of
eyes (the THOM(P)SONS) peering through holes cut ina

TINTIN has paused by a stall selling mirrors which reflect
multiple images of his famous quiff A DOG BARK

SNOWY runs over
TINTIN (CONTD)
Where have you been heh Chasing

ANGLE ON TINTIN just as something has caught his eye in the
reflection of a stall selling cheap antiques
TINTIN (CONT’D)
Snowy - look at this

CLOSE ON A magnificent model sailing ship in a glass case
TINTIN and SNOWY walk towards it and bend down to take a
closer look

TINTIN leans in closer Intricate detail fills the frame as
if the boat were real We can almost hear the sea the shouts
of sailors the cry of gulls

TINTIN (CONT’D)
Triple masted double decks fifty
guns Isn‘t she a beauty

CRABTREE (0S)

find another one of these mate
And it’s only two quid

TINTIN
Ill give you a pound

CRABTREE
(relieved)
Done
CRABTREE stands as TINTIN pays him

ANGLE ON BARNABY a large man in a tight blue suit is
lumbering through the market distracted and under pressure

CRABTREE lifts the model ship from the case and hands it
over

CRABTREE (CONTD)
Gently does it

BARNABY continues to shove his way through the crowd

MARKET PATRON
Excuse me

CRABTREE releases the boat into TINTIN’s hands

CRABTREE
There you go careful

SUDDENLY An AMERICAN VOICE

BARNABY Hey bud

BARNABY arrives at the stall out of breath

BARNABY (CONTD)

young gent

BARNABY

TINTIN

BARNABY
Look kid I’m trying to help you
out - I don’t think you realize
this but you’re about to walk into
a whole mess of danger

TINTIN
What kind of danger
BARNABYs expression changes to a look of alarm

BARNABY
I’m warning you - get rid of the
boat and get out while you still
can These people do not play nice

BARNABY moves back into the crowd

TINTIN
What people

VOICE (0C)
Wonderful

TINTIN turns around to find a TALL STOOPED-MAN standing
behind him - this is SAKHARINE He wears a long macintosh and
tall bowler with a coal black beard fierce bright eyes and
pince-nez

SAKHARINE
It’s just wonderful Dont bother
wrapping it I’1ll take it - ‘as
is’ Does anybody object if I pay
by cheque

CRABTREE
If you want to buy it you’ll have
to talk to the kid

SAKHARINE
T see Well let the kid name his
price

CRABTREE

(quiet despair)

Name his price Ten years I’ve
been flogging bric-a-brac and I
miss “name your price” by one
bleedin’ minute

TINTIN
I’m sorry I already explained to
the other gentleman -

SAKHARINE frowns looking around

CRABTREE
American - he was All hair oil and
no socks

TINTIN

SAKHARINE
Then let me appeal to your better
nature I have recently acquired
Marlinspike Hall and this ship as
Im sure you’re aware was once
part of the estate

TINTIN
Of the late sea captain

SAKHARINE
The family fell upon hard times
lost everything Theyd been living
in a cloud of bad luck ever since
We are talking generations of
drinking and irrational behavior -

TINTIN
I’m sorry but as I told you before

SAKHARINE glares at TINTIN

TINTIN (CONT’D)
Good day to you sir

TINTIN tucks the MODEL SHIP under his arm nods politely
leaves SNOWY cocks his snout indignantly and follows

inscrutable face
INT TINTIN’S APARTMENT - DAY

TINTIN

What is it about this ship Why has

it attracted so much attention
He sets the model down on his sideboard

TINTIN studies the MODEL SHIP

TINTIN (CONTD)
What secrets do you hold

and

TINTIN hurries to the next room He takes off his coat and
sets it down on the couch He enters a small office and hunts
around his desk for his magnifying glass an old typewriter
sits there in pride of place surrounded by artifacts from
far-off places

TINTIN (CONTD)
Ah Where is that magnifying glass

As TINTIN looks around - we see glimpses of his LIFE framed
PICTURES and NEWSPAPER STORIES featuring past adventures
TINTIN posing with familiar CHARACTERS from early travels

TINTIN (CONTD)
Could have sworn it was No
Where could it possibly be Snowy
you havent seen

He moves to the large bookcase

TINTIN (CONTD)
Where is it

SNOWY surprises him he is holding the magnifying glass in
his jaws

TINTIN (CONTD)
Thank you

TINTIN takes it

CLOSE ON MAGNIFYING GLASS He turns around to find the cat
standing in the doorway SNOWY turns and GROWLS

TINTIN (CONTD)
No Snowy

ANGLE ON A WHITE CAT has slipped in through the open window
SNOWY instantly BARKS and chases the CAT which springs back
up into the living room

TINTIN rushes back into the living room and finds SNOWY
chasing the CAT

The CAT swings wildly from a chandelier climbs up the drapes
and over a bookshelf SNOWY goes above it As he races across
the sideboard after the CAT he knocks over the UNICORN

TINTIN chases the CAT towards the window and slides on the
floor

He hears the CRASH TINTIN spins around the SOUND

CLOSE ON The MODEL SHIP lies on the floor mast broken off
near the base

TINTIN gently picks up the BROKEN MODEL SHIP

TINTIN (CONTD)
(annoyed)
Look what you did You broke it
Bad dog

He turns the ship over not noticing a SMALL METAL TUBE that
drops onto the FLOOR

CLOSE ON TINTIN moves closer to the sideboard and
unknowingly kicks the tube under the low cabinet SNOWY tries
to PAW at it but it rolls away the more SNOWY paws at it
the further he pushes it until it rolls all the way under
the cabinet

CLOSE ON TINTIN examines the damage the mast is hollow
and has snapped near the deck TINTIN puts the MAST loosely
back in place

TINTIN (CONTD)
Something happened on this ship
And were going to the one place
that could have the answer

TINTIN grabs his coat and heads out of the apartment

TINTIN (CONTD)
cmon Snowy

TINTIN and SNOWY leave the apartment Someone is watching
through binoculars from outside the window They focus on the
SHIP

INT LIBRARY - EVENING

ANGLE ON TINTIN sits in the gothic library a tiny figure
dwarfed by towering shelves

CLOSE ON TINTIN is reading a old thick maritime
encyclopedia He turns the page and whispers to SNOWY

TINTIN
(low whisper)
Here it is “Sir Francis Haddock of
Marlinspike Hall the last Captain
of the ill-fated Unicorn
(MORE )
TINTIN (CONTD)
The ship set sail from Barbados in
1676 on one of the most ruinous
voyages in maritime history ship
never reached destination

CLOSE ON An old illustration of the UNICORN under full sail

TINTIN (CONT’D)
--attacked by pirates all hands
lost except for one survivor When
Sir Francis was rescued and
returned home he was convinced his
name had been cursed The Unicorn’s
manifest stated that it was
carrying a cargo of rum and tobacco
bound for Europe but it was long
claimed the ship was carrying a
secret cargo

TINTIN glances at SNOWY puzzled

TINTIN (CONT’D)
What was the ship carrying Snowy

TINTIN turns another page and keeps reading

TINTIN (CONTD)
Historians have tried and failed to
discover what happened on that
fatal voyage but Sir Franciss
last words ‘Only a true Haddock
will discover the secret of the
Unicorn’

TINTIN turns the page to continue then puts the book down
and grabs another flipping through the pages

A familiar blue-suited figure sneaks between the aisles
TINTIN takes a look behind his shoulder - there is no one

CLOSE ON TINTIN is a little creeped out A storm is brewing
and rain beats on the library windows TINTIN thinks he’s
being watched Lightning strikes outside

INT 26 LABRADOR STREET HALLWAY - EVENING

vanished

TINTIN
Of course it’s gone How could I be
so stupid
EXT MARLINSPIKE HALL COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT

A faded sign indicating “MARLINSPIKE HALL” can still be read

ANGLE ON TINTIN and SNOWY hurry along in the shadows of a
high brick wall that surrounds a country estate

A full moon casts spooky shadows through skeletal trees
blowing in the wind With every gust a carpet of dead leaves
lift into the air

ANGLE ON The rusting iron gates covered with ivy

TINTIN reaches the gate he tries to open them to no avail

Suddenly SNOWY appears on the other side

TINTIN
Howd you do that

SNoWy shows TINTIN a hole in the crumbled wall

TINTIN (CONTD)
Clever boy

TINTIN squeezes through the hole with SNOWY close behind

EXT MARLINSPIKE HALL GROUNDS - NIGHT

ANGLE ON TINTIN and SNOWY cross the heavily wooded estate to
a dark mansion

ANGLE ON MARLINSPIKE HALL a once-grand chateaustyle
COUNTRY HOUSE now looking very sad and neglected Empty and
dark

TINTIN walks up to the steps

ANGLE ON TINTINS flashlight sweeps and settles on a COAT OF
ARMS carved into stone above the front door A large fish
dominates the design

TINTIN

(whispers)
A coat of arms why does that
look familiar

(realizes)
Hang on a minute that fish It’s
a Haddock Of course - Marlinspike
Hall is the old Haddock estate

SNOWY quickly heads off on in the wrong direction

TINTIN (CONT‘D)
Snowy

A slavering GUARD DOG growls and charges at TINTIN from out
of the shadows

ANGLE ON TINTIN races away from the DOG leaping fallen
trees and ducking low branches with the hound snapping at
his heels

TINTIN approaches a stone wall as the DOG is almost upon him
Suddenly SNOWY leaps from the bramble and barks angrily at
the GUARD DOG The larger dog cowers and whines submitting
to SNOWY’S ferocity

TINTIN (CONT’D)
Well done Snowy Good boy

TINTIN pets his head

The GUARD DOG playfully runs about SNOWY on the front lawn
as TINTIN unlatches a broken window and climbs inside

INT MARLINSPIKE HALL - NIGHT

ANGLE ON TINTIN slowly pushes open the window inside the
mansion and carefully sweeps his FLASHLIGHT through a
darkened room Everything is coated in layers of dust and the
furniture is covered in great white sheets A shadowy figure
stealthily walks alongside him

TINTIN moves through a door into a side room where he sees a
distinctive SHAPE hidden beneath a sheet In one swift
movement he sweeps the sheet aside

ANGLE ON The MODEL SHIP sitting in a display case bathed in
a shaft of ghostly moonlight

CLOSE ON TINTIN can’t believe his luck he grabs the
MODEL SHIP He shines the flashlight on the boat before
picking it up

TINTIN
(softly)
Well well well it seems weve
caught our thief

He starts to back away from the case holding onto the ship
He turns to see a tall SILHOUETTED FIGURE standing in front
of him the MAN raises a CANDLESTICK and whacks TINTIN on
his HEAD

THUNK

TINTIN slumps to the FLOOR head spinning The room lights
are turned on

NESTOR takes the UNICORN from TINTIN as he is lying on the
floor making sure his head is still attached SAKHARINE
enters completely cool and calm

SAKHARINE
Welcome to Marlinspike Hall I see
you let yourself in

TINTIN gets up

TINTIN
I came to retrieve my property

SAKHARINE
Im sorry - Im not sure I follow
you

TINTIN sits up rubbing the back on his head NESTOR is
holding the UNICORN MODEL

TINTIN
Oh I think you do This ship was
stolen from my apartment less than
an hour ago

TINTIN tries to get the MODEL SHIP from NESTOR - as if he’s
thinking of making a dash for it

SAKHARINE
I‘m afraid you’re mistaken Mr
Tintin

NESTOR pulls the ship back from TINTIN

TINTIN
There’s no mistake It belongs to
me

He pulls back again away from NESTOR

SAKHARINE
Are you sure

NESTOR begins to pulls the ship away from TINTIN

TINTIN
Of course I’m sure

TINTIN takes the SHIP

TINTIN (CONTD)
I took it home I put it ona
cabinet in the living room and then
Snowy chased the cat and knocked it
over and it
(dawning realization)
« fell

TINTINS eye is drawn to the mast This mast is not broken
and split like that on his own ship

TINTIN (CONTD)
(stunned)
This isn’t my ship

SAKHARINE
No indeed

NESTOR takes the SHIP back and goes back to the case and
puts it inside

TINTIN
I - I’m sorry It looks -
identical

SAKHARINE takes TINTIN by the arm and leads him out towards
the door

SAKHARINE
Well looks can be deceiving

TINTIN
Yes indeed

TINTIN pulls away from SAKHARINE and walks back to the case
and the ship
TINTIN (CONTD)
» but I don’t understand Why did
Sir Francis make two ships exactly
alike And you have one already
Why do you want another What is it
about this model that would cause
someone to steal it

SAKHARINE
Goodness me why so many questions

TINTIN
It’s my job There could be a story
here It’s what I do you see

SAKHARINE
Well it’s no great mystery Sir
Francis Haddock was a drunkard and
a hopeless reprobate He was doomed
to fail and he bequeathed that
failure to his sons

He starts to walks away from TINTIN TINTIN follows him
TINTIN
So it’s true The Haddock line is
cursed

He stops TINTIN with his cane

SAKHARINE
What else have you found out

TINTIN pushes the cane away

TINTIN
What is there to find

SAKHARINE swings the cane to TINTIN‘s other shoulder

SAKHARINE
That depends what youre looking
for

TINTIN
I’m looking for answers Mr
Sakharine

SAKHARINE

Youre looking in the wrong place

SAKHARINE offers TINTIN a THIN SMILE

SAKHARINE (CONT’D)
It’s late I think you should go
home

NESTOR hands the torch to TINTIN

NESTOR

TINTIN (CONT’D)

(reading)
“Three brothers joined Three
Unicorns in company sailing in the
new day sun will speak For tis
from the Light that Light will
dawn and then shine forth the
Eagles Cross”

Beneath that a few seemingly meaningless strokes and dashes

TINTIN (CONT’D)
What are these markings Some kind
of secret language or code It
makes no sense But it does explain
why they ransacked the flat They
were looking for this and they
didnt find it which means
theyll be back

brakes as the van comes to an abrupt stop and the LADDER
quickly extends taking SNOWY with it SNOWY falls onto the

others as fast as his legs will carry him

SNOWY hops onto passing BICYCLE and runs through a pen of
COWS before arriving at the docks and the KARABOUDJAN

As TINTIN’s crate is loaded aboard a massive ship SNOWY

the SPIRITS He unscrews the CAP as the PLANE goes into a
DIVE The PILOTS float off the floor of the COCKPIT and the
ALCOHOL emerges in the form of large GLOBULES that hover in
front of HADDOCK’s face

SNOWY floats into view and SLURPS up the ALCOHOL TINTIN
pulls the PLANE out of the dive at the last moment and SNOWY
crashes to the FLOOR and BURPS

The PLANE goes into another dive and more alcohol emerges
from the BOTTLE HADDOCK grabs SNOWY’S TONGUE and sucks it
down as quick as he can

TINTIN steadies the PLANE again and the PILOTS are knocked
out by the return of gravity The propellor comes to a stop

their own chutes and drifting into the desert

The PLANE hits a dune catches fire and comes to a stop
TINTIN is thrown through the WINDSHIELD and slides down the
nose of the plane towards the spinning PROPELLER

HADDOCK (CONTD)
Hang on Tintin I’m coming

SNOWY tries to pull him to safety but his QUIFF is trimmed
by the ROTORS

consciousness

willing to call you a failure a
fool a loser a hopeless souse
But don’t you ever say it of
yourself

HADDOCK pokes TINTIN in the chest and he falls back into his
chair HADDOCK looks at TINTIN a beat

HADDOCK (CONTD)
You send out the wrong signal that
is what people pick up Do you

about failure Tintin

You hit a wall you push through
it

TINTIN

about sending out a signal

TINTIN slaps one hand with the other

TINTIN (CONTD)
(explaining)

message from the Karaboudjan I

transmitting on

HADDOCK

TINTIN
All we have to do is send that
information to Interpol They can
track the signals and figure out
which way they’re headed

Sir Francis wanted his inheritance
to go to a man who was worthy of
it aman like himself who knows
the seas like the back of his hand

tell if one tiny island was out of
place

HADDOCK takes TINTINs meaning He leans forward and slowly
