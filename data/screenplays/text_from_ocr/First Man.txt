We hear a LOW RUMBLE

It gets louder as we hear a SCREAMING ENGINE HOWLING
WIND BURSTS of STATIC and FAINT COMMS

It SURROUNDS us filling us with dread POUNDING US INTO --

INT X-15 COCKPIT HIGH RANGE ABOVE EDWARDS AFB - DAY 1

A pair of BLUE EYES TICKING back and forth Rapidly
Ignoring the FRIGHTENING WALL OF SOUND all around us

JOE (COMMS)
Data check NEIL (0C)
2 APU on Cabin pressure is
good 3500 on 1 3355 on 2
Platform internal power

PULL BACK TO NEIL ARMSTRONG 31 in a silver pressure suit Neil
is INTENSELY FOCUSED impressive in the SEVERE TURBULENCE

JOE (COMMS)
What’s your mixing chambers NEIL (INTO COMMS)
-44 and -45

BUTCH (COMMS)
Two minute point NEIL (INTO COMMS)
MH circuit breakers on
opening nitrogren valve

Neil opens the nitrogen valve on the low tech console As the
nitrogen creates a THIN WHITE FOG in the cabin Neil looks out
the window The plane looks like a ROCKET because it is

This is the X-15 the FASTEST FUCKING AIRCRAFT EVER MADE
Hence the nitrogen Neil shivers a bit

NEIL JOE WALKER (COMMS)
Chilly Won’t be for long

We note the X-15 isn’t flying exactly it’s under the wing of
a B-52 an EIGHT ENGINE BEHEMOTH shaking more than the X-15
TERRIFYING but Neil’s calm as he’s KNOCKED about the cockpit
Neil closes the nitrogen valve

NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Precool is off Little bumpy

Classic Armstrong understatement underscored over comms by
the pilot of the B-52 (BUTCH)

First Man POST CONFORMED BLUE 2

BUTCH (COMMS)
Worst its ever been real rough up
here fluctuating a half degree each
side

But this just drives Neil into deeper focus His eyes TICK
METHODICALLY from gauge to gauge

NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Velocity 900 fps altitude 44500
igniter ready to light

JOE (COMMS)
Arm switch lite checks NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Going to prime Ammonia up

In the bumpy cockpit Neil grabs the stick

BUTCH (COMMS) NEIL (COMMS)
Twenty seconds to drop -- Rog precool on lox pump
bearing plus eight

BUTCH (COMMS) (CONT’D) NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Ten seconds -- Igniter idle ready to launch
on 3 2 1 release --

The X-15 is RELEASED from the wing of the B-52 Through the
window we see the B-52 RISE AWAY as the X-15 DROPS IN FREE
FALL A fall we feel in our gut because

WE’RE NOT CUTTING AWAY We’re gonna be IN THE COCKPIT with
Neil for this ENTIRE HEART-POUNDING RIDE

So we’re DROPPING FAST Neil pulls the throttle inboard
The rocket LIGHTS WE HEAR THE ROAR OF 57000 LBS OF THRUST

The rocket TAKES OFF Neil’s PRESSED into his seat

He grips the stick then tilts it slightly The plane
BUCKS TO THE RIGHT

JOE (FAINT COMMS)

Good on track 15 seconds NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Pulling up I’m indicating
Mach 3

Neil pulls on the stick The plane RISES SHARPLY it’s

black nickel nose glowing CHERRY RED from the heat The GLOW
lights up the cockpit extending around Neil’s legs and lap

Neil starts to sweat in the heat Heavily Sweet Jesus

Neil’s eyes TICK to the analogue altitude gauge SPINNING UP
past 150000 feet BLUE SKY NOW TURNING TO BLACK
First Man POST CONFORMED BLUE 3

NEIL (INTO COMMS)
I’m indicating 5800 pushing over

We’re over MACH 5 and we feel it until Neil CUTS the
engine JOLTING him against his harness

All is STILL Quiet The radio BUZZES but it’s far away

NEIL (INTO COMMS)

190000 feet no radio reception
setting instruments to record high
altitude flight response

A PENCIL FLOATS PAST NEIL and we realize we’re suborbital
So yeah things float Neil’s eyes move from the book to the
earth curving away below the BLACK SKY The STARS The MOON

He pauses breathes it in with BOYISH AWE and a REVERENCE
The world below seems distant and serene

NEIL (INTO COMMS)
207000 feet Top view looking
out can see an awful long ways

The radio quiets A beat then Neil notes the G-Force gauge
(G-gage) climbing up to 35 Gs

Neil FOCUSES on the G-GAGE We hear GARBLED BUZZ over comms

JOE (COMMS)
Okay 140000 feet on your way
down

The plane descends starts to SHAKES as the altitude gauge
spins down through 135000 BLACK SKY FADING AGAIN TO BLUE

JOE (FAINT COMMS)
---approaching 115000 feet should
be regaining aerodynamic controls

Little more shake Neil reaches for the stick and focusing
again on the G-gage now at 4 Gs

JOE (FAINT COMMS)
Okay right turn
First Man POST CONFORMED BLUE 4

WIND WHIPS over the plane Neil pulls the stick right but
his eyes remain focused on the G-gage

NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Sixty degree bank Climbing past 4
Gs the G-limiter should kick in

-until he notices the altitude gauge SPINNING UP 115 116
117 the sky turns from blue back to black

The shaking stops and the wind fades to eerie silence

JOE (COMMS)
---we Show you ballooning not
turning Hard right turn

Neil’s eyes TICK to the windows he PULLS on the stick

JOE (GARBLED COMMS)
altitude rising lot more
right

Neil hits a few buttons on the console

NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Didn’t appreciate the altitude I was
at increasing deflection on the
stabilizers Should be enough air
to bite into

Neil pulls at the stick again his eyes TICKING from his
gauges to the vista racing by despite his maneuver

JOE (COMMS)
Neil you’re bouncing off the
atmosphere

The altitude gauge spins up through 120000 feet

Neil struggles with the stick He remains calm but through
the windows we still see BLACK SKY the world flying by it’s
like he’s drifting off the face of the planet

JOE (COMMS)
Still ballooning Neil hard right

The speed at which the world passes the lack of control it’s
terrifying but Neil just works the problem He eyes the
altitude climbing past 140000 feet realizing something

NEIL
Air’s too thin aerodynamic controls
not responding switching to
reaction controls
First Man POST CONFORMED BLUE 5
He drops the stick squeezes the ballistic controls A burst
of gas shoots down from the left wing

TOSSING the left of the plane UP TOWARDS THE SKY

Black sky to Neil’s left the earth to his right Neil’s
banked into a 90 degree turn

---but out the window the world is still slipping by

Neil HITS the ballistic controls again a BURST of gas this
time from the plane’s nose pushing the plane’s nose DOWN

NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Decreasing angle of attack to
increase airspeed

Neil eyes the ALTITUDE GAUGE 145 146 HOLDING at 147000
FEET and then starting to fall 146 144 141

NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Coming down now

the plane starts falling FASTER 100 95 90

G-forces PRESS Neil into his seat as the sky FADES TO BLUE
The vista stops sailing by the plane finally starts to turn

The plane GROANS under the strain of the steep bank and Neil
eyes the gauges reaching for the stick

NEIL (INTO COMMS)
350 knots switching back to
aerodynamic --

Neil’s SMASHED into his seat we feel every bit of the steep
bank as aerodynamics take hold and we start turning right the
vista moving back the other way We’re also FALLING FAST

NEIL (INT COMMS)
-Surfaces bottoming out

75 70 75 Neil wrestles with the stick as we bank and FALL
at TERRIFYING SPEED

At last he PULLS the lifeless plane LEVEL Jesus

JOE (COMMS)
You seem to be in position

NEIL (INTO COMMS)
(scans his gauges)
I agree 300 knots coming down now
First Man POST CONFORMED BLUE 6

JOE (COMMS)
Can you give us an estimate of your
location

Neil eyes tick from his gauges to the window taking stock

NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Looks like I’m pretty in pretty bad
shape for the south lake bed

JOE (COMMS)
Okay working the contingencies for
a landing from the south

Neil scans the landscape for the desert runway as the plane
DIVES LIKE A BRICK towards the mountains But he knows

JOE (COMMS)
Neil there is no contingency You
need to get back to Rogers

40 35 30 Neil BEARS DOWN WILLING the engine-less plane
in The plane SHIMMIES wind BUFFETING HIM at 250 knots

JOE (COMMS) NEIL (INTO COMMS)
8 degree angle Affirmative I’m going to
jettison now

He flicks a switch a hiss as oxygen and ammonia jettison out
the rear the rear of the plane

NEIL (INTO COMMS)
I can see the base the landing will
be on south lake

His eyes DART from the distant landing strip to the altitude
gauge dropping 20000 feet per minute He closes the speed
brake handle WHITE GAS POURS from the instrument panel

JOE (COMMS)

You’re gonna have to make in a
straight in approach You’ll have
to stretch out your glide

The cockpit is FILLED with the WHITE NITROGEN GAS FOG The
gas slowly dissipates but the view is HARDLY A RELIEF

JOE (COMMS)

Neil we show you’re short NEIL (INTO COMMS)
I’m a little shorter than I
thought
First Man POST CONFORMED BLUE 7

Neil pulls the stick to hold altitude but he keeps DROPPING
9000 8500 8000 feet Fuck Its gonna be close

We see a CHASE PLANE SWING UP on Neil’s right

CHASE PILOT (COMMS)
Neil you can punch your NEIL
ventral Okay shoulda done that
sooner

Neil ANNOYED at himself HITS the ventral jettison button
The ventral fin BLOWS OFF and the plane LURCHES forward
Neil STRUGGLES with the stick 4000 3500 3000 feet

CHASE PILOT (COMMS)
Start your flaps down now NEIL
Thank you
Neil LOWERS the flaps The plane slows a bit more

PUSH IN on Neil INTENSITY BURNING 2000 1000 500 feet
Neil HURTLES past the brush JUST CLEARING THE JOSHUA TREES

CHASE PILOT (COMMS)
You’re in Go ‘head put her down

Neil PULLS UP flaring the plane It SLAMS DOWN with a BANG
SKIDS ROUGHLY across the lakebed SHAKING VIOLENTLY

Neil OPENS the back fin brakes and the plane SWERVES TOSSING
Neil and KICKING UP a HUGE CLOUD of dust until at last it
eases to a HALT

For a moment all is STILL Silent Then Neil STIRS

NEIL (INTO COMMS)

I’m down
CHASE PILOT (COMMS) JOE (COMMS)
Son of a bitch (clearly relieved)

Very nice recovery Neil
Posse will get there shortly

CHASE PILOT (COMMS)
Yeah might take a while

The period cars are cool but our eye is drawn to the X-15
The long fuselage the thick dorsal fin the NASA signage
It’s every bit as awesome as the flight we just witnessed

PUSH IN on THE OPEN COCKPIT NASA engineers take readings and
Neil makes notes UNFAZED by the flight As he gets out JOE

JOE
You okay

NEIL
Yeah

Joe looks at him probing But before he can say anything --

FLIGHT SURGEON
I gotta do his work up Joe

Joe nods Neil follows the surgeon off Joe turns back to
his jeep only to find a grizzled AIR FORCE COLONEL late 30s

COLONEL YEAGER (0C)
Kid’s a good engineer but he’s
distracted

JOE
He got home Chuck He bounced off
the atmosphere and still figured out
how to get home

The Colonel frowns His tag GLINTS in the sun C YEAGER

They’re looking for pilots with a
solid background in engineering

Neil hesitates

NEIL
Well maybe once Karen starts
feeling better It’s just-- I

BUTCH (0S)
They want a free flying trainer to
simulate a landing They haven’t
even figured out how to get there
I’m not wasting time on that

Joe walks in with STAN ‘BUTCH’ BUTCHART who flew the B-52 on
Neil’s X-15 mission Butch clutches a XEROXED MEMO

NEIL

Neil turns to his packet but Elliot anxious keeps talking

ELLIOT
Tough morning huh I barely lasted
two minutes in the ice bath Course
I suppose NASA’s probably interested
more in psychological reactions

INT CONFERENCE ROOM ELLINGTON AIR FORCE BASE - MOMENTS LATER 19

Neil sits in front of BOB GILRUTH 48 bald strong and calm
and A PANEL OF MEN including Deke CHRIS KRAFT 37 clean cut
and JOHN GLENN 40 very much the American hero and icon

GILRUTH
Neil we’ve been chatting with
candidates about the program As
you know our decision to forego
Direct Ascent in favor of a Lunar-
Orbit Rendezvous approach to the
eventual Moon mission has had a
major impact on Gemini

KRAFT
Do you have any thoughts on that
decision

NEIL
Well even considering Von Braun’s
initial criticism it seems that the
payload saved by parking the primary
vehicle in orbit and sending a
smaller ship down to the lunar
surface is well worth the resulting
risks and challenges
First Man

Neil pauses

POST CONFORMED BLUE 17

KRAFT
What do you see as the challenges

NEIL
Rendezvous and docking

DEKE
Why do you think spaceflight’s
important

NEIL
I had a few opportunities in the X-
15 to observe the atmosphere And
it’s so thin such a small part of
the earth that you barely could see
it at all When you’re down here in
the crowd and you look up it seems
pretty big and you don’t think about
it too much but when you get a
different vantage point it changes
your perspective I don’t know
what space exploration will uncover
but I don’t think it will be
exploration just for the sake of
exploration I think it will be
more the fact that it allows us to
see things that maybe we should have
seen a long ago but just haven’t
been able to until now

It’s a lovely sentiment Everyone’s impressed

Neil nods

Neil pauses

GILRUTH
Does anyone have anything else

JOHN GLENN
Yeah Neil I was sorry to hear
about your daughter

An awkward beat

NEIL
I’m sorry is there a question

JOHN GLENN
Uh what I mean is do you think it
will have an effect

INT CONFERENCE ROOM MSC - HOUSTON - DAY

GRAINY FILM FOOTAGE an NASA animated film explaining the moon

mission in basic terms

NOTES

The NASA LOGO appears as the film ends

NASA ANNOUNCER (ON FILM)
Since the time of Jules Verne man
has imagined traveling to the moon
and back But making the trip as
Jules Verne imagined -- in a single
spaceship -- would require an
enormous rocket For this reason
NASA has come up with a new
approach lunar orbit rendezvous

NASA ANNOUNCER (ON FILM)
The spacecraft traveling to the moon
would actually consist of two
separate vehicles A command ship
that will remain in lunar orbit and
a lunar lander that two crewman will
take to the surface After the men
explore the surface the lander
lifts off the moon then rendezvous
and docks with the command ship
which will take them back to earth
Thus NASA will land the first men
on the moon and return them safely
home

both taking notes look FASCINATED

The Soviets

have beaten us at every single major

space accomplishment

Our program
couldn’t compete so we’ve chosen to

focus on a job so difficult
requiring so many technological
developments that the Russians will
have to start from scratch As will
we So instead of here

(points to dots around Earth)

-we go here

First Man POST CONFORMED BLUE 20

And now he walks all the way to the right edge of the
blackboard then past it to a separate blackboard and
draws a small circle Which he labels MOON He eyes the men

DEKE
That’s to scale Check it

A tech moves to the blackboard measures as Deke continues

DEKE
If we want to get this done we
first have to prove two ships can
rendezvous and dock in space
That’s the primary mission of
Project Gemini

Deke writes RENDEZVOUS DOCKING Neil INTENT takes it down
more of that FIRE in him -- like when he saw the LLTV diagram

DEKE
Only after we master these tasks do
we move on to Apollo and consider
trying to land a man on the moon

WIDE ON a HUGE GEODESIC STRUCTURE in a hangar COLORFUL PIPES
cocooning a COCKPIT CHAIR SUSPENDED IN THREE CONCENTRIC RINGS

GUS
The Multi-Axis Trainer was designed
to replicate roll coupling on three
axes the kind you might encounter
in space

Find the Gemini astronauts walking in with Gus Deke and a SIM
SUPE Gus continues to the group

GUS
The challenge is to stabilize the
machine before you pass out

First victim Armstrong

Neil nods He walks up the steps and sits in the cockpit
chair The SUPE straps him in then starts the machine

The inner rings SPIN tossing Neil in all directions Slowly
at first then FASTER

PUSH IN on Neil The chair speeds up his head WHIPPING in

after Karen died but detached

JANET
You okay

NEIL
Yeah Just thinking about this
lecture it’s kinda neat

First Man POST CONFORMED BLUE 26

JANET
What’s neat about it

NEIL
Well it was about how to rendezvous
with the Agena If you thrust it
actually slows you down because it
puts you in a higher orbit So you
have to reduce thrust and drop into
a lower orbit in order to catch up
It’s backwards from what they teach
you as a pilot but if you work the
math it follows
(lost in it a beat)
It’s kinda neat

JANET
Yeah it’s kinda neat

That LIGHT in his eyes it’s back Janet tries not to LAUGH
Neil catches it Realizes

when you get on to the moon

NEIL
Well we’re not sure we’re gonna get
on to the moon a lot of things have
to go right before that happens

Another awkward silence Then --

MARK
What’s quarantine

NEIL
Well be in isolation To protect
in case we uh carry any diseases
from the lunar surface or something
of that nature It’s not likely
but it’s a precaution

MARK
So you won’t be here for my swim

NEIL
No I’m sorry

Does anyone have any more questions

RICK
Do you think you’re coming back

Neil looks up at him
NEIL
We have real confidence in the

but we have every intention of
coming back

Not comforting Rick’s old enough to read between the lines

RICK
But you might not

NEIL

Neil SPENT lets the throttle SLIP from his hands He flips
the switch The dust settles and we see the LUNAR SURFACE
stretching out in front of them

Neil stares BLANK Buzz is STUNNED A beat then Buzz
recovers starts powering down the LM

CAPCOM (COMMS )

Eagle has landed

An ENORMOUS CHEER goes up in Mission Control Neil FLINCHES
It’s VISCERAL something about it hits him right in the gut

CAPCOM (COMMS )

of guys about to turn blue We’re
breathing again thanks a lot

NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Thank you

Neil sits struggling to process Buzz extends a hand

BUZZ
Very smooth touchdown

Neil nods PUSH IN on his eyes deep PAIN and JOY battling
within as we MATCH CUT TO --

INT LUNAR MODULE LUNAR SURFACE - LATER 173

An EVA BOOT is pulled on over an under boot An ANKLE STRAP
is pulled tight top boot VELCRO and BUTTONS are closed

A PLSSEMU BACKPACK is lifted onto a torso METAL CLIPS at
the waist and chest are fastened to hold the pack into place

02CO2 HOSE NOZZLES (BLUERED) are plugged into suit PORTS
An RCU is clipped into place with METAL CLIPS
A PLSS HOSE and CONNECTOR is plugged into the RCU

An OXYGEN DIAL is turned up on the RCU We hear a familiar
HISS as we REVEAL --—

Neil Bubble helmet PLSS EMU and RCU on Hoses connected
First Man POST CONFORMED BLUE 112
Neil and Buzz don inner gloves checking wrist locks
Meticulous cognizant of the DANGERS on the surface

Neil uses the MIRROR on his wrist to look at the controls on
the RCU He flips a switch We hear water WHOOSH as it
circulates through Neil’s LCG

And now we hear a HISS as they pressurize the suits A beat

Buzz opens a valve We HEAR AIR VENTING OUT It’s nerve-
wracking all that air disappearing into space

Buzz kneels grabs the hatch handle rotates it counter-
clockwise and pulls but the hatch won’t budge

Buzz pulls again Struggling He stops FRUSTRATED

Neil looks at Buzz then Buzz tries again This time the
door PULLS OPEN revealing the barren surface below

All sound is sucked out and EVERYTHING GOES SILENT

Neil and Buzz STARE taking in THE WORLD OUTSIDE THE DOOR
In this moment we understand how odd how UNDENIABLY STRANGE
it is to be parked on the surface of another heavenly body

A beat Neil steps forward puts his gold visor down and
turns around to start backing out TIME CUT TO --

EXT LUNAR MODULE LUNAR SURFACE 174

TIGHT ON Neil gold visor down now as he SHIMMIES back
through the hatch onto the porch Buzz helping guide him
holding tight the LEC that serves as a safety tether

Neil steps down onto the top rung of the ladder

Neil pulls the D-ring which releases the MESA attached to the
side of the LM under Buzzs station

The MESA swings down into position and we spot the CAMERA
now pointed at Neil

Neil continues to move down the ladder He stays focused
eyes on the LADDER HANDS FEET

CAPCOM (COMMS )
Okay Neil we can see you coming
down the ladder now

Neil just continues moving down reaching the final rung
then hopping off of it to the footpad of the LM But before
turning around he quickly jumps back up to the first rung
First Man POST CONFORMED BLUE 113

NEIL (INTO COMMS)

Okay I just checked getting back
up to that first step Buzz Its
the strut isnt collapsed too far
but its adequate to get back up

CAPCOM (COMMS) NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Roger we copy Takes a pretty good little
jump
A beat then Neil hops down to the LM footpad again
CAPCOM (COMMS)
Buzz this is Houston F2 -

1160th a second for shadow
photography on the sequence camera

Neil pauses staring out A million things going through his
mind the ODDNESS of it all the DESOLATE BEAUTY The years
of work and sacrifice And Elliot And Ed

The ENORMITY of what he’s done almost OVERWHELMS

NEIL (INTO COMMS)
Im uh at the foot of the ladder
the LM footbeds are only uh
depressed in the surface about
uh one or two inches although the
surface appears to be very very
fine grained as you get close to it
It’s almost like a powder Down
there it’s very fine

(then )
I’m gonna step off the LM now

And now he steps down ONTO THE MOON oddly DISCONNECTED from
the moment the line he’s prepared

NEIL (INTO COMMS)
That’s one small step for a man one
giant leap for mankind

The COMMS FADE Neil turns taking it all in

A beat then he ties down his LEC to the ladder and steps
around the side of the LM He looks up FLIPS OPEN his visor

And now he sees the EARTH hanging high over the lunar
horizon It’s stunning

Off the look in his eyes we PRELAP --

BUZZ (PRELAP)
Okay ready for me to come out

EXT LUNAR SURFACE - MOMENTS LATER 175

WIDE ON Neil collecting a soil sample as Buzz comes down off

Magnificent sight out here

BUZZ (COMMS)
Magnificent desolation

We CUT TO --

EXT LUNAR SURFACE - LATER 176

Neil alone Slowly moving across the lunar surface He
stops Looks down picks up his foot sees his FOOTPRINT

He looks up And back behind him Catching site of Buzz
loping across the surface He looks back further Sees the
LM in the distance Impossibly fragile Off Neil CUT TO --

EXT LUNAR SURFACE - LATER 177

The lip of LITTLE WEST CRATER Visor now lifted Neil stares
into the crater Deep and vast like nothing we’ve seen

Off the UTTER BLACKNESS of the long shadows we FLASH TO --

Juniper hills The cabin Rick Janet younger carefree
And Neil With Karen All of them happy Paradise lost

We linger for a moment then FLASH BACK TO --
Neil peers into the void holds a FAMILIAR BRACELET Karen’s

PUSH IN on Neil’s eyes on the PAIN A beat Then he FLICKS
Karen’s bracelet into the crater

It flies on and on and on falling at last into the abyss

Neil’s UNABLE TO CONTROL HIMSELF A TEAR FALLS a bevy of
emotions rising to the surface All swirling round until

the TEARS COME FREELY raining down with all the pent up
feelings The first and last such outburst we’ll ever see

The thrusters IGNITE DUST kicks up as the ship ROCKS BACK
AND FORTH lifting off the surface

-and casting a LONG SHADOW as it rises

As the ship pulls away from the moon we hear familiar voices
from a television broadcast

WALTER CRONKITE (0C)

It may not be a beauty one can pass
on to future beholders These first
men on the moon can see something
that men who follow will miss

ERIC SEVAREID (0C)

Yes we’re always going to feel
somehow strangers to these men
disappeared into another life that
we cant follow I wonder what
their life will be like now The
moon treated them well How people
on earth will treat these men
that gives me more foreboding

Off the now distant moon we SMASH TO --

And in Washington an anonymous
citizen has placed a small bouquet

a note “Mr President the Eagle

short years ago

Neil walks in glances at the TV JFK’s 1962 speech at Rice

PRESIDENT KENNEDY (ON TV)
But why some say the moon Why
choose this as our goal And they
May well ask why climb the highest
mountain Why fly the Atlantic We
choose to go to the moon We choose
to go to the moon in this decade and
do the other things not because
they are easy but because they are
hard

trying not to look at the THRONG OF REPORTERS the HUGE
DISPLAY of FLOWERS and SIGNS on the lawn

--but the reporters CORNER HER as she reaches the car
NBC REPORTER

Mrs Armstrong have all your

prayers been answered JANET
Yes yes they have

She FORCES a smile

flight I could only say that it
was out of this world

Another forced smile and then she gets into the car

The NASA logo And a GLASS WALL On the other side of it in
a large room Neil stands in civilian clothes

Deke closes the door behind Janet leaving her alone with
Neil She walks to the glass He sits and she does as well

A long beat
They STARE at each other through the glass

At last Neil lifts a HAND then Janet does the same

They PRESS HANDS TOGETHER from opposite sides of the glass

And off that small ray of HOPE

that maybe they might navigate the gulf between them that
they might find a way back to each other again we

FADE OUT
