as we MOVE SLOWLY CLOSER to the castle It is completely
dark except for one room -- a study in the corner of the

castle -- which is only lit by candles

Now we are just outside a rain-splattered window of the
study We LOOK IN and SEE

INT STUDY -

An open coffin rests on a table we can not see its contents
As the CAMERA SLOWLY CIRCLES the coffin for a BETTER VIEW

Half of still clings to the waxen balm the other

half has decayed to skull Below his head is a skeleton
whose bony fingers cling to a metal box

back from the skeletons fingers The skeleton no longer

whose Hands we have just seen now carries the box to a
small table He takes a tiny key out from his vest pocket
and begins to unlock the metal box

NINE PEOPLE watch him closely They are seated on chairs
in the study waiting to hear the contents of

Beaufort Frankensteins will Their dress is turn-of-the-
century Transylvanian

Cornelius Waldman fumbles with the lock emitting strange
grunts as he tries to open it With each grunt the face
of a potential Heir is SEEN squirming with frustration
or anger

old parchment puts on his glasses coughs and sputters a
few times and then begins to read

Herr Falkstein removes the needle from the finished record

CORNELIUS WALDMAN
Herr Falkstein Did you inform
Frederick Frankenstein of this
assembly and all the particulars
of the time and place

HERR FALKSTEIN
I did sir

He takes a cablegram out from his pocket

HERR FALKSTEIN
But I received a cable only this
morning saying that he could not
come

CORNELIUS WALDMAN
Was he aware of the importance of
this occasion
HERR FALKSTEIN
Yes sir he was But he said he
was obligated to lecture at
Johns Hopkins University

CORNELIUS WALDMAN
What lecture could be more
important than the will of
Baron Beaufort Frankenstein

inheritance The estate will

HELENE

I object Herr Waldman This is a
travesty If the beloved great-—
grandson cared anything at all for

the House of Frankenstein he would
have shown it by being here with

those of us who still have some
respect I think we should completely
disregard the afterthoughts of a very
old man

20 INT MEDICAL ARENA -
DAY 20

Herr Falkstein quietly enters into the balcony of an
arena packed with young MEDICAL STUDENTS A lecture is
in progress

LECTURERS VOICE
(os)
If we look at the base of a brain
which has just been removed from
a skull theres very little of
the midbrain that we can actually
see

Cont

20 Cont

Herr Falkstein proceeds almost on tiptoe along the
aisle towards a vacant seat He is carrying a briefcase
and a small metal box

LECTURERS VOICE
(os)

Yet as I demonstrated in my
lecture last week if the under
aspects of the temporal lobes
are gently pulled apart the
upper portion of the stem of
the brain can be seen

Herr Falksteins footsteps ECHO ever so lightly against
the cold stone floor as he passes the faces of students
intense with concentration

LECTURERS VOICE

(os)
This so called brain stem
consists of the midbrain a
rounded protrusion called the
pons and a stalk tapering
downwards called the
medulla oblongata which passes
out of the skull through the
foramen magnum and becomes
of coursethe spinal cord

Herr Falkstein finds a vacant place and sits down

LECTURERS VOICE

CUT TO

ANOTHER ANGLE

Our first LOOK

Polite laughter

(os)
Which brings us directly to the
demonstration prepared for today
Are there any questions before
we proceed

MEDICAL STUDENT
(rising)
I have one question
Dr Frankenstein

at the famous Lecturer

FREDDY
Thats Fronkonsteen

MEDICAL STUDENT
I beg your pardon

FREDDY
My name is pronounced Fron kon steen

MEDICAL STUDENT
Oh I thought it was Dr Frankenstein

FREDDY
No its Dr Fronkonsteen

MEDICAL STUDENT
But arent you the grandson of the
famous Dr Victor Frankenstein
who performed such fascinating
experiments in electricity and
galvanism

FREDDY
Thats true But my grandfather
Victor was after all what we
might politely refer to asa
cuckoo

FREDDY
I prefer by far to be remembered
for my own small contributions to
science Now if we can proceed to
your questions
MEDICAL STUDENT
Well sir Im not sure I
understand the distinction between
Reflexive and Voluntary nerve
impulses

FREDDY
Very good Since our lab work today
is a demonstration of just that
distinction why dont we proceed

Behind Freddy is a PATIENT lying on an operating table

CARLSON an assistant stands near the Patient next to
a small table of instruments

Cont

21 Cont

FREDDY
What are we actually talking about
when we use the term Brain We
are talking about a cauliflower

Freddy turns to Carlson

FREDDY
May I have the cauliflower please

Carlson hands Freddy a giant cauliflower

FREDDY
If we make a small slit down the
center of this cauliflower

Freddy turns to Carlson who hands him the scalpel Freddy
makes a small slit down the center of the cauliflower

FREDDY
and then ever so gently
gently gently pull it apart

Freddy has some difficulty pulling the cauliflower apart
It begins to crumble but he goes on professionally

FREDDY
we should find with any luck
at all a stalk of celery

There is no celery inside the cauliflower Freddy flushes
red
FREDDY
(to Carlson)
Where did you get this cauliflower

CARLSON
From your office sir

FREDDY
Didnt you prepare it with the
celery before my lecture

CARLSON
Yes sir But I must have taken
the wrong one when we came up

FREDDY
(in quiet rage)
Are you trying to make me look
like an idiot

Cont

21 Cont1

CARLSON
No sir It will never happen again

FREDDY
(handing him
the cauliflower)
Here This cauliflower is useless
to me

Freddy turns back to his audience

FREDDY
With any normal cauliflower we
would have found a stalk of celery
or Brain Stem which brings us
to the practical application of
our study

Freddy moves behind the Patient on the table

FREDDY
Mr Hilltop here -- with whom I have
never worked of given any prior
instructions to -- has graciously
offered his services for this afternoons
demonstration Mr Hilltop
HILLTOP
Yes sir

FREDDY
Have we ever seen each other before
this afternoon

HILLTOP
No sir

FREDDY
Tell them

HILLTOP

(turning to the
Medical Students)
No sir -- we havent

FREDDY
(to his audience)
Do I lie
(to Mr Hilltop)
Would you be so kind enough to hop
up on your feet and stand beside
this table

Mr Hill top gets off of the table and stands erect

Cont

21 Cont2

FREDDY
Mr Hilltop Would you raise
your left knee please

Mr Hilltop raises his left knee

FREDDY
You have just witnessed a Voluntary
nerve impulse It begins as a
stimulus from the cerebral cortex
passes through the brain stem and
then to the particular muscle
involved Mr Hilltop you may
lower your knee

He lowers his knee

FREDDY
Reflex movements are those which
are made independently of the will
but are carried out along pathways
which pass between the periphery and
the central nervous system You
filthy rotten yellow son of a BITCH

Freddy pokes his knee close to Mr Hilltops balls
Mr Hilltop reacts accordingly

FREDDY
We are not aware of the impulses
neither do we intend them to contract
our muscles Yet -- as you can see --
they work by themselves

By this time Mr Hilltop has lowered his protective thigh
» a little nervously

FREDDY
Now then Modern research has
shown us that by simply applying
local pressure of blocking the
nerve impulse which can be done
with any ordinary metal clamp

Freddy reaches out his hand Carlson hands him a bicycle
clamp Freddy holds Mr Hilltops head and places the
clamp behind Mr Hilltops ears

FREDDY
dust at the swelling on the
posterior nerve root -- for oh

say five or six seconds

A short pause Freddy looks at his watch

Cont

21 Cont3

FREDDY
Why you mother-grabbing BASTARD

Freddy once again jerks his knee close to Mr Hilltops
balls This time Mr Hilltop doesnt move He is almost
ready to pass out

FREDDY
All communication is shut off
Similarly damage to a nerve will
mean that not all the impulses can
get through and there will be
weakness of a muscle
Mr Hilltop collapses to the floor Freddy never looks down

FREDDY
0or group of muscles with some
loss of skin sensation on the area
supplied by that nerve In spite
of our mechanical magnificence if
there is not this continuous stream
of impulses we would collapse
like a bunch of broccoli

A smattering of POLITE APPLAUSE Freddy reaches down and
removes the metal clamp from Mr Hilltops head

FREDDY
(to Carlson)
Give him an extra dollar

CARLSON
Yes sir

Carlson picks up Mr Hilltop and places him on the operating
table

FREDDY
In conclusion it should be noted
that more than common injury to the
nerve roots is always serious
because once a nerve fibber is
severed there is no way to
regenerate life back into it Are
there any more questions before we
leave

MEDICAL STUDENT
Dr Fronkonsteen

FREDDY
Yes

Cont

21 Cont4

MEDICAL STUDENT
Isnt it true that Darwin preserved
a piece of vermicelli in a glass
case until by some extraordinary
means it actually began to move
with voluntary motion

FREDDY
A piece of what

MEDICAL STUDENT
Vermicelli

FREDDY
Are you speaking of the worm or
the spaghetti

FREDDY
Why the worm Sir

FREDDY
Ah In science you must be very
precise -- it can spell the

difference between life and death
(to Carlson)

I dont want that fellow in class

next semester

CARLSON
Yes sir

FREDDY

He has a big mouth

(to Medical Student)
Yes It seems to me I did read
something about that incident as a
student But you have to remember
that a worm -- with very few exceptions
-- is not a human being

MEDICAL STUDENT
But wasnt that the whole basis of
your grandfathers work sir the
re-animation of component parts

FREDDY
My father was a sick man

MEDICAL STUDENT
But arent you the least bit curious
about it Doctor Doesnt the secret
of life hold any intrigue for you
FREDDY

You are talking about the gibberish
ravings of a lunatic mind

Cont

21 Cont5
MEDICAL STUDENT
Yes but sir if it could be
accomplished wouldnt that
eliminate disease from the human
frame and render man invulnerable
to any but a violent death

FREDDY
How old are you young man

MEDICAL STUDENT
Nineteen sir

FREDDY
Nineteen My dear young man
once the human organism has ceased
to function nature has deemed
that creature to be dead

MEDICAL STUDENT
But look at whats been done with
hearts and kidneys

FREDDY
Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys
Im talking about the Central
Nervous System

MEDICAL STUDENT

He holds up his scalpel

Cont

But sir

FREDDY
I ama scientist nota
philosopher

FREDDY

You have more chance of re-animating
this knife than you have of mending
a broken nervous system

MEDICAL STUDENT
But your grandfathers work sir

FREDDY
My grandfathers work was Doo-Doo
Dead is Dead Theres only one
thing I am interested in and that
is the preservation of LIFE
21 Cont6

POLITE APPLAUSE However on the word Life Freddy
has plunged the scalpel into his thigh by mistake No one
but Freddy and the Movie Audience is aware of this

FREDDY

Class is dismissed
The students begin to leave

FREDDY
Carlson

CARLSON
Yes sir

FREDDY

Bring me some surgical gauze a
little tape and some disinfectant

Freddy looks at Herr Falkstein The little Old Violinist
has finished his cheerful tune He now plays the eerie
Transylvanian Lullaby that was heard at the opening

FREDDY
How long will this whole thing
take

HERR FALKSTEIN
A week Ten days at most

FREDDY
Ill have to think it over Its
not so easy just to pick up and

Freddy stops -- the music seeping into a dark and forgotten
corner of his brain

FREDDY
Curious melody Haunting isnt
it

Freddy followed by Herr Falkstein walks back a few steps
and stands next to the Old Violinist as he plays

FREDDY
Whats that tune that youre playing

OLD VIOLINIST
Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby

How sweet Such a quaint little
tune
Freddy rubs his temples with his fingertips for a moment

Freddy examines the violin

FREDDY
Nice Nice little balance to it

OLD VIOLINIST
Ja ja

Freddy without any emotion smashes the violin over his knee
and then hands the two halves back to the Old Violinist

FREDDY
Thank you very much

The Old Violinist takes the two halves open-mouthed

FREDDY
(to Herr Falkstein)
Well if youre sure that I could

accomplish everything in a week
I suppose I could manage it

HERR FALKSTEIN
Why did you do that

FREDDY
What

I am a relative of the doctors I
came to visit him a few weeks ago
in hopes that this distinguished
member of my family might be able
to help me with a problem that Ive
had since birthand which has
caused more sorrow in my heart than
I wish on any man

ASSORTED VILLAGERS
(whispering)
Whatd he say
Relative

MONSTER
You see because of my great size
and the somewhat unusual features
of my head -- when women look at me
their first impulse is to scream
children often cry or vomit and
men are inclined to beat me over
the head

The Laboratory is silent

Cont

MONSTER
I lived in hopes of meeting people
who wouldoverlook my outward
appearance and respect me for
whatever good qualities I had to
offer If anyone had ever shown a
little kindness I would have
returned it I think at least
one hundred times over
And for that one persons sake
I would have made piece with the
whole world
Do you understand what it means --
never to see a kind or happy face
You could imagine then perhaps how
such bitterness led me at last to
the brink of another kind or life
I decided that if I couldnt inspire
lovewhich was my deepest hope
I would insteadcause fear
169 Cont1
A quiet shudder runs through the Villagers

MONSTER
But all of that happened to me a
lifetime ago And I paid for my
crimesseverely It was just
then that fate or chance brought
me to our famous doctor
I found this man to be vain I found
him to be driven with ambitions of
personal glory and consumed with an
unquenchable thirst for power But
even at the height of his quest --
this ego-driven brilliant and half-
crazed scientistalwaysalways
-held an image of me as something
beautiful
And then at the moment of truth
when it would have been easy enough
to run and stay out of dangerhe
used himself as a guinea pig in
order to give me a calmer brain
and a slightly more eloquent way
of speaking

Yes I am The Monstersometimes
known as Him or occasionally
The Creature’ But theyre one and

the same I am that tall peculiarly
attractive stranger with the winning
smile
