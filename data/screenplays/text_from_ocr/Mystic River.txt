by the cramped crowd of houses Were already PULLING
AWAY FROM the backs of two men Drinking beer smoking
Luckys and sharing a laugh An 11-year-old boy leans on a
street hockey stick watches them JIMMY MARCUS unspent
energy coiled tight in his chest His friend SEAN DEVINE
steps over holds up an orange street hockey ball

Sean wiggles the ball raises his eyebrows

EXT DEVINE HOUSE -- DRIVEWAY -- DAY

Wearing a Red Sox cap DAVE BOYLE stands eagerly before a
makeshift chicken wire goalie net as Jimmy and Sean whack
away at the orange ball with their street hockey sticks

across from them A dark plain Plymouth The DRIVER gets
out Crewcut white shirt and black tie a gold badge and
cuffs clipped to his belt buckle

Theres another man in the passenger seat Hard to make
out through the watery reflection of trees in the glass
Hard to tell whether hes wearing a priests collar or a
turtleneck The kids look at the badge The Driver crooks
a finger at them wriggles it toward his cheat until they
step over

DRIVER

Bawling Dave climbs in
The Driver points a finger at Jimmy and Sean

DRIVER (CONTD)

flashbulbs pop Whitey looks in jots notes An assistant
MEDICAL EXAMINER is down on his knees looking at
something Plus a platoon of uniformed troopers and
Boston PD blues

A BABY-FACED COP stares away from the action being
comforted by his partner as Sean passes on his way in

BABY-FACE

Sean sees the blood already circled on the steps
leading down A path is made for him As he reaches the
door Whitey looks back meets Seans gaze looks ten
years older

Seans view widens as he sees between the ME and CSS
tech A body is scrunched there the space between the
walls no more than three feet wide

Katie Marcus sits with her back against the wall on the
right her feet pushed up hard on the wall to the left
Like a fetus in some horrific womb

A torn sock hangs around her left ankle a simple black
shoe with a flat heel is on her right foot Her jacket is
torn her pants mud-stained

Blood is everywhere Like a red rain its in her hair
dots her cheeks stains her clothes in red strings

Katies knees are pressed to her chest her right elbow
propped on her right knee a clenched fist up by her ear
trying to keep some awful sound at bay Her eyes are
clenched shut as tight as her fist

Stop it just stop it the body says Stop it please

Sean steps in crouches Whitey fills the space behind
him

WHITEY
That her

As gently as he can Sean uses his forefinger to move
back a heavy strand of hair He looks at Katie a moment

SEAN
Yeah

WHITEY
Well have the father do a positive at
the morgue

MEDICAL EXAMINER
Bloods from a split on the crown of her
head She was beaten with some kind of
stick But that didnt kill her She was
shot a second time Looks like a 38

cops weight Another cop helps hold him

JIMMY (CONTD)
You find her Is it her Is it

Sean is motionless He holds Jimmys eyes with his own
locking them until Jimmys surging stare sees what Sean
has just seen And he knows its over his worst fear
realized

And Jimmy screams Love and rage in equal quantities It
shreds the birds from the trees It ECHOES into the Pen
Channel Ropes of spit shoot from his mouth Screaming

Sean turns away looks back in at Katie Its awful

possible motives youre not left with

much

SEAN
If this Marcus thing was random I mean
shit

WHITEY

Tell me about it But the old lady
Prior she didnt hear a scream She
heard a gunshot and before that a hi

the curb Not too fast or she wouldve
hopped it Foot comes off the clutch she

stalls
WHITEY
She says hi guy shoots her
SEAN
She slams her door into him makes a run
for it
WHITEY

But what makes her swerve without hitting
the brakes

SEAN
Something in the road

WHITEY
Maybe Look Marcus girl couldnt have
weighed more than one-ten How hard could
she have hit the guy to get a head start
into the park

SEAN
Either he wasnt back on his heels or he
doesnt weigh so much himself
WHITEY
Which explains the footprints Three of
hers None of his

SEAN
It did rain Brendan Harris couldnt be
much more than one-fifty

WHITEY

the tears from his face Ray Signs something to his

And Sean starts to walk toward his car still talking on
the phone laughing And as the SOUND FADES OFF we HOLD
ON the sidewalk on the names written so long ago

DISSOLVE TO
FOOT TRAFFIC

On the sidewalk People lining up And we TILT UP TO the
Buckingham Day Parade Floats color guard politicians
in convertibles Over it all

JIMMY (VO)
I killed the wrong man This is what Ive
done and I cant undo it

ANNABETH (VO)

INT JIMMYS HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- DAY
Annabeth steps up to Jimmy starts to unbutton his shirt

ANNABETH (CONTD)
I want to hear your heart

She places an ear to his chest Jimmy nearly cant
breathe under his burden We hear the PARADE OUTSIDE

ANNABETH (CONTD)
Last night when I put the girls to bed
I told them how big your heart was

JIMMY
Annabeth --

ANNABETH
I told them how much you loved Katie
Because you created her and sometimes
your love for her was so big your heart
felt like it was going to explode from
loving her
JIMMY
Please stop

ANNABETH
I told them their daddy loved them that
much too That he had four hearts and
they were all filled up and aching with a
love that meant we would never have to
worry

Annabeth pulls off her own shirt presses herself to him

ANNABETH (CONTD)
I told them their daddy would do whatever
he had to for those he loved And that is
never wrong That can never be wrong No
matter what their daddy had to do

JIMMY
You knew

ANNABETH
Celeste called looking for you Told me
about Dave Told me what she told you
Said she was worried something might
happen

She kisses his throat starts to undo his belt

JIMMY
Why didnt you call

ANNABETH
Because theyre weak

JIMMY
Whos weak

ANNABETH
Everyone Everyone but us We will never
be weak And you You could rule this
town

A beat as Jimmy stares at her And then he kisses her
Hungry for this woman His woman Passion builds
precipitously As she returns it between breaths

ANNABETH (CONTD)
And Jim After Lets take the girls
down to the parade Katie wouldve liked
that

Jimmy lifts her up She hooks her legs around him
EXT PARADE -- DAY

It streams along Sean stands watching with his wife
Lauren and his baby daughter A float passes by filled
with children who shout laugh and wave

All except for one whos lost sad haunted The childs
eyes find Seans for just an instant and then hes gone

ean snaps from the sudden trance looks across the
treet at Jimmy Annabeth their daughters and a few of
he Savage brothers Waving at the parade happy and
trong

nutnN

Suddenly aware of being watched Jimmys head swivels
His eyes lock on Seans Jimmy gives Sean the smallest
smile

And Sean points a finger gun Drops his thumb on the
imaginary hammer

And as Jimmys smile widens

FADE TO BLACK
