INT BEDROOM —- NIGHT

DARCY (V0)

I can tell you one thing with
absolute certainty At some point
today every single teenager across
the globe was thinking about sex

CLOSE ON hands as they collect objects from around the room -
a BOOK on TEENAGE SEXUALITY SEXUALLY EXPLICIT TEENAGE
MAGAZINES and the KAMA SUTRA The hands put the items into a
DESK DRAWER

DARCY (VO)
And I am no exception I touched
myself twice today and it wasn’t to
apply my make up But
sexintercoursefucking -
that’s a whole different ball game
And I am determined to take a path
less travelledI plan to over-
ride human nature and what my body
and the rest of the world is
telling me to do - fuck screw
hump nail hit bang pork - have
sex

We move up the desk A BOOK of SHAKESPEARE lies open next to
a JOURNAL

PAN UP to DARCY a pretty smart as a whip brunette as
she sits at her DESK staring at something

DARCY (VO)
And why am I depriving myself of
one of nature’s little luxuries
Because as far as I can tell sex
is neverjustsex

Reveal Darcy is looking at a FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH of herself and
what looks like an older sister

VIVIAN (0S)
Darcy Get your vagina up here

Darcy hides her journal closes ROMEO AND JULIET climbs out
her bedroom WINDOW and goes up to the ROOF

EXT ROOFTOP OF FAMILY HOME —- JACKSONVILLE ARKANSAS - DUSK

Darcy joins VIVIAN a proud gay boy with flo dyed
bangs and baby pines dns presses Zo himself in’ phiqne
ECLECTIC VINTAGE who is laid back on a RUG watching GINGER retching over the side of the house Ginger - a more
than plain looking blonde - is trying too hard in a MICRO-
DRESS and HEELS
GINGER (0S)
My heart is racing at least double
what it should be I’m gunna faint
or throw up Seriously

DARCY
-it’s Celebrity Worship Syndrome
It can be as bad as a drug
addiction

GINGER
No Darcy I will not let you
cheapen my feelings

DARCY
-it’s in your DNA You’re
programmed to follow the alpha male
of the village

GINGER
I don’t give a shit I want to have
his babies and the rest of the
village can kiss my Flintstone ass

Vivian stands up - eyes wide in awe

VIVIAN
Oh my Godhe’s here

Darcy and Ginger turn to see an enormous MOVING TRUCK
followed by a posse of luxury CARS drive down the street and
towards the brand spanking new MANSION HOUSE at the end of
the cul-de-sac A TV REPORTER and CAMERA CREW stationed at
the end of the street jump into action as the cars drive by

a GINGER
This is the most important moment
in my life

Ginger turns to Vivian they clasp hands and SCREAM

DARCY
Youre both embarrassingly
pathetic

They climb off the roof and through to Darcy’s bedroom where
the same news reporter is on E NEWS on the TV

START OPENING CREDITS

E NEWS PRESENTER

Teen heartthrob and notorious
playboy Jason Dawes’ latest

pursuit
E NEWS PRESENTER (0S)

INT DARCY’S HOUSE KITCHEN — CONTINUOUS

DARCY
(sarcastic
Only the most important person in
the world EVER

Darcy sits down to put on her SNEAKERS she actually laces
them UR May beautiful sexy and confident enters
dressed in a POWER SUIT and HEELS

She carries a WELCOME BASKET with a card on the front that
reads ‘The Town of Jacksonville welcomes the Dawes family’
and has the stamp of the MAYOR’S OFFICE on it

BILL
Mary Anne’s daughter described him
as a hot piece of ass

DARCY
Don’t even go there
MAY
Boys don’t bite Darcy A couple of
dates wouldnt hurt

Bill still in goggles accosts May and starts biting her
neck and ears like a monster

DARCY
Jason Dawes is an egotistical
heedless pop star and I am not
beholden by any desire to have my
inexperienced emotions raped by a
hormone-driven adolescent on the
guest for some dire form of puppy
ove

May smiles sarcastically

BILL
You might always be able to explain
it my love but you won’t always
be able to explain it away

MAY
I hear he’s a bit of a player
Maybe he could be one of your
projects

Bill who is now nuzzled in May’s cleavage pulls back in
terror

BILL
ARGHH A third nipple

MAY
Bill

Darcy smirks picks up the basket and follows after the
others

EXT DARCY’S HOUSE —- NIGHT

Ginger and Vivian sit in a beat up HONDA CIVIC that’s parked
in the driveway MUSIC blares

Darcy who is dressed like she’s forty in JEANS straight from
the 80s and a dowdy woollen SWEATER climbs into the driver’s
seat and shoves the BASKET onto Ginger who is spraying
PERFUME down her pants

Darcy reverses out the drive drives down the street about
400 yards until they reach THE MANSION HOUSE
EXT JASON’S HOUSE -— CONTINUOUS

The TRUCK is parked in the sweeping driveway and REMOVAL MEN
carry FURNITURE and BOXES into the house Ginger touches one
of the CHAIRS as if its sacred and the guy rolls his eyes
VIVIAN
(to Ginger)
Should we go up to the door

GINGER
Yes No Yes My vagina is blocking
out all rational thought

Then Levi a cute but shy boy walks down the drive
towards the truck and sees them

LEVI
I’m guessing you guys want to meet
Jason

GINGER

Shit sorry Yes if possible I
mean we totally understand if he’s
busy

Levi carries the basket back into the house Ginger and Darcy
turn to Vivian
GINGER
You just shot your load

VIVIAN
Well lick it up bitchOh my God

The FRONT DOOR opens Vivian and Ginger freak out and run
behind the TRUCK leaving Darcy alone

A boy of 19 comes into the DOORWAY His looks could have come
straight from the catwalk (think LUKE GRIMES) he sports
multiple TATOOES and his style is a throw back to 1960s mod
fashion -— STRAIGHT CUT PANTS WHITE SOCKS and a SKINNY BLACK
TIE This is JASON DAWES

Dawes takes off his SHADES and looks out to the van - to
Darcy

Darcy sheepishly puts up a hand to wave But Jason turns and
goes back into the house

Ginger and Vivian race back

GINGER
What the fuck Why did he go

DARCY
Why do you think

They turn in embarrassment and walk back to the car

GINGER a

That was the most horrific thing

that ever happened
VIVIAN

(to Ginger)
It didn’t happen to you Miss
sensitivity it happened to Darcy

GINGER
She doesn’t care though right

DARCY
That a self-obsessed drug-addict
playboy doesn’t want to speak to
me Hmmlet me think

They banter as we fade out to

EXT BELMONT HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
FINISH OPENING CREDITS

Darcy parks and makes her way through the school grounds
Teenagers a couple of them who are obviously PREGNANT stand
huddled in groups singing along to their favorite Dawes
tracks SKIRTS are short and LIP GLOSS is aplenty - and that
goes for the teachers as well

A NEWS TRUCK is parked near by a nervous TV PRESENTER
practices her lines and a huge BANNER is draped across the
entrance that reads ‘WELCOME HOME JASON’

ROGER (think Christopher Mintz-Plasse) the worst kind of
geek because he thinks he’s George Clooney approaches her

ROGER
Darcy You heard that Jason Dawes
is starting today

DARCY
No He is

ROGER
I used to go to pre-school with
him

DARCY

(sarcastically impressed)

Really

Vivian jumps off the BUS and joins them

VIVIAN
Friends Romans Countrymen

DARCY
(under her breath)
z come to bury Jason not to praise
im

Vivian smirks

ROGER
So yeahif you need a way in
Id be happy to introduce you

DARCY
Thanks Roger But I would rather
peel off each of my finger nails
and dip my hands in acid
(shouts to the Principal)

Sir Just a minute

Darcy runs after PRINCIPAL COLLINS a short balding man
who is scurrying towards the news reporter

ROGER
(confused)
That‘s an extreme way to get his
attention
DARCY
Principal Collins the fund-raiser
is three weeks away so I’d like
permission to utilize one of the
empty classrooms and start
meaningful promotion

PRINCIPAL COLLINS
Permission granted You know Jason
Dawes is starting today

DARCY
Yes Sir when you introduce him
to the school I think you should
try to hold back on the adulation

PRINCIPAL COLLINS
Come now I’m hardly going to

DARCY
-Because you are the dominant
male in our environment As soon as
you revere him it will trigger
others to follow and turn our
already confused society upside
own

PRINCIPAL COLLINS
Don’t worry my dear Darcy There
will be no gratuitous worship from
my lips

He walks off Hold on Darcy unconvinced

INT SCHOOL HALL — LATER
Close on Principal Collins

PRINCIPAL COLLINS
In 1985 I was fortunate enough to
be present when President Ronald
Reagan presented Mother Theresa
with the Medal of Freedom

Darcy is sitting at the back scribbling answers to
MATHEMATICAL EQUATIONS in her MATH BOOK

PRINCIPAL COLLINS
And now I have the blessed honor
of introducing a truly gifted
artist a man that needs no
introduction and whom I am so
humbled to meet

Darcy looks up and sighs

PRINCIPAL COLLINS
Mr Jason Dawes
Everyone gets to their feet in rapturous applause Darcy has
to stand so she can see his entrance

We see Terrell his BODYGUARD first - a large black man
standing by the door Then Jason walks in eyes lowered
Jason stands at the MIC and talks with a raspy voice

JASON
Thanks Yeah I’m pleased to be
hereThanks

He waves and walks away Principal Collins almost bows as he
walks past

INT CLASSROOM —- DAY
The class is already in full swing when Jason comes in

TEACHER
Welcome Please take a seat

Darcy looks at Jason who is now sitting at the end of the
same row She notices the TATTOO on his arm lines of text
that look like a poem and his LEATHER WRIST BAND Darc
covers her MICKEY MOUSE WATCH with her sleeve Jason glances
at her and she looks away

TEACHER
Many people believe that it’s the
world’s greatest love story Hands
up if you agree

Everyone shoots their hand up except Darcy and Jason The
teacher looks to Darcy for an explanation

DARCY
Id say it’s the world’s greatest
dust story

WES a good-looking football-playing womanizer
interrupts

WES
Like you’d know anything about
that

A boy next to him high fives him The class sniggers Darcy
can feel Jason’s eyes on her

rey)
bee Darcy
You don’t thi ox they were in love

DARCY
(shyly)
Well lust is the increase of the
chemicals oestrogen and
testosterone to promote mating

(MORE)

DARCY (contd)
Attachment and bonding form the
basis of love and Romeo and Juliet
didn’t have time to do either So
surely it had to be lust

TEACHER
(to Darcy)
Less science Darcy Back it up

DARCY
First he can’t live without
Rosalind then he sees and chases
after Juliet and both declare
their love for each other — which
is based on physical attributes
only - by the end of the first
night It was impetuous

JASON
I agree

Everyone looks at Jason He speaks shyly his eyes down

JASON
I think maybe they got married just
so they could have sex And sex is
just lust right

Darcy shakes her head at the immature remark

GIRL AT THE BACK
(about Jason)
Youre the expert

The class sniggers

TEACHER
No more personal comments lets get
back to the text Who can cite me
an example of

Darcy looks over to Jason He’s looking down but flashes a
look at her She turns away

EXT SCHOOL — DAY

huddle waiting for Jason At the side of the school we find

Darcy sitting outside a CLASSROOM MR WRIGHT (think
RYAN REYNOLDS) the clean cut but undeniably sexy math
teacher is standing opposite her There’s an obvious
chemistry between them

DARCY
Don’t dance around it Just tell me
what you think

MR WRIGHT
It was goodThe theory was a
little clumsy in places but the
arguments were strong

Darcy puts her hands through her hair in frustration

MR WRIGHT
Don’t beat yourself up This is
years ahead of where you’re
supposed to be

DARCY
Only according to our failing
school systemWhen did you first
master Topography

Wright doesn’t want to say Darcy guesses

A frustrated student steps out of the classroom

You hiding from the fans It’s
okay I find your music mediocre at
best

Jason sits down at a DESK and pulls out his CELL A RADIO is
playing really bad ROCK MUSIC Jason looks up at it with
distaste A young male voice comes over the airwaves

DI Embarrassingly that was music from
Belmont’s véry own Thrashing Ravens
who’‘ll be playing at our annual
fund-raiser in three weeks time
And here to tell us all about it is
the chastity belt behind the ‘Say
Yes to No’ campaign Darcy Daniels

Jason looks at the radio

DEVON
That’s Darcy She has a one thirty-
eight IQ

He indicates over to a PYRAMID-SHAPPED STRUCTURE at the side
of the room

DEVON
That’s her three-dimensional model
of the Fibonacci sequence Awesome
isn’t it I spoke to her once

JASON
Shut up

DARCY (0S)
The event is to raise awareness
about STDs teenage pregnancy and
the dangers of alcohol and drugs

DJ And for those of us who couldnt
care less about the aforementioned
issues tell us why we should

Darcy pauses Jason smirks Darcy speaks quickly and with
little skill

DARCY (0S)
Because two thousand one hundred
teenagers will become pregnant
today alone The US teen
pregnancy rate continues to be one
of the highest in the developed
worldmore than twice as high as
rates in Canada

DJ That’s riveting stuff

JASON
This is her thing is it

Kindergarteners As long as it is
age appropriate I think it will
only benefit our youngsters

Darcy comes in and sighs when she see’s the TV

MAY

(on screen)
Whilst I respect those that want to
delay sexual activity it is
irresponsible to leave children in
ignorance when we know that nearly
half of fifteen to nineteen year-
olds are already engaged in it

(to herself)
I need to get my roots done

The TV switches off May looks around and Darcy is holding

Darcy looks at her under her eyebrows

MAY
Just because I don’t agree with you

admirable The unpopular road isn’t
the easy one

Whoever saves one life saves the
world entire

One man’s medicine is another man’s

Darcy closes her eyes He gently kisses her neck His touch
makes her breathless She can hardly resist

her breast She opens her eyes and then looks into his eyes

events Jason performs and the
money goes to your charity

DARCY
Are you serious Do you know
anything about this boy He
epitomizes everything we’re
against

GINGER
But he’s willing to do it for free

DARCY
Yes of course That’s the whole
point

GINGER

(to Vivian)
So a little birdy told me

DARCY
Does the gossip ever stop

BILL
You know gossip used to be a
necessity There was a distinct
evolutionary advantage to knowing
someone would run you through with
a spear

GINGER
Thank you Bill

Darcy glares at her Dad and he smirks and goes inside

GINGER
As I was saying a little birdy
told me that Jack Daniels hasn’t
invited Saskia to Say Yes to No

DARCY
Talking about him in code is still
talking about him

GINGER
You‘re gunna have to speak to him
at some point So far we’ve
organized the whole thing without
the main attraction being involved
He might do something reckless we
need to keep an eye out

DARCY
Trust me if he steps out of
line

VIVIAN
I’m gunna ask Levi to be my
date

Darcy and Ginger stare at Vivian

DARCY
What Seriously This is major

Jason There are no secrets between

side and he’s wearing a JACKET that’s too big

ROGER
I believe and correct me if I’m
wrong that you don’t have a date
to the fund-raiser

Darcy is stunned
ROGER

So I thought it appropriate that I
take you

Darcy glances at Jason who’s smirking and looking away

ROGER
Obviously I am very aware of your
strict morals and codes of conduct
so I am pleased to re-assure you
that I am also a virgin

Jason moves his chair to hide his snort of laughter Roger
turns to look at him smiles and turns back to Darcy

ROGER
It would be mortifying for you to
go alone and I think it’s important
that we show the world that even
girls like you that don’t put out
can still get laidI mean dates

Darcy is trying not to die from humiliation She looks at

Roger very seriously

DARCY
Roger thank you so much for your
kind offer

ROGER

I do have some protection just in
case the moment takes us

DARCY
»eBut I’m afraid I must decline

Roger raises a questioning eyebrow

ROGER
Okay I get it Say ‘no’ now and
then say ‘yes’ later when I ask
again

DARCY
Roger II promised m dying
Grandmother that I would not date
until I was twenty-one

ROGER
Really okay I understand Just
know that when the time comes I
will be here

He gives her a warm smile and leaves Jason walks over to
her

JASON
I didn’t think you told lies

DARCY
It doesn’t say that on the poster

JASON
So

Darcy takes a deep breath She’s rehearsed this

DARCY
Ive been meaning to apologize for
my harsh words last time we
spoke -I appreciate the commitment
youve “made to the fund-rasier and
your publicist’s assistance Weve
sold a lot of tickets

JASON
Good Is there anything else you
need me to do

DARCY
Yes if you could work with the
three boys from the band Try and
make them sound musical - I don’t
want this to be a total Dawes-fest

JASON

Jason stares at her and she can’t help looking into his eyes
She turns and picks up her things

DARCY
And keep your dick in your pants
until it’s over

He smirks as she walks out

the dangers of drink drugs and
unprotected sex

Destiny looks at Jason and laughs

DESTINY
I knew there was a reason we moved

Mountain)
I wish I knew how to quit you

Ginger smiles sincerely and Roger leaves Darcy’s perplexed

DARCY
What was that about

GINGER
I forgot to say He’s taking me to
‘Say Yes to No’

Darcy almost chokes

DARCY
Tell me youre joking

GINGER
Look I know he’s no model but he’s

interests

DARCY
By that you mean the adulation of
Jason Dawes

GINGER
And other things

DARCY
You can’t do it he’s moronic

GINGER
Well Im sorry he’s not good
enough for you Luckily you’re not
the one dating him

She gathers her things together and stands

GINGER
Not all of us want to be virgins
for the rest of our lives

She walks out Darcy watches her go

king issued an official order to
‘Fornicate Under Command of the
King’

He hesitates
JASON

I don’t knowMaybe fortyor
fifty Maybe

DARCY
Wow
Beat
JASON
I’m sorry
Beat
DARCY
If you have this amazing life that
so Many people would kill forwhy
do you take drugs
JASON
Honestly
(beat)
Because when no-one else is there
you can always rely on them to make
you feel great
Beat
JASON
Kats nice I didn’t know you had a
sister
DARCY

No-one does

JASON
So what’s the deal with her

DARCY
She was drinking and sleeping
around She got pregnant Mom got
her an abortion but then she fell
for this meth addict and within a
year she was hooked and then got
arrested for dealing Mom was
running for office at the time and
had to step down

(MORE)

DARCY (contd)
The scandal was hushed up but could
have ended her careerMom and dad
spent a fortune bailing Kat out and
putting her through rehab But she
came out and went straight back to
the drugs They haven’t spoken to
her since When I started Belmont I
just didn’t tell anyone I had a
Sister It was easier

JASON
But your mom and dad know you see
her

DARCY
Dad knows Mom would crucify me
She can’t risk the scandal and
doesn‘t believe Kat’s changed

JASON
You‘re a good sister

DARCY
I just don‘t want to lose her
There’s a bond between siblings
that means you have to be there no
matter what don’t you think

Jason takes it in

It starts to RAIN Darey quickly gets into the car Jason
stays sitting on the HOOD Darcy beckons him in but he
ignores her

Darcy watches as he closes his eyes and tilts his head up to
the sky and lets the water fall onto him

DARCY (VO)
News just in Love is officially
and scientifically blind Feelings
of love lead to a suppression of
activity in the areas of the brain
controlling critical thought

Jason jumps off the car strips off his TEE and starts to
unbutton his PANTS Darcy stares at him in shock

When he’s down to his briefs he runs into the field arms wide
and smiling He stops and looks back at Darcy

DARCY (V0)
This basically means that when we
get close to a person our brains

ecide that the need to assess
their character and personality
isn’t so important and we suddenly
find it difficult to make negative
judgements

Darcy takes a breath and then gets out the car strips down
to her UNDERWEAR and runs over to him

She’s hesitant and then relaxes They run and fall through
the field laughing Jason puts her over his shoulder and runs
around smacking hér ass and screaming like a warrior

DARCY

The crowd mummers Darcy turns to the back and Jason walks
through a door at the back of the hall

The murmurs grow louder as the news of his presence spreads
through the hall and out to the corridor

Jason waits for the crowd to hush

JASON

You all know my reputation And I
dont excuse it Yesterday I had an
STD test and I wont know all the
results until tomorrow So right

JASON
I’m proud of you

KAT
(still watching the TV)
What’s the maximum number of people
he could have infected

DARCY
Well the girl’s saying they slept
together three months ago

Terrell
And he probably sleeps with a
different girl every week

DARCY
So that’s thirteen other girls

KAT
And lets say they are half as
promiscuous as he is so each girl
infects a new guy every two weeks

DARCY
Exponential growth Two to the
thirteenth Two to the eighth is
two-fifty-six

Darcy scribbles the numbers on a piece of PAPER

DARCY
Five-twelve ten twenty-four

twenty forty-eight) forty ninety-
six So it’s eighty-one ninety-
two

TERRELL

That’s a lousy model though
Its probably more like Fibonaccis
rabbits

Darcy and Kat stare at Terrell in amazement

DARCY
(over excited)
Oh my God It is So they wait four
weeks after getting infected and
then start infecting other people
at two week intervals

Darcy scribbles some more equations

DARCY
Six hundred and ten
(to Terrell)
You‘re my hero

Terrell shrugs modestly

TERRELL
I liked math

Darcy high fives Terrell and Kat Jason coughs to remind them
of his presence

FLASHBACK - Darcy and Jason watching the fireflies

There’s a noise from outside and she quickly hides the poem
as Jason climbs through the window

JASON
Hey

DARCY
Hey

He sits at her desk He seems conflicted

DARCY
Are you okay

JASON
Sure

DARCY
What’s up

JASON
Nothing

She‘s not convinced and walks over to him He has his head
down and she stands in front of him and strokes the back of
it He closes his eyes for a moment and takes a deep breath
When he opens his eyes he looks at her bare legs

He reaches out a hand and runs it up her leg to nist
underneath her nightdress Darcy looks down at him

He uses his other hand to pull her closer to him She doesn’t
resist He presses his head against her and runs both hands
up her legs She can hardly control her breathing

His hand moves up between her legs and she takes a sudden
intake of breath He watches her as he touches her She
closes her eyes and tilts her head back in pleasure

He stops and they stare into each others eyes He stands up
and kisses her Then he pushes her back onto the bed They
kiss He hikes her leg up and runs his hand up her thigh He
kisses her neck and moves lower to her breasts

But then suddenly stops himself Darcy is aroused and
breathless and looks down at him

DARCY
What’s wrong

JASON
I can’t do this

DARCY
What I want to

He stands up He notices her HARVARD APPLICATION on the desk
Jason paces in frustration

JASON
You know what they wrote about when
I beat up that photogra herThe
gay had to drink through a straw
or a week and all they reported on
was how long it would take for my
pinky to heel

DARCY
That‘s them Not you

JASON
Who the fuck do you think I am
Darcy Last summer I stayed up for
six days straight I had an ounce
of cocaine and four bottles of
vodka My nose bled for two days
That’s what I do I fuck things up

DARCY
You’ve changed

JASON
Jesus you think you can change
everybody don’t you

Darcy looks down Jason sniffs - he’s wired again

Y¥
You don’t have to act the way your
mom and everyone else expects you
to

JASO
Yeah Yeah Well they expect me to
fuck and now it seems you do too
So lets fuck then Come on You
wanna screw a rock star Yeah

He pushes her back onto the bed lifts up her nightdress and
pulls down her PANTIES

DARCY
No Jason stop it

Darcy finally ashes him off her and he stumbles backwards
and almost falls He’s dizzy and disoriented He stares at
her - BLOOD dripping from his nose

DARCY
Sex doesn’t have to be just sex

He turns and climbs out the window Darcy sits breathless and
shaking staring out into the night

INT DARCY’S HOUSE - KITCHEN —- DAY

Darcy sits at the DINING TABLE half heartedly eating some

food Bill is recounting a story that requires lots of OTT
facial expressions and funny mimes that would usually make
her laugh - but not today

DARCY (V0)
They call it ‘falling for someone’
for a reason Becausé when it
happens you have absolutely no
control of yourself Nature picks
yeu up and pushes you off the

ighest platform and watches you

tumble down and down and down
And there’s no safety net So you
betta hope there’s someone down
there waiting to catch you

Close on Darcy staring into space

INT STAFF ROOM -— DAY

Darcy and Mr Wright sit in the corner drinking COFFEE The
room is empty otherwise Darcy is distant She watches him
crack his NUCKLES

MR WRIGHT
So we could have purified it ina
sodium NTA column to get it up to
ninety- nine percent but that would
only have been suitable for
biochemistry not oral
administration

DARCY
Romeo and Juliet - love or lust

MR WRIGHT
Lust - without question

DARCY
Right Although you could argue
that the rush of dopamine and
oxytocin that you ex erience when
falling in love could explain their
spontaneous decisions It could
have been the first throws and
well never know if it would have
progressed further

MR WRIGHT
Youre making the case for the
spontaneous and irrational What’s
brought this on

DARCY
I just

Principal Collins comes in and interrupts them

PRINCIPAL COLLINS
Should you be in here Miss Darcy

Darcy gets up to go Mr Wright taker her hand when Collins’
back is turned

MR WRIGHT
(quietly)
Seriously though If for any
reason you weré experiencing those
feelingsjust don’t let them lead
you astray

Darcy looks unsure

MR WRIGHT
It’s just biology You know that
right

DARCY

Of course

She smiles and walks out Mr Wright watches her go Then gets
up and follows after her

He nearly bumps into Mrs Jenkins on his way out
MRS JENKINS

ame But people in the business

unimaginable bullshit that just
came out of your mouth

JASON

Darcy tries to walk away but her temper draws her back around
to him Rage bubbles inside of her

DARCY
How dare youYou stand
thereyou stand there with my
friend’s blood on your hands and
tell me that you want to be with me
- even though it goes against every
fiber of your being

JASON
I didn’t mean that

DARCY
Well may I now take the
opportunity to tell you why dating
a violent egocentric temerarious
Grop-out might pose a problem in my
world Or are you too blinded by
ego to comprehend anyone other than
yourself

JASON
I was trying to be nice

DARCY
Nice Nice Nice as incongenial
sympathettc or decent Because as
elementary as it is I don’t think
you understand the word especially
after what you did to Vivian

JASON
Vivian

DARCY
Do you have any idea how hard it is
to be gay in high school But he
finally finds someone and summons
the courage to be with him and you
stepped in to warn Levi off him
didnt you

JASON
Yes and I don’t regret it

DARCY
Really And you had me thinking you
were a good brotherI knew
exactly what you were the first
time I saw you Mr Wright even
warned me about you but I was just
swept alon ra your bullshit with
the rest of them

Jason walks up close to her

JASON
How close are you and Mr Wright
exactly

DARCY

What is that supposed to mean

JASON
I think you know what it means

Darcy goes to slap him but he catches her wrist and holds it
tight She tries not to show that it hurts
They are very close and stare into one another’s eyes in
defiance She speaks in almost a whisper
DARCY

You think youre so special with

your issues and your drugs but

really you‘re just a pathetic

addict who’s had sex fifty times

and still has no clue how to make

love

mistake of my life
INT DARCY’S HOUSE —- DAY

May looks to Bill with regret and has to sit down

INT JASON’S LIMO —- DAY

DARCY (V0)
Sometimes we do things and we don’t
even know why we do them To lash
out react rebel or just feel
wanted But these actions have
consequences

JASON
(to the driver)
Take a left here

The limo swerves around the corner

INT MR WRIGHTS HOUSE —- DAY

Mr Wright is packing his things into BOXES He has the TV
with Darcy on in the background but doesn’t look at it

gave away something precious that I
was saving for someone I loved

The DOORBELL RINGS and Wright goes to answer it

Wright I’m arresting you “for the
sexual abuse of minor Katherine
Daniels from the years 2003-2006
You do not have to say anything

EXT DARCY’S HOUSE —- DAY

The journalists are completely silent now - hanging off her
every word

SLEAZY JOURNO
(softly)
Go on

Darcy takes a breath

DARCY
When it comes to sex you don’t
have a take back It’s forever

(MORE)

DARCY (contd)
And that doesn’t just mean the
disease or the baby that you are in
no way ready for It takes a part
of you that should only go people
you love and when roe really want
them to have it Abstinence doesn’t
mean forever It just means not
yet Regrets are hard to live with
It would be nice if we could all
have less of them

JOURNALIST
And what about Jason Dawes And
your campaign

DARCY

I think Jason is absolutely right
Abstinence is sexybut staying
safe is more important than just
saying ‘no’ One man’s medicine is
another man’s poison

(beat)
And as for the campaignI thought
I had all the answers but it seems
facts and figures don’t always
teach us everything we need to
know Sometimes youve got to trust
yourself and take a chance on the
unknown

qhe journalists push in with more questions and Darcy answers
them

GATES are closed and the LIGHTS are off She watches the
FIREFLIES dance in the grass

INT CAR- DAY

Every single thing we do eat feel
or dream is a biological reaction -
it’s science telling us how to
behave as though it has a plan for
us

INT CAR — DAY

an inappropriate word for the way I

She takes his hand in hers

I can tell we can try to control it
but sometimes a gust gotta let
mother nature ta 2 s course
