INT ALS APARTMENT DAY

ALICE (cleanly beautiful late 20s) finishes making the bed
(only mussed up on one side) in her perfect ascetic
apartment She has a single photo of Debbie Harry on the
wall Everything is in black and white

In the kitchen-- puts the single cereal bowl and spoon in the
dishwasher Behind her we see a white board with a to do
list buy dish soap Say yes to dates Try not to intimidate
boys

She deftly packs a clutch with perfectly mini-sized supplies-
tiny lip gloss small tissues crisply folded twenties and a
small joint Her manicure is perfect She grabs her keys

INT LUCY’S APARTMENT DAY

LUCY (disheveled and sexy late 20s) slams the hem of her
dress in the bathroom door Her place is cozy Art piled
up Pages of the graphic novel scattered Bohemian style-
quilts a cake plate with different slices displayed In the
process of becoming homey- boxes still unpacked

Her pantyhose are artfully arranged hanging on nails on the
wall She chooses purple ones and throws them on snagging
them on the way-- but it’s late

INT LUCY’S CAR CONT

She peels out of the drive blasting the Bangles She adjusts
the rear view mirror while applying eyeliner merging and
singing along with the Bangles She trips up on the words and
starts Google-searching the lyrics on her phone Her manicure
is well we can’t really call it a manicure at all

INT AL’S CAR DAY
Al sets a gift wrapped in Crate and Barrel paper on the
passenger seat She plugs in her iPod Checks all mirrors

Plugs her blackberry into the charger Buckles up THEN
starts the engine Deep breath she shifts into drive

EXT HOTEL PARKING LOT DAY

Lucy parks badly and dashes in Really badly

INT SINGLE’S TABLE- CONT

Band of misfits Handshakes and polite nods all around Lucy
waves her champagne glass at a distant waiter Alice scans

and finds the LITTLE BROTHER of the Bride dancing He picks
up the flower girl and spins her around He’s adorable Blows
a yellow bubble of gum and the flower girl pops it with her
finger Lucy smiles softly LITTLE BROTHER catches her eye
smiles back sexily

INT SMALL VENUE BAR

Jack brings over two beers The venue is already full
Everyone is a freaky carbon-copy hippie Al looks like she
walked out of an Abercrombie catalogue next to them Jack
gives her the drink She refuses it
AL
It’s just-- everyone enables these
musicians to act like babies
because they think that’s what
artists are like- they’re
irresponsible I’man artist I

have a job

JACK
Maybe you should be doing less of
the responsible job thing and more
of the artist song-writing thing

AL
If nobody sings your songs you’re
not a songwriter

JACK
When are you gonna sing me one of
your songs

AL
Have you ever heard my voice
There’s a reason why But I can
out-song-write any of these hippie
babies

and is much higher than all the other women on couches
armchairs It’s not a place where you sit on the floor

JESSIE (CONTD)
This month we’re swapping clothes

JILLIAN
Twice in a week

She hugs her

JILLIAN (CONTD)
I brought that dress Just didn’t
fit me once I started working with
my trainer and I lost a ton of
weight Should fit you perfectly

AL
Uh thanks

JILLIAN
Try it on

Jillian clearly expects Al to try it on in front of her Al
uncomfortably pulls the dress over her clothes Al struggles
with pulling her shirt off while wearing the dress Lucy
helps Al get the shirt off

LUCY
I haven’t seen these locker room
changing skills since junior high

They struggle throughout the conversation

AL
Is that a hickey

LUCY
Yeah Bad date last night He had
an ironic mustache

AL
Oh that means he’1l never commit
Mine drank gin which means he’d be
shitty in bed

Jamie approaches trying on a blazer

JESSIE
Jamie Meet Alice and Lucy

AL mumbles from inside her shirt

JESSIE (CONT’D)
What happened with Peter Pan Man
last night

JAMIE
So I text him that I can’t make the
art opening and he replies
“Fuckles LOL”

JESSIE
Fuckles is kinda cute Ooh a
backless crop top Here Lucy

JAMIE
I think Fuckles killed it for me
(checking out a hot dress)
And I hate that I have to wear a
she-suit every day

JESSIE
If you refuse to date a Jewish
lawyer I guess you gotta BE one

LUCY
Thank you sister for reminding us
of the only reason to get a job

JAMIE
Listen I don’t refuse it’s just
that in my humble and self-hating
opinion Jeff Goldblum is the only
doable Jew and I’m not sure that
opportunity will present itself

Brandy (late 20s gentle Southern accent black quick smile
quick words) joins them She dumps clothes on the couch and
gets busy- it’s called a Naked Lady Party for a reason Al
emerges looking good in the dress

JILLIAN
That looks the cutest on you

JESSIE
One woman’s trash is another
woman’s treasure

JAMIE
Now if only Jessie could have my
Fuckles guy since she thinks it’s
adorable like Alice has Jillians
dress

AL
Yeah if only dating could be this
simple This city is a man-desert

JESSIE
You’re all single Discuss

With that quip of brilliance she and Jillian yenta their way
over to the other side of the room The singletons are left

BRANDY
It’s so true And I moved here with
my man Too bad he was so far in
the closet he had one foot in
Narnia

Ouch
BRANDY
You moved here from New York
right I should set you up with
Martin from my basketball league
He’s from New York

JAMIE
You know you might like my friend
Matt He’s so sweet

LUCY
We should be swapping dudes instead
of Theory cardigans Think about
it Every girl has that one guy
she’d never date for whatever
reason but she knows he’s a good
guy he’s not an asshole he
doesn’t blog-

BRANDY
He’s straight

AL
He’s employed Perfect for one of
your friends

JAMIE
Yeah so why do we have to sift
through all the rejects We SHOULD

AL (CONTD)

Jack Hale is 29 grew up with me in
New York and abandoned med school
to transfer and pursue public
health at UCLA He’s convinced he’s
making a braver choice by treating
the American health care system
instead of individual patients but
I think he got scared by the job
Anyway He’s smart reliable but
also a big mush pile sometimes
He’s my best friend

Lucy notes this Maybe a little wounded She covers it well
