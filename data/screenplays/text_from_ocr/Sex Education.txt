OPENING CREDITS ROLL over clips from assorted sex education
films of all ages races and styles The blunt the louche
the stilted and coy clips from the noughties from the
forties from India and from France All trying their best
to explain this most basic human function

CREDITS END on a cheap oversaturated eighties example
All tinny synth music and crap video effects In a lurid
disco a boy and a girl dance woodenly

PULL OUT from the video to reveal an old-fashioned biology
lab Tall wooden benches cast iron retort stands anda
class full of cynical self-conscious sixteen year-olds
stifling giggles as they label anatomical diagrams

At the back ARTHUR POTTS small messy and ink-stained
appears to be studiously taking notes Close up we see that
he’s pasted his vagina diagram hand-out into a scrappy art
book and made it the core of a drawing of a naked woman
bent over peering up seductively He adds a speech bubble
‘Ooh Arthur touch me on my labias’ He proudly looks
across to share it with best mate THOM BARTON Shy anxious
and gazing absent-mindedly at OLIVIA HARPER in the next
row Pretty gauche and colour-coordinated she lazily
paints her nails with pink highlighter

ARTHUR
(sotto)
Maybe if you took her to the
discotheque

Thom snaps to caught out embarrassed pleading innocence

THOM
What Why

ARTHUR
(nodding to the screen)
Do a little dance make a little
love Touch her jub-jubs

os
POTTS

Arthur swivels to attention The video has been paused by
MR SCHRICTER tall vulpine and imposing a man in love
with his position rather than his job

MR SCHRICTER
Quick quiz What occurs
immediately after ejaculation

Arthur stammers bewildered Without prompt Thom covers
his mouth dips his head and whispers
THOM
Heart rate regulates

ARTHUR
Err your heart rate regulates

THOM
Endorphins released from brain

ARTHUR
And dolphins are released from
the brain

The class erupts with laughter Thom winces casting a look
of disbelief at his friend Schricter privately takes note

MR SCHRICTER
(to the class)
Shut it
(to Arthur)
We just watched the video What
were you doing

Schricter marches over and picks up Arthur’s art book
showing it to the class The cartoon is met with universal
disgust and derision Thom withers tainted by association

MR SCHRICTER (CONTD)
Very artistic Detention

Arthur just shrugs petulantly Mr Schricter spots this

MR SCHRICTER (CONTD)
And this stays with me

Arthur looks genuinely panicked

ARTHUR
But Mr Schricter

MR SCHRICTER
‘But Mr Schricter’ Right Who
else What happens after
ejaculation

A few hands go up Thom’s does not Mr Schricter ignores
the sea of straining arms looking straight at him

MR SCHRICTER (CONT’D)
What about Rain Man over there
Come on Barton help us out

THOM
(mumbles )
I don’t know sir
MR SCHRICTER
Cant hear you Stand up

Thom half gets to his feet head bowed

THOM
I don’t know sir

He sits straight back down

MR SCHRICTER
See I think you do know I think
youre just too shy and delicate
to want to take part in my class
(off the kids’ laughter)
Is that it Are you a shy little
mouse

Thom goes bright pink and just stares ahead

MR SCHRICTER (CONTD)
Well we’ll just have to wait

Schricter folds his arms and perches on the edge of his
desk The class groans and stares daggers Thom sweats

MR SCHRICTER (CONTD)
Maybe we should rethink that
medical school application Hell
of a doctor you’1ll make if you
shit yourself every time someone
asks you a question Or do you
just need someone there to hold
your hand Is that it Here

Schricter takes Thom by the hand Thom blurts out

THOM
Endorphins are released from the
pituitary gland

MR SCHRICTER
He does know A miracle Praise
be to Allah

Thom goes to sit but Schricter won’t let go of his hand
MR SCHRICTER (CONTD)
And what else Come on Something

morephysical

THOM
Thethe

MR SCHRICTER
TheThe
THOM
The penis becomes flaccid

The class explode like shrieking babooons

CLASSMATE
Your penis is flaccid

The class roar again Thom looks around in disbelief

THOM
What Shut up

CLASSMATE
What you saying it’s not flaccid
Sir Thom’s got a lob on

Howls from the class Thom is burning red dying inside

MR SCHRICTER

Alright alright

(Thom looks relieved)
That’s enough about Thom’s boner

(to Thom)
Correct Well done No doubt
gleaned from a long succession of
hot and heavy one night stands
is that right

He smirks Already uncomfortable Thom catches Olivia’s eye
and reddens even further

MR SCHRICTER (CONTD)
You’re not at med school yet
Play your cards right and you
could piss your life away in
Woodford just like your little
mate here

The bell goes Instantly kids jump up gathering their
bags Schricter shouts halting them instantly

MR SCHRICTER (CONTD)
Sit down Thanks to Barton and
Potts we’ll all be staying into
break You can thank them later

Thom just closes his eyes against the angry glares

INT SCHOOL CORRIDOR - DAY

Hordes of kids rampage through the school’s austere
corridors where oak panels bear the names of decades old
team captains and scholarship recipients (blank since
1971)
Though clearly once an institution of some standing now
the high ceilings are peeling and the oak panels are
covered in notices petitions and anti-drug posters

Thom and Arthur march along trying to ignore the angry
looks comments and ‘accidental’ shunts of their peers
Thom sports a dated and faded wide-lapelled corduroy jacket
over his standard-issue school shirt and tie

ARTHUR
I definitely heard ‘dolphins’

Thom doesn’t respond He’s in a mood

ARTHUR (CONTD)
Hey I’m the one who got his book
nicked

THOM
It’s just a stupid art book Get
another one If I dont get into
Imperial thats my whole life
fucked

ARTHUR
(clearly offended)
It wouldnt have happened if you
hadn’t been perving up Olivia

THOM
I wasn’tI don’t fancy Olivia
okay I was just thinking about
something

ARTHUR
Thinking about how badly you want
to suck her tits

Breaking into a smile Thom goes to kick Arthur up the arse
but he laughs and runs outside

EXT SCHOOL GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS

The boys spill out into the vast green spaces of this grand
old schoolyard passing WESLEY an effortlessly handsome
kid and his mob of similarly styled acolytes hanging out on
the steps Arthur gives Wesley a ‘cool’ cocked-gun finger
gesture as he passes but it’s entirely ignored Arthur
tries to style it out Poorly Thom smirks

THOM
What was that

ARTHUR
What We’re in the same art set
(quickly owning up)
(MORE )
ARTHUR (CONTD)
I’m gonna get us an invite to his
big end of term party

THOM
Why would we want to go to Wesley
Dean’s party

ARTHUR
(tentatively)
Justmight be fun We could go
andtake the piss or whatever

THOM
Won’t be fun It’ll be a bunch of
overgrown kids running around
playing kiss chase while you and
I have to sit in the corner
talking to each other all night

ARTHUR
Oh cheers

The boys slump down on the plinth of a crumbling statue

THOM
Listen we’ve got less than a
year left in this place Take out
half terms and weekends it’s 183
days Let’s just keep our heads
down stay out of the spotlight
and get through it Then it’s no
more Schricter no more kids’
parties no more of this
playground bullShit Battrani

Thom and Arthur feign a sudden interest in the statue’s
plaque but it’s too late CHAZZ BATTRANI has spotted them

CHAZZ
Alright benders Guess who’s
swung an invite to Wesley’s
party S’gonna be the mash-up of
the century innit Wall to wall
jelly-bucket All just waiting
for some boom boom pow

(‘casually’)

CHAZZ

THOM
Jealous of you fingering your

CHAZZ

THOM
(to Arthur)

He’s not one for the foreplay

CHAZZ
Suck a bollock Barton Nice

(a grand beat)
For a paedophile

THOM
Clever

Arthur leaps in outraged but clearly enjoying the drama

ARTHUR
Chazz That was his dad’s jacket

Thom looks to the floor embarrassed Chazz looks suitably
humiliated too but can’t back down

CHAZZ
So What I didn’t know did I

He cuffs Arthur on the ear

ARTHUR
What What was that for

Arthur cuffs him back As they fight Thom looks up to see
Olivia apparently walking in his direction He panics

THOM
Errguys

CHAZZ

THOM
Guys

They look up and spot what Thom’s seeing Olivia Harper
definitely now heading straight for him

THOM (CONTD)
Hellooo
OLIVIA
(light disdain)
Alright I just got sent by the
head She wants to see you

THOM
Oh yeah That old witch

He snorts but dies a bit inside Chazz and Arthur smirk

CHAZZ
SoOlivia are you going to
Wesley’s thing

She turns surprised to be addressed by the loser

OLIVIA
Yeah Why
(with disbelief)

CHAZZ ARTHUR
Yeah Maybe

THOM
(too forceful)
No No I mean we could go but
I don’t know we probably wont
Just not really our sort

OLIVIA
(bit insulted)
Why not What’s wrong with it

THOM
Well no it’1l be good it’s just
that y’know you get a lot of
losers don’t you All sort of
prancing about to Girls Aloud or
some crap Drinking blue WKD and
crying on the stairs

OLIVIA
What’s wrong with WKD

Chazz and Arthur cringe

THOM
No Nothing It’s nice
Fizzyit’s justso Miss
Daniels wants to see me now Like
right now I should probably

Thom slings his bag over his shoulder and hurries off
Arthur and Chazz are left smiling vacantly at an
unimpressed Olivia
INT MISS DANIELS’ OFFICE - SCHOOL - DAY

A cramped musty office filled with books and dying plants
An obese bored old woman MISS DANIELS sits squinting at
a document through her half moons pen in hand In front of
her sits Thom

MISS DANIELS
This doesn’t say who you’ve
chosen as your personal tutor

THOM
I havent picked one yet

MISS DANIELS
Do it soon Without a glowing
personal reference this form’s a
waste of time Now interests

THOM
Erm I like readingmusic

MISS DANIELS
Very controversial GCSEs

THOM
8 A stars 3 As

MISS DANIELS
Do you have a girlfriend

She hovers a pen above the paper Thom stammers flustered

THOM
Erm Well No not at present

She peers at him saying nothing

THOM (CONTD)
I mean y’know I’ve had
girlfriends Not girlfriends

kissed girls andstuff if
that’s what they mean A girl
But y’know not just kissing
All sorts Is this on the form

A flicker of a dark smile crosses her face

MISS DANIELS
Nope

Thom blushes and gazes at her in utter angry confusion

MISS DANIELS (CONTD)
Now are you a member of any
school societies Chess Club
Library Bunch Young Inventors

Thom squints at her with growing indignation

MISS DANIELS (CONT’D)
You play the piano weren’t you
in the band years ago What
happened there

THOM
They painted band queer on my
locker my bag and the tops of my
shoes

MISS DANIELS
(utterly unmoved)
Right so you don’t participate
in school life at all You’ve got
nothing else to offer

THOM
Other than 8 A stars and 3 As

She removes her half-moons and sighs onto a lens

MISS DANIELS

From a pile of over 4000
applications Imperial accepts
around 300 medical students per
year Theyve all

(reading from his form)
‘wanted to be a surgeon for as
long as they can remember’ and
they all have the 24-carat GCSEs
Good grades aren’t enough any
more They want all-rounders

Thom’s jaw hangs at this terrible revelation

MISS DANIELS (CONTD)
Mr Chandos is auditioning for the
school play You could do that

THOM
I couldnt I literally couldn’t
do that

MISS DANIELS
Why

THOM
One - ‘play queer’ Two - I’m
just I’m not good
withattention There must be
something else Anything

MISS DANIELS
Have you ever considered
voluntary work

Thom sighs in resignation Then a ghost of a smile

THOM
Can I bring a friend

EXT STATELY HOME - GARDENS - EVENING

A well-heeled garden party A large banner reads ‘ACT on
Arctic Conservation’ Thom and Arthur stand behind a bar
in front of a huge ice sculpture of a polar bear They wear
waiter’s uniforms - black trousers white shirtsand
furry polar waistcoats

ARTHUR
Just admit it Say ‘I love Olivia
Harper I want to kiss her and
hold her and dickslap her
bangers’

A shocked reveller hands over two empties Arthur takes
them and then points to the floor in horror

ARTHUR (CONTD)
Shit look at that

Thom and Arthur duck beneath the bar out of sight They
neck the dregs from the empty glasses whispering

THOM
Shut Up I don’t like her

ARTHUR
I don’t know why you’re so
embarrassed She’s quite fit
They bob back up wiping their mouths
THOM
She’s justI dunno She’s such

ateenager

ARTHUR
Youre a teenager you anus

Before Thom can respond

ARTHUR (CONTD)
Holy shit amole

Arthur grabs two full glasses of champagne this time They
duck down for two seconds then resurface looking distinctly
giddy Giggling As they regain their focus Arthur is
struck by what he sees He nudges Thom

ARTHUR (CONTD)
Shit The Bed

Thom filling up glasses of red wine looks up to see a
heart-stoppingly pretty woman EMMA early thirties being
talked at by an overbearing older man She laughs politely
like she’s had to do it her whole life Thom swallows

THOM
Wow I meanfuck

He’s overfilled one of the glasses Arthur drunkenly grabs
for it but only succeeds in knocking it over Thom’s
waistcoat Thom swiftly whips off the waistcoat and checks
his shirt for damage

THOM (CONTD)
Shit Do you think they’1ll charge
me Arthur

But Arthur’s back staring at the woman

ARTHUR
She’s like that Monica Bellucci
butreal You’ve gotta go and
talk to her

THOM
What

ARTHUR
You have to When do we ever meet
women like that That’s like six
months of wanking material just
speaking to her

THOM
Why don’t you go and talk to her

Arthur looks at Thom - ‘as if’

THOM (CONT’D)
Well what am I going to say to
her ‘Hi my friend and I were
just saying how fit you are Will
you come and talk to us so we can
pop it in the wank bank’

ARTHUR
Err no You’re a waiter Offer
her a drink

Thom gapes - stuck for an answer to that
ANGLE ON Emma smiling professionally at a couple
MAN

Emma were off Thank you
though Listen I’m sorry but

In the background Thom nervously walks past the group He
makes to interjectand bottles it He tries to back away

EMMA
--completely understand I’1l
just twist your arm twice as hard
next year

As they leave she turns to catch Thom reversing away He

tries to escape but it’s too late

THOM
Yes Hello I was just I saw
that you didnt have a drink and
soanyway I wondered if youd
like one A drink

Emma smiles patiently amused at the young mans front

EMMA
Well Its an A for effort and an
E for technique there Thanks for
the offer but I’m spoken for

Thom double takes his jaw drops like Guy Goma

THOM
What No I didn’t

She delights in his discomfort

EMMA
Yeah yeah Course you didnt
Its actually my event though so
let me

She turns to where Arthur stands polishing glasses and
attempting to see what’s going on She gestures to him
glasses of champagne over here’ Arthur looks stunned

EMMA (CONTD)
Youre a bit young for this crowd
aren’t you Are you one of the
new VentureCorp boys

‘two

Thom stammers unsure how to respond as Arthur arrives with
a tray of drinks

EMMA (CONT’D)
Oh thank you

(to Thom)
Is champagne okay

THOM

Oh absolutely

(to Arthur)
Thank you

Arthur looks at Thom ‘what the fuck’ Thom shrugs back
bewildered

ARTHUR
Youre welcome Sir

Arthur slowly backs away head cocked straining to hear

EMMA
So what do you do at VentureCorp

THOM
What do I do What do I do At
VentureCorp What do I do I
(gives up the pretence)
I don’t know I’m not really

EMMA
Huh Tell me about it Sometimes
I wonder what I’m doing too

Arthur reverses back into shot brandishing a tray of
drinks craning to hear

EMMA (CONT’D)
Sorry I didn’t get your name

THOM
I’m Thom With an aitch

EMMA
Emma Emma Schricter

A CRASH from behind as Arthur drops his tray of glasses
She offers a business card Thom looks at her in shock

THOM
Emma Schricter Cool Cool

Arthur fumbles across the floor trying to pick them up but
only causes more disruption

THOM (CONTD)
(‘nonchalantly’)
Is thereis there a Mr
Schricter

Emma raises an amused eyebrow - he’s very forward
EMMA
And that’s an A star for
persistence

Again Thom reddens She touches his arm reassuringly

EMMA (CONTD)
Nice to meet you Thom

and moves off leaving him dazed flustered and a little
bit in love

EXT LEAFY STREET - NIGHT

A bedraggled Thom and Arthur stumble home Thom takes the
business card from his pocket Arthur grabs it

ARTHUR
Oh my God She loved you She
totally wants to do you

THOM
It’s just a business card

ARTHUR
With her number on It’s a ‘do
the business’ card

Arthur looks pleased with himself Thom rolls his eyes

ARTHUR (CONTD)
It’s a ‘Monkey Business’ card

THOM
Finished

Arthur thinks

ARTHUR
Jizzness card

THOM
Good So

Arthur stops Thom in his tracks
ARTHUR

You should totally fuck sir’s
wife

THOM
And thank you

ARTHUR
I’m serious She was practically
foaming at the muff She thought
you were like a real bloke

THOM
And again

ARTHUR

She gave you her number You’ve
got to do this Why should an
arsehole like Schricter get to
have sex with a vision like that
while guys like us have to rush
home just to catch the freeview
on Channel X

THOM
Guys like you

ARTHUR
Fuck sir’s wife

THOM
No

ARTHUR
Do it

THOM
Shut up

ARTHUR
Do her

THOM

You better hurry up or you’1l

The pair bicker on into the darkness

INT CLASSROOM - DAY

Thom and Arthur sit at the back On the whiteboard is
written 2nd TRIMESTER Schricter speaks as he writes

MR SCHRICTER
Weeks 13-27 Vernix begins to
cover the foetus which

A loud hip-hop ringtone cuts him off He swivels eyes like
skewers ENOCH neanderthal school hardnut scrabbles in
his bag and grabs his phone

But too late - Schricter swoops snatches it off him
glances at the screen and answers

MR SCHRICTER (CONTD)
Hewwo Jennifuh Diss is Enoch
torkin

The class roar with laughter Enoch scowls mortified

MR SCHRICTER (CONTD)

Thom and Arthur laugh along Enoch picks Arthur

ENOCH
Oi shut up prick

As Mr Schricter picks Thom

MR SCHRICTER
I know Mr Barton Imagine how
exciting it’d be if a girl wanted
to talk to you on the phone

Thom blushes as the class snigger

MR SCHRICTER (CONTD)
You could take her out on the
town in your swanky new jacket

Mr Schricter whips the jacket off the back of Thom’s chair
and tries it on for size He plays to the gallery
strutting about foppishly

MR SCHRICTER (CONTD)
What do we think Me

Cackles from the mob Thom stews darkly

INT ARTHUR’S BEDROOM - DAY
CU on Emma’s business card now well thumbed

Thom sits on Arthurs bed staring at it The bedroom is a
messy playpen Posters on the wall scalextric on the
floor drawings cartoons and caricatures scattered about
Arthur talks as he rummages under his bed chucking out old
toys as he hunts

ARTHUR
She gave you her card she’s
expecting your call It would be
rude if you didn’t call I think

As Arthur ferrets he chucks a Buckaroo set on the bed
beside Thom Thom picks it up Arthur catches him smirking

ARTHUR (CONTD)
What I just havent got round to
chucking them yet Here

Arthur hands him the phone Thom looks doubtful

ARTHUR (CONTD)
Come on We can do it together

Debbie Silton wed been accepted
for a manned mission to Mars

THOM
We were just kids

ARTHUR
Yeah I know And you’re ‘sick of

Thom contemplates this It has a certain appeal

THOM
I justI’m not good on the
phone I get

ARTHUR
Youll be fine Just be doing
something else while you’re
speaking Bounce a ball or
whatever Something to

INT ARTHUR’S BEDROOM - LATER

Whilst carefully loading up a Buckaroo Thom holds the

Arthur thrusts his kids’ blackboard under Thom’s nose On
it he’s scribbled ‘LOVED OTHER NIGHT WANT KNOW MORE’

THOM (CONTD)

INT SCHOOL CHANGING ROOMS - THE NEXT DAY

Thom (in his pants) and Arthur (in his speedos) towel off
Behind them boys spray entire cans of Lynx over themselves

ARTHUR
My towel smells like Edam It’s
like rubbing Edam in my hair

Thom snorts A kerfuffle - boys hastily cover up and loudly
complain - as Miss Daniels enters

MISS DANIELS
Calm down the lot of you I’m not
wearing my glasses I need to see

sports hall

She spots Thom and halts

MISS DANIELS

THOM
(to Miss Daniels)
Exactly Yeah I hate penguins

Arthur and Miss Daniels stare at him like he’s mental

MISS DANIELS
I might just tell them you

Thom just stares at her Punching himself internally

MISS DANIELS (CONT’D)
Well Youll need to find
something else for your form

still needs numbers for the play

Arthur smirks at Thom’s misfortune

INT CORRIDOR —- DAY

Thom stares at a door gathering himself A couple of kids
push past him and into the school theatre to reveal Wesley
standing on stage warming up his voice over-enunciating
each syllable

WESLEY
I like yogurt pots in New York

Thom can’t do it As he walks away he spots Olivia and two
friends approach and go in

He chews it over for a moment Looks around to make sure no-
one’s watching And follows her

INT SCHOOL THEATRE - DAY

He gingerly closes the door behind him It makes the
slightest noise Instantly a shriek from the stage

MR CHANDOS
WONDERFUL

Thom flinches and turns Everyone is staring at him MR
CHANDOS stands in the centre of a cross-legged circle of
students Over-earnest he’s clearly seen Dead Poets
Society once too often

MR CHANDOS (CONTD)
Hello and welcome Another lamb
to the slaughter Jump up and
join in

Thom fights the urge to flee He walks to the stage and
clambers up as Olivia raises a hand

MR CHANDOS (CONT’D)
No need to put hands up in here
Does this look like a classroom

Thom edges round the circle clumsily trawling for a gap
No-one budges

OLIVIA
Ermwhat’s the play

Hes forced to sit cross-legged just outside the circle

MR CHANDOS
The piece is called The Knifes
Tale It’s my own work but for
today I’d thought we’d improvise
these auditions See how you
react without a script OK

Thom’s eyes close Oh Jesus no

MR CHANDOS (CONT’D)
So give it your best shit And
thats another thing Youre here
to express yourselves So if you
feel it if you feel like saying
shit or fuck or whatever say it
Everyone Shit

EVERYONE
(unenthused)

Shit

MR CHANDOS

MR CHANDOS

Great stuff

Thom stares into his crotch willing a stroke
JUMP CUT TO

A quick-fire series of improvised vignettes Thom is
faltering awful and living his nightmare Olivia cringes
in the stalls Mr Chandos and Wesley furiously overact at
each other Chandos throws Thom improv curveballs he’s
forced to act out or react to

INT THOM’S HOME - EVENING

Thom steps into a small dark hallway

THOM
I’m home

He waits for a response Then sags slightly when none
comes The house is empty

INT KITCHEN THOM’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

He switches on the light A post-it note sits on the table -
‘DINNER IN FRIDGE AT WORK IF YOU NEED ME LOVE YOU’

He opens the fridge door which we see is festooned with
Thom memorabilia certificates and badges He pulls out a
ready meal then opens the microwave also covered in
report cards rosettes and photos of Thom

As the machine quietly starts humming he checks his watch

INT THOM’S MUM’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

A chintzy grown-up room An old photo of his parents at an
eighties wedding sits on the dressing table Thom opens a
wardrobe revealing a rack of men’s clothing some bagged up
for Oxfam He hesitates then flicks through He removes a
tuxedo and holds it up to himself He stares at his
reflection in the floor length mirror

EXT NEW BOND STREET LONDON - EVENING

Thom in ill-fitting dinner jacket ruffled shirt and bow
tie walks down Bond Street visibly intimidated by his
high-end A-list surroundings He stops outside Sothebys
adjusts his outfit and takes a deep breath

INT THE GRAND HALL SOTHEBY’S - MOMENTS LATER

He walks into the imposing hall And freezes White with
panic Not one other person is in black tie

Arthur busy waitering spots him His eyes widen he
breaks away and heads for Thom He makes a play of offering
the canapes and whispers --

ARTHUR
What the fuck have you come as

THOM
Oh my God That’s it I’m going

ARTHUR
No Come on It’s fine You look
like James Bond Stay think of
the penguins

He smirks looking Thom up and down

ARTHUR (CONTD)
I know I am

Arthur laughs guiltily as Thom makes to leave

THOM
Right I’m off

EMMA (VO)
Thom

Thom swivels and sees Emma heading for them Horror

THOM
Mrs SchrEmma Hey Hi
(to Arthur)
No Listen I don’t want a vol au

Arthur takes a second to catch up then shuffles off

EMMA
Sorry Volunteer staff - you get

Wow Love the tux Very smart

THOM
Well y’know you spend all day
in a suit events like these it’s

an effort

She smiles intrigued and amused The sound of laughter
inappropriately interrupts their exchange It’s SIMON
Emma’s boss pretending to be enjoying their conversation

SIMON
Yes Wonderful Ha ha ha How are
we How are we Good

He slips a patronising arm around Emma still ‘laughing’
SIMON (CONTD)
Emma eight no-shows How do we
sell art to absentees
EMMA
It’s still a decent turn out I’m

sure we’ll be fine

SIMON
Well we better fucking be

He laughs his way off to glad hand another group

EMMA
My boss

THOM
He seems really nice

Emma smirks but before she can respond

vO
(cod Italian accent)
Emma Bellissima Ciao

OLLY (portly oily late 30s) kisses Emma twice eyeing her
hungrily

OLLY
You look radiant

EMMA
Not as radiant as your lovely
wife I notice How did you
manage that one

OLLY
Same way I manage my investments
I see something I want I go for
it I get it And what’s marriage
if not an investment

Emma forces a laugh and glances at Thom who raises a
conspiratorial eyebrow Following Emma’s glance Olly turns
and notices Thom He drains his glass and hands it to him

OLLY (CONTD)
Aah Perfect timing Could I get
a refill

An awkward moment Thom hovers Emma looks mortified

EMMA
Actually

THOM
(interrupts)
Of course

Thom shoots Emma a coy smile - ‘it’s fine’ She returns a
grateful one as he slips off

INT THE GRAND HALL SOTHEBY’S - LATER

hall watching as guests shout bids for a watercolour
Arthur sidles up next to him bottle in hand They speak
but never look at each other

ARTHUR
How did it go

THOM
Awesome Her friend mistook me
for a waiter

The auctioneer brings down the gavel at ten thousand
pounds The guests applaud the winner A new lot opens - a
modern art piece a misshapen baby doll with umbilical cord
and a melted clown’s face The whole room flinches

ARTHUR

Arthur looks smugly at Thom who breathes a sigh of relief
Arthur grabs his hand again

ARTHUR

AUCTIONEER
I have three thousands pounds
from the gentleman at the back

Horrified and enraged Thom glares at Arthur who grins
He’s getting into this From a corner Emma looks over at
Thom surprised but impressed

AUCTIONEER (CONTD)

Three thousand

Thom’s eyes widen as the panic grows

AUCTIONEER (CONTD)

Arthur winces and slides off

INT SOTHEBY’S - LATER

As the event winds up Thom stands in the lobby with Emma
holding his nightmarish buy The departing guests eye him
with a mixture of sympathy and disgust

EMMA
Listen thank you so much It’s
amazingly generous of you

THOM
No Not at all I’m just thrilled
with my purchase

She glances at the doll - ‘okaay’ Olly sweeps past with
his wife SVETLANA a six-foot pneumatic Barbie She spots
the doll

SVETLANA
Ah It is you who buy against me
I was try for two thousand five
hundred My husband he dont let

Olly visibly embarrassed to see Thom again mutters

OLLY

Thom tries to save face

THOM
Well Ive had my eye on the
artist for some time now
(barbed)
And when I see something I want
I go for it I get it
Interesting investment I think

The sound of familiar laughter swoops in

SIMON (VO)
Ha ha ha Excellent Excellent

As Simon sidles in he looks down at the horrific art work
He stifles a retch A long awkward silence He thrusts out
a hand to Thom

SIMON (CONTD)

lady a fiver then spots the girl behind him Has an idea

ARTHUR (CONTD)

He winks at the girl Who rolls her eyes at him and looks
down at her solitary mini-trifle

ARTHUR (CONTD)

He swans off She stares after him with contempt Thom
looks at her apologetically hands her some coins and
follows Arthur over to the condiments bench

I now find out I’ve got a part in
the school play as the deaf
younger brother

ARTHUR
What Oh my God that’s

He doubles up creased with laughter as they dump their
trays but keep their plates and walk through the canteen

ARTHUR (CONTD)

wants to get off with you You’ve
got to make clear your intentions
whilst masking your emotions
Ambiguity is armour on the
battlefield of romance

He produces a tatty paperback from his blazer ‘Holding
Love’s Hand A Guide to Getting Your Guy’ Defensively off
Thom’s look

ARTHUR (CONTD)
I’ve been doing some research

Thom screws up his face

THOM
I don’t know What happens if she
expects me to order wine or
something

ARTHUR

tentatively steps away from the car crosses the street
and rounds the corner

The alley is aglow with neon Seedy strip joints line the
kerbs Arthur walks on like a moth to a flame agog

resolve glancing back toward the car

ARTHUR

Thom grandly holds the door for Emma as they exit She

chuckles and curtsies
THOM

Across the road Thom spies an ice cream kiosk

THOM

He really wants an ice cream She laughs unused to such

exuberance

At the front of the queue Thom speaks to the server

THOM

She cogitates then nods enthusiastically

EMMA
Uhh Oh my God we’re swapping

She forcibly wrestles his cup off him chuckling away A
group of teenagers bustle past them horsing around giving
each other piggy backs Thom instinctively backs away

EMMA (CONTD)
God don’t you miss being a
teenager

THOM
Not really
(off her look)
I think people who say they’re
the best years of your life must
have really short memories

EMMA
And what’s so great about
adulthood

THOM
Well you’ve gotfreedom No one

Bank holidays and feast days if
I’m lucky

Thom squirms wishing he hadn’t brought it up

Thom almost retches

EXT RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Thom glances at the car parked serenely exactly as he left
it He and Emma face each other Their eyes meet and hold
for a moment Thom nervously tentatively leans in She
lingers for an instant then comes to stepping back
sharply

EMMA

husband will be waiting

THOM
(blushing)

She looks at him then puts out a hand

EMMA

He hesitates then shakes it taking the hint She smiles
stiffly and leaves

Arthur sits up in the back seat still holding his eye
stammering guiltily

ARTHUR

ARTHUR

THOM
What He can’t find out

ARTHUR
What do you mean he can’t find

THOM

Have you any idea what would
happen to me if this got out

ARTHUR
(mounting anger)
So what are we doing Why are we
here What happened to revenge

THOM
This is revenge We’re dating his
wife

ARTHUR

How is it revenge if he doesn’t
find out about it

Arthur stares at him incredulous Then his eyes widen in
terror Over Thom’s shoulder in a car beside them are the
heavies from the club

THOM
Look I’m sorry But

ARTHUR
(quiet panic)
Never mind don’t worry Just go
Go

Thom looks quizzically at him

THOM
Might just wait until I sober up
a bit before

ARTHUR
Don’t worry about that Sure

Over his shoulder the nearest heavy turns catches
Arthur’s eye and double-takes eyes aflame with rage

ARTHUR (CONTD)
GOGO Go

Thom hesitates confused and alarmed WHAM The heavies’
car slams into their side Thom sees his attackers gets
the message and floors it tearing through a red light
Cars skid and swerve to avoid them honking furiously The

shoulder as

the road into a square filled with pub tables and drinkers

ARTHUR

People scatter screaming as Thom wrestles the car out the
other side back onto the street racing into oncoming
traffic The heavies skid into view behind them

A pair of rickshaws head for them side by side The guys
howlthey part just in time and the Aston scrapes between
them close enough to catch some ornamental tinsel on the
wing mirror One lane becomes two and the heavies race up
along side them The two cars tear down a packed street
Traffic lights ahead glow red as the cars bear down

ARTHUR
POLICE

A police car waits at the lights Thom slams on the brakes
as does the other car They draw up at the lights sedately
Thom beside the police And wait

More screaming Arthur panics Thom grabs the phone

THOM

Now listen you will get the car
back but we’re just going to need

back attempting to follow suit but he looks like he’s
caught his nuts in his pants Mr Chandos leaps on stage to
demonstrate

MR CHANDOS
Thom it’s dip then drag dip
then drag Okay from there

As Thom tries again Wesley speaks to Olivia He’s ‘off
book’ and melodramatic while she’s more circumspect and
still refers to her script

WESLEY
I’m saying that he was more than
just my boy He was my brother
This ain’t about revenge it’s
about respect

OLIVIA
There is no respect when you live
by the blade I’m so tired of it
Tired of this madness this
bravado this secretarial
violence

MR CHANDOS
Cut

Olivia blinks down at her furious director

MR CHANDOS (CONTD)
Secretarial violence Really
Olivia It’s sectarian violence
Sectarian

Olivia studies her script

OLIVIA

lot of lines

INT SCHOOL THEATRE - DAY

Students begin to disperse Olivia stands in the wings
anxiously studying her script Thom looks across to her
hesitates and then goes for it

THOM

She looks up confused and annoyed to be interrupted

THOM (CONTD)
(nervous )
So tired of all this secretarial
violence

She looks at him utterly baffled He has to plough on

THOM (CONTD)
We had a drive-by faxing down our
street last week Doris from

paperclips It was brutal

Thom smiles to show that he was joking

OLIVIA
Are you taking the piss
THOM
What No Wellyes obviously
but I don’t know why Sorry
OLIVIA

No carry on It’s really helping
She gestures to her thick script

THOM
Have you got an iPod
She looks up again Where’s he going with this

THOM (CONTD)
Just one thing you could do is
record your lines onto your iPod
then listen to them as you drift
off to sleep That way they sort
of get into your subconscious It
works for me like

He snaps his fingers

OLIVIA
You haven’t got any lines You’re
deaf

Thom reddens slightly

THOM
Well I do it for my chemistry
revision and

He stops realising how geeky that sounds

OLIVIA
Cool

She glides away triumphantly Thom stares after her
astonished to have been outmanoeuvred by her

ARTHUR

I thought she was all ‘Oh Thom

Thom puts an arm around Arthur’s shoulder

THOM
Well the thing about women is
that you’ve got to read between
the lines

Arthur blinks at Thom as if he doesn’t recognise him

THOM (CONTD)
Why would she say something like
that if she only thought of me in
a work sense She must think of
me as more than just a donor You
follow

Arthur bristling at the patronising tone removes his arm

ARTHUR
Just about yeah
(recovers)

lit by candles and full of revellers He marches up the
gangplank and through the throng where he spies a stressed
Emma chatting to guests She notices him and struggles to
mask her shock She awkwardly excuses herself

EMMA

INT SHIP - EVENING

Thom stands at the bar waiting for a barman to appear Sat
at the far end of the room a slightly hangdog guy GERALD
sits alone staring at Thom Thom turns to him and rolls
his eyes at the lack of service Gerald smiles knowingly
then shyly yet suggestively raises an eyebrow and then his
wineglass Thom snaps back to the bar unsure of what that
may have meant Finally the barman arrives

BARMAN
Sorry mate Yes

THOM
Err yes Could I have one white
wine spritzer and one

BARMAN

staring at him He turns back to the barman

THOM

Thom leaves the bar and walks as casually as he can over to
the guy at the far end of the room

THOM (CONTD)
Hi

GERALD

Gerald beams touched Thom has clearly made his day
GERALD

to his ‘phone call’
INT BOAT - NIGHT

Thom holding two drinks approaches Emma hidden by a
group of revellers

but smile as she accepts

THOM (CONTD)
So how’s the canapé situation

EMMA
Canapé situation’s under control

THOM

God that’s a relief I heard
there were fights breaking out
over the smoked salmon blinis

Thom’s clearly proud of his food reference Emma smiles
But not for long

SIMON
Hi there All well OK Emma the
music is fu

Emma pre-emptively steers Simon to one side Thom watches
as he berates her He tries to hear whats being said

SIMON (CONTD)
to liven the thing up It’s
like Diana’s fucking funeral out
here

Thom watches as Emma tries to hold it together He sips
from his drink and slopes away

SIMON (CONT’D)
People’re leaving It’s a
fundraiser Where’s the fun

As Simon speaks we hear the faint sound of jazz piano A
couple of revellers turn There noodling away at the baby
grand in the corner is Thom They pause briefly then
return to their conversations Thom looks around His
efforts are having very little effect He clears his
throat plays a bit louder but nothing He plays a few
more bars and then gives up

He goes to close the piano then rethinks He swallows hard
and gently knocks out a lounge style jazz introduction but
this time the tune feels oddly familiar Gently nervously
he attempts to sing along in a jazz standard style

THOM
My baby doesnt mess around
because she loves me so and this
I know for sure

Though his voice is so weak that it barely registers Simon
and Emma turn to see what’s going on

THOM (CONTD)
But does she really want to but
cant stand to see me walk out
the door

It’s no good People just look confused He’s losing them
and he knows it From the back of the room a solitary voice
pipes up this time strong and clear

GERALD (0S)
Dont try to fight the feeling
cos the thought alone is killing
me right now

Gerald steps forward and joins a grateful Thom next to the
piano as everyone stops to listen

GERALD THOM
Thank God to Mum and Dad for
sticking two together cause we
dont know how

Gerald gestures to him to up the beat

GERALD
Six seven eight You think
youve got it Ohh you think
youve got it But got it just
dont get it Till theres
nothing at aaaaaaaaaaaaallllll

The revellers begin laughing and tapping their feet

THOM
(gaining confidence)
We get together Ohh we get
together But separates always
better when theres feelings
invooooolved

Simon and Emma look around as the room bursts into life
People sing and dance along Emma grins at Simon In the
background fifty people shake it like a polaroid picture

even mentioned it

THOM
Why would I mention that

EMMA
Ermto impress me

THOM
What makes you think I want to
impress you

They share a combative playful smile Thom looks away
first down at his feet

THOM (CONT’D)
I suppose people I know
don’tappreciate stuff like
that I’d rather people didn’t
know

EMMA
You’re so bizarre

THOM
No I just It’s probably my
mum’s fault

(off her look)

When I was growing up she kind of
expected a lot of me And every
time I got like a commendation or
an A grade or whatever it would
just raise her expectations So
the bar gets higher and higher
and one day you know you’re not
gonna reach it

EMMA
So what you wouldn’t tell her

Thom just shrugs

EMMA (CONT’D)
What about your dad

THOM
Oh he died when I was fifteen

EMMA
God sorry That must have been
so difficult

Thom considers this and nods clearly a bit emotional Emma
just stares into his eyes completely taken He smiles
awkwardly as she gently touches his side She leans in
towards him and

BONG Over Thom’s head Big Ben strikes midnight

THOM
Oh shit I really need to go

He backs away and down the gang plank

away into the night

Arthur reluctantly gets to his feet

MR SCHRICTER
‘Me What’ Why don’t you tell us

Arthur considers this for just a moment

ARTHUR

A hush descends This is big Arthur blinks up at him

MR SCHRICTER (CONTD)
Padding around after your little
boyfriend laughing at his jokes
What are you gonna do when he’s
not there for you anymore When
he realises he can do better and
he’s off to medical school and

Arthur looks about to burst

MR SCHRICTER (CONTD)
Oh they’re very good by the way

ARTHUR

A smile slowly spreads on Schricter’s face He’s got him

MR SCHRICTER
Ahh very eloquent Mr Potts Got
any other gems for us

Arthur fights back angry tears

MR SCHRICTER (CONTD)
Nothing else to share

Arthur fixes Schricter with a determined look He goes to
speak but glances across to Thom Thom pleadingly shakes
his head Arthur looks utterly betrayed

MR SCHRICTER (CONTD)
Didn’t think so I suggest you
head straight for Miss Daniels’
office

Arthur reluctantly heads for the door the eyes of the
class on his back

MR SCHRICTER (CONTD)

The bell rings Over the bustle of squeaking chairs

MR SCHRICTER (CONTD)
Alright More on this tomorrow

Arthur sits outside the headmistress’s office glaring
ahead Thom strides down the corridor towards him

ARTHUR

something

ARTHUR
(unconvincingly)
Sorry I didn’t think of it

THOM
Great well now I’ve got
Schricter which would be bad
enough even if I wasn’t trying to
stick it up his wife

Thom reigns himself in as he sees Wesley and some of the
theatre kids walk past Wesley spots him

WESLEY
Hey Thom Olivia just told us

Thom blushes despite himself At the back of the group
Olivia coolly nods a hello

WESLEY (CONT’D)

Thom can hardly believe it

THOM
Oh yeah sure that’d be great

Arthur glances at him wounded scared Thom hesitates
reluctantthen does the right thing

THOM (CONTD)
(breezily’)
Oh hey would it be okay if
Arthur came too

Wesley looks down at Arthur clearly unconvinced Arthur
reddens under his scrutiny

ARTHUR
(aggressively)
It’s fine Forget it I’m busy

Thom turns to Arthur and speaks in hushed tones

THOM
What’s the problem

ARTHUR
Why are you being such a dick

THOM
What

ARTHUR
I’m not a fucking charity case

THOM

Thom masks his anger as he goes to join Wesley and the gang

and line the stair and bannisters craning for a view

ANGLE ON Thom and Schricter At the top of the stairs
peering over the bannister directly above the circle
Thom’s face white as ash

THOM’S POV In the circle on the stone floor lies a
message daubed in paint ‘It’s a little secret just the
Robinsons affair’

Thom backs away from Schricter and the bannister then
bolts shoving students aside In a classroom doorway
watching him go stands Enoch

EXT SCHOOL PLAYING FIELD - DAY

Arthur sits on a bench idly scratching a werewolf into the
wood with a compass He looks up to see Thom charging
towards him He sighs

ARTHUR
Wasn’t me

THOM
You couldn’t resist could you

ARTHUR
It wasn’t me

THOM
Who was it then

ARTHUR
I hate to break it to you but it
might not be about you

THOM
‘It’s a little secret just a
Robinsons’ affair Most of all
youve got to hide it from the
kids’ Mrs Robinson The
Graduate We saw it last year
But you’re right it’s probably
just a coincidence

ARTHUR
Or maybe you told someone else

THOM
(laughs incredulously)
Who Who else would I tell

Arthur shrugs sulkily

THOM (CONTD)
Oh grow up
(a beat)
Did you tell anyone else

Arthur rounds on him tears in his eyes furious

ARTHUR
Who Who am I going to tell
Chazz
(off Thom’s look)
No I didn’t fucking tell Chazz
And that’s sort of where the list
ends isn’t it

He fights back hot tears

THOM

Thom flaps into action as he realises it’s him Schricter
approaches as he scrabbles it out of his jacket He just
has time to see the caller ‘EMMA’ before Schricter
snatches it from him Thom is rigid with terror

Schricter raises the phone to his ear and clears his throat
theatrically playing to the crowd

his form from his record bag

glare as she goes

at his stomach

As she jabbers on Thom stares out the window The car
glides past a small common filled with groups of teens
Smoking scrapping laughing playing games Two boys with
water guns creep up behind a bench of girls and ambush
soaking them The girls pretend to be angry and give chase

anxiously Emma calls out from the en suite bathroom

Thom scans the room for a drinks cabinet He opens the
wardrobe Inside is a smaller cupboard He opens that to
reveal a minibar He reaches in and pulls out a lilliputian
Grand Marnier bottle He frowns at it for a second then
catches sight of himself in the mirror in the wardrobe
door He stares at himself sighs and turns decided

THOM
Emma I think maybe

He turns Emma stands in the en-suite doorway wearing
nothing but a revealing negligee hair cascading over bare
shoulders Thom gasps

THOM (CONTD)

fits and starts She stops just before their chests touch
Her lips millimetres from his

EMMA (CONT’D)
What were you saying

Ummmmmm

She kisses him His eyes virtually roll back in his head
He surrenders for a moment then comes to breaking away

his breath They both glance down at his crotch

THOM (CONTD)

She laughs then eyes him lustily and starts slowly sliding
down his body He watches her descend dumbstruck then
jumps away as she reaches his crotch

THOM (CONTD)
Woah hey I can’t I can’t do
this I’m sorry

He backs away clattering into a trouser press

EMMA
What

THOM
I shouldn’t be here

He catches the trouser press and in doing so nearly topples
into the open wardrobe

EMMA
Oh my God It’s me isn’t it

humiliated naked

Schricter indicates and drives into the school car park

INT AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

Mr and Mrs Schricter shuffle into their seats all fake
smiles and handshakes as the lights dim On stage a lone
‘street kid’ comes out under the spotlight

with his mates The kid you hope

down at the audience Annoyed dads proud mums bored kids

the sides of his head in a panic then runs from the wings
out into the corridor

THOM
Shit Shit shit shit shit

He looks either way for inspiration for help but there’s
nobody there He turns back the way he came and heads for
the backstage area behind the huge scenery flats There he
spots Arthur adjusting the set Thank God

Arthur turns guiltily to face him

THOM (CONTD)
She’s there In the audience
Emma’s here with Mr Schricter
And I’ve got to go on in five
minutes You’ve got to go on for
me
Only as Thom starts removing his costume does he see the
fear in Arthur’s face

THOM (CONT’D)
What’s going on

Thom looks at the flat behind his back but Arthur steps to
the side to cover it up Thom pushes Arthur out the way
It’s the backdrop of an urban wall And on it Arthur has
painted some graffiti A woman in fishnets lying on a bed
and the legend ‘Here lies the wife of Mr Schricter but
which of his little students dicked her’

Thom stares at Arthur in disbelief

KID ACTOR ONE(OS)

and ragging who stood by you

WHAM Thom throws a punch Arthur feels his face for blood
then returns the favour clodding Thom on the back of the
head

direction of the stage set

A huge commotion as Thom and Arthur come CRASHING through
the set They land on the stage and look up to see the
entire audience staring up at them As the main backdrop
collapses the others follow suit like a house of cards and
the entire set falls to the floor The only one to survive
is Arthur’s bit of handiwork

The crowd gasps A few giggles break out At the front of
the stage the actors show resolute professionalism

Thom sit opposite heads bowed Miss Daniels waddles in
front of the boys fuming

MISS DANIELS
NEVER in my years as headmistress
have I witnessed such a vile
piece of childishness Such
vicious lies

Arthur clenches Thom shoots him a warning look - don’t

MISS DANIELS (CONT’D)
Mr Potts I confess I’m less
surprised to find your grubby
hand in all this Mr Barton
however I thought you had more
sense and I’m all the more
shocked and disappointed
considering your application to
medical school

Schricter unfolds the green form on his lap menacingly

MISS DANIELS (CONTD)
Which now

She throws up her hands in disappointed resignation Thom
blinks in terror face drained of all colour as his entire
future evaporates before his eyes

MIS DANIELS
I’m only sad you were weak enough
to let yourself be influenced by
someone who clearly does not have
your best interests at heart Let
me be very clear This appalling
campaign these horrendous
lies

ARTHUR
They’re not lies

Thom looks up from his hands terrified - please no

ARTHUR (CONTD)
They’re true
Thom shakes his head at Arthur silently imploring him

MR SCHRICTER
What are you talking about

Thom Emma and Mr Schricter lean in breath baited A long
pause Arthur glances at Thom like a suicide about to jump

ARTHUR
The rumours are about me

A beat The others gape

ARTHUR (CONTD)

It’s nothing to do with Thom He
was just trying to stop me
putting the banner up

Mr Schricter scoffs Thom is overwhelmed speechless

having an affair with my wife

Arthur nods unconvincingly

MR SCHRICTER (CONTD)

You Arthur Potts
(laughs)

You don’t even have any friends
let alone a girlfriend What
Thethe runt of the litter the
class retard has been seeing my
wife You’re nothing You are a
nobody

Emma stares at her husband shocked at his vicious attack
Arthur reddens This clearly isn’t working Emma looks at
him then looks at Thom’s terrified face

MISS DANIELS
Mr Schricter I know you’re
upset

MR SCHRICTER
Yeah I’m upset I’m upset that
this little piece of shit on my
shoe is trying to tell me he
FUCKED MY WIFE

The boys and Miss Daniels look at Mr Schricter in horror
Emma stares at her seething husband She’s heard enough

EMMA
Actually it’s true
Arthur and Thom look up in disbelief

MR SCHRICTER
I’m sorry what

EMMA
It’s true We met at the garden
party where he was volunteering
And yes we went out a couple of
times I didn’t know he was a
schoolboy obviously but he

MR SCHRICTER
Why would you do that

EMMA
Because I liked him Because he
listened to me He gave a shit

As she speaks it’s clear that she’s realising these things
for the first time

EMMA (CONTD)
He made me feel young and smart
and he was excited to be around
me and itfelt great And he
wanted me to make something of
myself

Schricter’s silenced He knows where this is going

EMMA (CONT’D)
He told me I should apply for law
school

SCHRICTER
And why did he do that I wonder

EMMA
(exploding)
Because he’s not threatened by
the idea of me having a better
career than him

Arthur nods along starting to believe it himself
ARTHUR
Yeah that is true I am well
skill
Mr Schricter scowls at Arthur
EMMA
Oh I got in by the way thanks
for asking I start in September

A flicker of a glance at Thom
EMMA (CONT’D)
I wanted to tell you

MR SCHRICTER
(spits)
So what You slept with him

ARTHUR
(with relish)
Yep we totally boned All sorts
ofnasty shit

EMMA
No we didn’t sleep together

ARTHUR
No we didn’t sleep together

As Arthur talks Thom catches Emma’s eye He gives her a
look of apology and bottomless gratitude

ARTHUR (CONTD)

line isn’t it

MR SCHRICTER

Schricter launches himself at Arthur but Thom’s quicker
stepping between them and grabbing Schricter by the collar

THOM
Youre gonna what Bully him some
more Beat him up this time Big
man

With that Thom shoves him by the collar back onto his
chair Gobsmacked Schricter turns to Miss Daniels

MR SCHRICTER
He assaulted me You saw that

Miss Daniels stares at the two of them A weary beat

MISS DANIELS
No Mr Schricter I didn’t see a
thing I’m not wearing my
glasses

She is wearing her glasses Schricter goes to protest

MISS DANIELS (CONTD)
(granite tough)
Pipe down I think we’ve heard
enough from you And why don’t I
take that

He nods to Thom’s form Schricter reluctantly hands it
over chastened but seething Thom wells up with relief

INT SCHOOL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Thom sits nervously outside the head’s office in the
darkened deserted corridor The muffled sound of angry
exchanges emanates from within Eventually the noises
dissipate The door opens and Emma emerges He looks up at
her sheepishly She shakes her head looks at him gravely

EMMA
Been a long time since I went out
with a schoolboy

He looks to his shoes thoroughly embarrassed She gestures
to the door

EMMA (CONTD)
He seems nice though

Thom smiles

THOM
Yeah He’s alright You’re very
lucky to have him

She smiles back and goes to speak but the door opens again
and she steps away from him as casually as possible Arthur
and Mr Schricter emerge both looking fairly traumatised
Schricter tries to gather his cool

MR SCHRICTER
Right come on Let’s go Home

She just stands there looking at him

MR SCHRICTER (CONTD)
Come on Get in the car

EMMA
I’m sorry No

Arthur and Thom look at each other shocked

MR SCHRICTER
I said Get In The car

EMMA
David I am tired of being spoken
to like a child I’m not coming
home

A stand off Arthur and Thom smirk slightly at Schricter
MR SCHRICTER
(mutters )
Well Maybe if you didn’t behave
like a fucking child

EMMA
Oh seriously Would you
justFuck Off

He fumbles for his keys humiliated Lost for words

MR SCHRICTER
Right Fine

He shuffles off down the corridor clearly shaken Thom and
Arthur share a grin

ARTHUR
Bye sir Have a great weekend
Take care

Schricter punches a locker as he rounds the corner Emma
grabs her mobile from her bag

EMMA
Right Looks like I’ve got some
arrangements to make

ARTHUR
Well you can always kip round

EMMA
No Thanks Arthur but No

She slings her bag over her shoulder

EMMA (CONTD)
It’s a Friday night Apparently
youre sixteen years old
Shouldn’t you be out binge
drinking and happy slapping

THOM
Actually there is a houseparty
The mash-up of the year
apparently But I’m pretty sure
were not invited

EMMA
So what It’s a houseparty God
you two need to grow some balls
These are supposed to be the best
years of your life

She grins sassily at Thom then leans in and kisses him
gently on the cheek She turns and swans off down the
corridor alone Thom and Arthur look at each other
EXT SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT

Thom and Arthur walk along apprehensively dressed up at
least by their standards in teenage garb

THOM
I can’t believe you got
suspended

ARTHUR

What It’s two weeks Of not
having to go to school

(‘gravely’)
It may of course jeopardise my
application to Cambridge Oh no
wait hang on University’s for
bell ends

THOM
(amused sarcastic)
Thanks

He looks at Arthur again - thanks

ARTHUR
So I think Schricter actually
shit his slacks

THOM
Amazing I’m guessing you’re not
getting your art book back any
time soon

Arthur sighs ruefully - he hadnt thought of that Thom
reaches into his bag and takes out the book Arthur gawps
at it in shock then takes it

ARTHUR
How did you

THOM
I’1l £111 you in later

ARTHUR
Youd like to

Their laughter stops as they reach a house festooned with
party paraphernalia Music and the sound of teenage abandon
pumps out into the street

The boys anxiously look up at the house and then at each
other Decision time They wordlessly come to an agreement
As one they march up to the front door Thom goes to knock
but the door’s already open

INT WESLEY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

A packed hallway spilling revelling teenagers into
adjoining rooms and up the stairs The boys move into a
living room strobed by disco lights and pocked with
balloons In the corner a bin full of ice and assorted
booze A crowd mingle and dance self-consciously Thom and
Arthur enter All heads turn their way Groups of kids
whisper and point in awed fascination Thom and Arthur make
their way to the drinks table Most of the revellers
resume Thom spots Olivia with her friends He catches her
eye and hastily turns away Arthur witnesses

ARTHUR
You heard what the woman said
Grow some balls

Thom takes a deep breath grabs two bottles from the ice
bin and strides towards her She smiles coyly as he
approaches

OLIVIA
When I said set the building on
fire

THOM

Couldnt find my zippo Thought
smashing up the set was the next
best thing
OLIVIA
You’re a genius How can I ever
repay you
Thom hesitates then

THOM
How about a dance

Olivia smiles incredulously

OLIVIA
You dance

Thom thinks about it

THOM
I honestly don’t know

He takes her hand and leads her into the bobbing throng
From the buffet table Arthur watches proud as punch

vO
Excuse me
Arthur swivels The three sexy frightening girls face him
gum chewing in unison Arthur sighs

ARTHUR
Look I’m allowed to be here I’m
crew

CUTE GIRL

Are you Arthur Potts

ARTHUR
(warily)
Yeah

Another of the girls leans in excitedly

CUTE GIRL 2
Is it true you like slept with Mr
Schricter’s wife

Arthur just smiles The girls turn to each other thrilled

CUTE GIRL 3
I told you It’s him

They turn as one Eyes on fire Arthur grins sheepishly He
looks over to Thom dancing ludicrously with Olivia Thom
turns and raises his plastic cup with a smile Arthur
responds in kind as Wesley steps forward and pats his
shoulder admiringly drawing him into his group

FADE OUT

EXT CAR PARK SUBURBAN GOLF CLUB - DAY

Paislied middle managers tee-off in the distance Thom in
a suit leans on the back of the Aston Martin talking to
Olly the investment banker Thom holds out a hand

THOM
Six thousand Deal You drive a
hard bargain I’1l tell you that

He pops the boot lifts out the foetal clown doll and hands
it to Olly who smirks as he scribbles a cheque

OLLY
That’s why I’m ahead of the herd
Thom Plus you should see the
wife when she’s grateful

He winks revoltingly Thom moves aside revealing the
dented boot Olly winces

OLLY (CONTD)
Ouch That’s not gonna be cheap

Thom smiles as he takes the cheque

THOM
I’ve got it covered

He climbs in and fires her up casting a grin across to the
passenger seat where Arthur sits waiting

They draw up at a set of traffic lights Arthur leans
forward and switches on the radio A ridiculous fun young
pop tune bursts out A wide-boy revs his engine beside
them Thom revs his engine back

The lights go green The music kicks in
And they roar off into the sunset over the crest of a

hill whooping like jackals as the wide-boy’s left eating
their dust

FADE TO BLACK
