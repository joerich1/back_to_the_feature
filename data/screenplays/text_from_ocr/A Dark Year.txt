EXT CAFE NIGHTFALL 2

The village café with three tables on the outside Only men
dressed up in traditional costume and carrying guns can be
seen These are Shestan Verdha Cute Benja Tod Allamani and
Alush Gjati The other men who aren’t as well dressed as the
first are following the conversation The four friends drink
raki and smoke their tobacco Everyone is looking up at the
comet in the sky

ALUSH
Where you think it’s going to fall

CUTE
What

ALUSH
The comet

Nobody answers

CUTE
I wish it could fall on England on
London I wish it could fall So
that those border maps of the
Balkans could burn down to ashes

SHESTAN
Stop talking nonsense Cute it’s
not going to fall anywhere

CUTE
Then what is it doing up there

s2 p2

SHESTAN
Just coming round and round

CUTE
Round and round just like us here
leave home to come to the café and
then leave the café to go back
home

SHESTAN
Don’t you ever stop

Doské Mokrari enters the café with an elongated pumpkin in
hand

DOSKE
This is how the comet looks like a
pumpkin

He pulls out a knife cuts the pumpkin in half and throws the
seeds on the table He shouts

DOSKE (cont’d)
Get up you morons let’s go and
save Albania because she is in
such an horrible mess already And
you have time to waste with that
harlot up there in the sky

Cute Benja is the most nervous of them all He hits the
ground with his tufted green-hide shoe The chicken scatter
away Dust is raised With a short stick he draws a line
around his foot something like a map

CUTE
Here you are I draw a line around
my foot and what do I get I get
Albania She’s no bigger than this
tufted shoe of mine

SHESTAN
Listen here even the Queen of
England and the King of France know
that Albania is here They say they
have lost the state seals they
have lost the maps and the borders
are nowhere to be found nobody’s
got a clue how to get them back
And you know why Because the Greek
pulls the rope on his side and the
Albanian pulls the rope on his
side and then here comes somebody
else - say a Serb or a Macedonian -
and does away with the markers at
night Then what’s next is that
everybody going to pull out their
guns and it’s damn over

The men nod

CUTE
Hey hey wait a minute You want
to drive me insane How come this
border issue is so hard to figure
out Wherever you have Albanians
that’s where the borders should be
traced No more Albanians the land
isn’t ours

Everyone nods approvingly

Cute (contd)
Do you really think this land is
starving for a king so much that
they took the trouble to order us
one in Europe What do you make of
it

ALUSH
That this country is starving for a
king dammit

The men laugh Shestan Verdha a handsome man keeps silent
thoughtful He rolls a cigarette and puts it between his

care of the farming Who’s coming

any more time We’ve got guns and
bullets ready Count me in

SHESTAN
Well now it’s too late to do
anything It’s our fault too
because we weren’t able to come up
with a king ourselves

TOD

suit comfortably sitting on his horse and protecting
himself from the rain with a big black umbrella Behind hima
young woman follows on foot dressed in fancy-colored
clothes dripping under the rain She wears a cross around
her neck The men greet each other hands on their hearts

won’t even have to worry about the
dowry and the wedding

SHESTAN
What are you talking about

AGNES FATHER
The Sultan’s armies are coming
Our wives and daughters they’ll
have to cover their faces

The fighters don’t buy what the man says

DOSKE

your moustache

AGNES FATHER
My moustache’s none of your
business sir

DOSKE
Yes it is And Albania has no
business with Turkey whatsoever
The empire’s dead it’s history

AGNES FATHER
Don’t you understand you fool The
Turkish Sultan is coming It’s in
the papers It’s over go home

Shestan comes nearer to Agnes’ father and talks coldly
pointing at the exhausted girl

SHESTAN
Get down Let her ride the horse

The man looks scared but he doesn’t budge Shestan cocks his
rifle Cute Doské Tod and Alush try to stop him

DOSKE
Stop it captain Don’t get into a
blood feud These people are
Catholic Their customs are harsh

Quarreling over trifles methinks

Shestan is unconvinced The others try to stop him

SHESTAN
I don’t care what he is I know

way

He approaches Agnes’ father and waits for him to dismount

SHESTAN (contd)
Get off and let the girl mount
She’s your daughter

The man falters then gets off the horse with a frown

Shestan grabs the girl by her arm Agnes tries to resist him
by evading his grip but Shestan grasps her foot and tries
to place it on the stirrup Motions her to get on the horse
She doesn’t move

CUTE
Get on the horse kid It’s for
your own good Your daddy won’t say
anything

Shestan looks at the girl then at her father frozen in
anger and finally greets him placing the palm of his right
hand over his heart Agnes’ father coldly returns the
greeting then hits the horse with his stick The horse jerks
forward Shestan can’t take his eyes off Agnes Agnes stares
back at Shestan They are in love Everyone has noticed how
dazzled Shestan is

stays put with her head down He slaps her hard Agnes hits
the ground He yells at her

little aside to scare the father The horse is startled
instead The man on the horse hits the animal with his stick

him

His words are translated into French

The French commander clears his voice to make the whole
thing appear very formal and serious

CUTE
He seems such an asshole to me

The French commander turns to his interpreter but the
interpreter seems to have trouble making out Cute’s words He
just shakes his head reproachfully

FRENCH COMMANDER
Let’s be frank to each other
France’s wish is that the
situation in the Balkans be
stabilized that’s why we are
here Do you really believe that
the Austrian-Hungarian Empire is
a friend and protector of your
country’s interests I know you
cannot believe such a thing The
truth is that they have their own
interests to pursue and you
legendary commander should avoid
falling into this trap You must
also rest assured that France’s
policy with regards to

Shestan and Cute Benja bend over to the tiny spot on the map
They are incredulous

shoe

shoe Fuck you

He marks his shoe around as to make a map of Albania

FRENCH COMMANDER

one

The interpreter translates with a silly grin The French
commander hands Shestan the map Shestan stares at him

CUTE

Let him keep that piece of trash to
himself

inside screams again with a horrible voice

REBEL

Stunned and smeared with blood one of Shestan’s warriors
comes running out of the smoke Two bullets hit him in the
legs bringing him down He cries out tears running down his
cheeks

to aim at There is an explosion behind his back He opens
his eyes scared to death

torch as the second shot hits closer He closes his ear with
the palm of his hand He waves the torch again

SEFER
Why delay the third shot Is there
anything wrong with the canon

trees One of the fighters produces a clarinet and starts
playing a famous tune Cute Benja and Shestan are dancing
Other fighters join in until the dance becomes really huge
with about thirty people in quilts hanging on from each
other’s shoulders jumping up and down and screaming like
wild beasts out of pleasure Agnes wakes up startled She
sees the men dancing She keeps her eyes trained on Shestan’s
handsome face

While everyone is dancing a group of people wearing
different clothes sneaks in the back These are Macedonian
peasants armed with rifles and hay forks Nobody notices
them They stop at a short distance from Shestan’s fighters
They wave their hands in order to attract the dancers’
attention but in vain Finally the Macedonians shoot their
weapons in the air The Albanian fighters freeze and look
around Nobody has been hit The two sides stare at each
other challengingly

MACEDONIAN PEASANT
(in Macedonian)
Who are you

SHESTAN
Who are you

None of the Macedonians replies

CUTE (contd)

It looks like we have trespassed
on the goddamned Macedonian
territory

in order to stop him

inching closer on their guard The Macedonian peasants listen
to him in silence still unconvinced

MACEDONIAN PEASANT

wedding

MACEDONIAN PEASANT
‘Cause we know these tunes too
But we play them properly much
better than you do

SHESTAN

Divided by a river

He offers the Macedonian his tobacco pouch

SHESTAN (contd)
Here roll a cigarette

The Macedonian hesitates looks around Doské and Cute have
taken out their own tobacco pouches One of the Macedonians
accepts the offer with words of gratitude Everyone else
follows The sight of these scores of men smoking evokes a
feeling of peace The Macedonian is now staring at Agnes He
turns to Shestan

MACEDONIAN PEASANT
That girl over there do you use
her for fun

s46 p53

The Macedonian peasants laugh and stare at Agnes She gets
scared Shestan looks at them with a frown

SHESTAN
No We aren’t here to have that
kind of fun

MACEDONIAN PEASANT
Why don’t you give us the girl
Well pay you handsomely

Shestan tries to control himself Some Macedonian peasants
giggle Shestan starts talking his voice not disguising the
hidden threat

tambourine The music starts Shestan’s men get up and start

dancing by the fire On the other bank the Macedonians look

surprised Shestan’s men jump up in the air graciously their
kilts fluttering like wings

The Macedonians watch while one of them leaves for the
village The dance goes on and on

an

Now it’s the Macedonians’ turn to start dancing on the
opposite bank of the river Their dance is similar to the
Albanians’ They are gradually racing each other The
Macedonian orchestra consists of a clarinet a violin anda
drum Shestan and his fighters watch on Now they have to
wait for the Macedonians to finish dancing They wait
covered with sweat The Macedonian dance seems to go on and
on forever

be patient

But the Macedonians keep dancing on and on jumping around
screaming out of pleasure

They look tired now and some of them give up and fall to the
ground But new ones join the dance and it seems it will
never end

Now the Albanians resume dancing without waiting for the
Macedonians to stop The race becomes real which group will
outperform the other The excitement gets out of control
Agnes stays crouched scared by the men’s fury

The dancers’ crowd is getting thinner on both sides
because some of those dancing are now down on the ground
Still a couple of men hold on Angry at their opponents’
perseverance they keep moving and shouting in Macedonian and
Albanian

As the dervish goes on with his speech Shestan and his
companions look at the faces of those listening Suddenly a
group of religious kids dressed in white robes come out from
the mosque running threateningly and they join the
listeners sitting down cross legged Shestan is getting very
suspicious and feels the situation is turning acid (a2)

Ahmet the dervish refuses to answer climbs down the rock and
heads for the mosque leaning on his walking stick As
Shestan’s fighters leave the small square kids follow them
and throw stones at them They do not react

SHESTAN (contd)
Let it be they’re just kids They

where people are going up to the Hill of Holy Grave She sees
in the distance the procession of nuns coming towards her
She kneels on the side of the road and waits for them

(a6) The procession of nuns is about to pass Agnes still
kneeling on the side of the road when Mother Superior
suddenly notices her and tells the nuns to halt Agnes throws
herself flat on the ground asking for forgiveness Mother
Superior looks at her then makes sure the other nuns are
listening Then she speaks

MOTHER SUPERIOR
Now now my child come Rise
up

Agnes gets on her knees head bowed

MOTHER SUPERIOR (cont’d)
Why don’t you go back home

AGNES
I can’t Mother I have sinned

MOTHER SUPERIOR
Do you remember what I told you
once

Silence

MOTHER SUPERIOR (cont’d)
I told you you had to choose
between the love of God and that of
a man

MOTHER SUPERIOR (contd)

That if you wait for God he will
certainly come to you but if you
wait for a man it isn’t going to
happen even if he isn’t killed in
the war Do you remember

AGNES
Yes mother

s78 p77

Mother Superior speaks with a soothing humbleness

MOTHER SUPERIOR
Poor Agnes you see I - myself -
isnt much in the eyes of the
Almighty and I didnt want to make
a prediction I am not a
soothsayer I am too small a being
on this earth to have the power to
know what will happen in the
future Only God knows what will
happen and He shall prevail We
all put our faith in Him
Maybe God spoke through my words
when He tried to warn you and
this is why what I told you
cannot be a prediction

Agnes looks defeated but doesn’t move She didn’t quite catch
what Mother Superior is getting at

MOTHER SUPERIOR (cont’d)
Of course I know my poor child
you didn’t want this to happen but
it has happened That’s the way it
goes in life I have heard that a
party of Albanian Muslims from the
village of Mokér has been
slaughtered about twenty kilometers
from here in an ambush inside some
inn It was a massacre I was told
none of them survived I believe we
are talking about the same people
I am really sorry

Then Mother Superior just walks away towards the Sacred hill
followed by her nuns and some people Agnes is completely

destroyed A crowd passes by

she doesnt move for a while

Some wind blows Time passes while she stays curled up in the

dust

Finally she rises She seems elsewhere She follows the crowd
like a ghost Her robe is gray with dust

EXT HILL OF THE HOLY GRAVE SUNNY DAY

The hill shimmers under the sun Two different processions
join each other on the top of the hill

The first is composed of Catholic peasants from St Mary’s
village with a large cross carried by several people The
other procession comes from the neighboring Muslim village of
Zall Her hoisting the green flag with the moon crescent
Agnes gets in the crowd and hides behind the nuns

On top of the hill a Muslim old timer points to a large
rock half buried in the ground There’s an Arabic
inscription on one side of the rock and a Latin inscription
on the other side He points to the sky (a7)

OLD MAN
Listen to me all of you This is
the Holy Grave of Saint
Doruntina a saint for Muslims
and Christians Ahmet the dervish
will be buried alive and will
stay inside his grave until
sunset We shall dig him out only
then and if Allah helped him
stay alive well erect the
mosque right here Nobody will
have to fight about it any more
Now it’s up to you Christians
to select one of your kind to be
sacrificed and see whether he’ll
make it until sunset If nobody
wants to be sacrificed then go
back to your place and ring your
bells and let everyone know that
a mosque is going to be built
right here with Allah’s help

Three men are already digging the grave for Ahmet He sits by
the grave and waits he prays rosary in hand The Catholic
side remains silent The old Muslim yells out loud

OLD MAN (cont’d)
Isn’t there anyone among you
Christians who is ready to give up
his life for his God

Silence (a8) Agnes turns to the assembly and speaks out with
a loud voice

AGNES
Listen to me people Muslims and
Christians Take me to the cross I
want to be crucified Let my father
know that his daughter followed
Gods way let everyone here or
above know this

The nuns can hardly believe their ears Agnes’ decision is
final Everybody else is talking Ahmet the dervish looks
incredulous The Catholic crowd starts praying in chorus
They kneel

s79 p79

Agnes is trembling The nuns kneel in front of the statue of
Jesus and pray Everybody is taken by a frenzy of prayer The
Christian side repeats in chorus “Amen Amen” Agnes takes a
few steps forward and looks at the assembly Mother Superior
shakes her head looking away in apparent disapproval Agnes
crosses herself and covers her face so that nobody can see
her pain The cross is laid down The old man speaks

OLD MAN
When everything is ready well
leave them alone with their God
At sunset it will be over if
the dervish has survived we
shall build the mosque if the
woman has survived you may build
your church If they’re both
dead nothing’s going to be
erected

Murmurs Ahmet the dervish is given some water The Skinny
Nun takes water to Agnes Agnes recognizes her and smiles
Drinks water from her hand

SKINNY NUN
Ill watch you Live on sister
