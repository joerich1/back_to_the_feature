investigative reporter for the New
York Times We are looking into
sexual harassment in the workplace
I believe you were an employee at
Miramax and worked for Harvey
Weinstein in the 90s

FEMALE VOICE (0S)
Are you recording this

JODI
No absolutely not and I won’t quote
from this conversation without your
permission But in your time as an
assistant were you aware of any
instances in which Harvey Weinstein
treated women inappropriately Or
crossed a line

FEMALE VOICE (0S)
Did Harvey cross a line

And the ex-employee hangs up Jodi crosses out a name

calling back

Harvey Who have you talked to

PRODUCTION 2ND PINK - 101621 23

JODI
I can’t tell you names Just as Id
never divulge yours But if you
wanted to share anything that you
know that would really help

MARY (0S)
Yes I don’t think people will
want to talk Sorry

And Mary hangs up

JODI
Okay Thanks for your time

She crosses out a name She dials another number Rebecca
approaches from her office

JODI (CONTD)
Oh hi Rose this is Jodi Kantor
from the New York Times I wrote
you an email Shaunna Thomas
suggested you might be willing to
have a conversation with me about
Hollywood and specifically Harvey
Weinstein

ROSE (0S)
Are you writing about him

JODI
Yes I am

Rebecca hears the name Rose and retreats

JODI (CONTD)
I know this is not necessarily easy
to speak about but I would really
appreciate hearing more about your
experiences

ROSE (0S)
Rightlook I don’t feel that
inclined to talk to you about it
Jodi flinches it’s a blow

JODI
--Could I ask why not

PRODUCTION 2ND PINK - 101621 24

Rose gathers her armor and defends herself

ROSE (0S)
Here’s the thing I’ve been
treated quite shabbily by your
paper numerous times and I
believe the root of it is sexism

Jodi juggles the call She has to have Rose on their side

JODI
I’m sorry that was your
experience But I have worked on
a lot of gender-related issues

ROSE (0S)
And I’ve talked in the past And
nothing happened I spoke at a
political meeting recently and the
NYT put it in the “Style” Section
It does damage To shout and no
one listens

JODI
Rose I’m investigating systemic
sexism in Hollywood

ROSE (0S)
How many pages have you got No I
put myself on the line before and
it made no difference

Jodi feels the urgency to meet Rose and steams forward

JODI
I’ve written about the workplace at
Amazon Starbucks and Harvard
Business School And change did
happen They reformed their
policies as a direct result of the
Times articles

ROSE (0S)
Okay

JODI
--Another story I wrote led to the
introduction of lactation suites
around the country for new mothers
on low incomes But if you don’t
want to talk I understand And
good luck with your book

We’re looking at extreme sexual
harassment in the workplace

technically even a workplace

situations These young women

reason to believe were Business
Meetings with A Producer An
Employer They were hopefulthey
were expecting a serious

say he met them with threats and
sexual demands They claim assault
and rape If that can happen to

happening to

Megan looks at the WOMAN Latina attractive strong but a
trace of damage 40s it’s the Ex-Assistant Herself

MEGAN ( SHOCKED)
Hi

A young GIRL 7 is with the WOMAN and looks at Megan

WOMAN
Hello

Megan takes a moment to recalibrate The excitement of being
face to face with the ex-employee who disappeared

MEGAN

I Was expecting your mother
WOMAN

Ill get her Who shall I say
MEGAN

No No It’s you I wanted to see
WOMAN

Excuse me
MEGAN

I’m Megan Twohey I’m an
investigative reporter for the
New York Times

The Woman takes this in she looks scared she ushers her
daughter back into the house

WOMAN
Go back upstairs to abuelita

The Girl walks back into the house

MEGAN
Can we talk for a minute About
your time with Miramax

The Woman is hit by the word Miramax breathes hesitates

WOMAN
I can’t believe you found me I’ve
been waiting for this for twenty
five years

PRODUCTION 2ND PINK - 101621 49

MEGAN
Can we talk Please It’s
important

The Woman looks upset but tries to hide it

MEGAN (CONTD)

Ill leave as soon as you tell me
to but it would be so useful just
to hear anything about your time
working for Harvey Weinstein

The Woman looks down at the very mention of his name and she
breathes she comes out and closes the door and walks to a
nearby wall Megan follows and stands with her

WOMAN
What do you know

MEGAN
That you were at the beginning of
your career and doing well That
something happened and then you
disappeared

The Woman nods troubled at the amount of detail

MEGAN (CONTD)
-and that your father threatened
legal action

The Woman processes this pulls herself together

WOMAN
So I had a business dispute
with Miramax it was resolved
amicably and we’ve agreed not to
discuss it

MEGAN
Okay

WOMAN
-I’m sorry

MEGAN
It’s good to meet you anyway So
it was “resolved”

exhaustion

WOMAN
Yeah the worry continues

There is a pause

MEGAN
I do appreciate your talking to me
There are women who have had
settlements and they’re bound to
silence but we have written
around them it is possible to
report around that restriction A
source can remain anonymous

The Woman nods but cannot go there

WOMAN
- I should go back in

MEGAN
--A lot of my work has been around
women who have been assaulted And
it’s not just the horrific event
they have had to survive but the
aftermath Where they have to fight
to be believed

The Woman looks directly at Megan and she looks scared and
crushed for some moments fighting to get breath

WOMAN
Yesit must be very hard for them

And the Woman tries not to break down

But if someone could talk freely
about the payouts that would be
hugely helpful

MRS SCHMIDT
What payouts John

Megan loiters a little behind them on the phone

MEGAN
I really appreciate you talking to
me on a Saturday

WOMAN (0S)
I hope the links were useful

MEGAN
They were But I find it very
strange that if I want to access
certain information I can’t

WOMAN (0S)
The EEOC is all about information
What could you not find

MEGAN
For instance which companies have
had the most sexual harassment
complaints But no one was
permitted to tell me that

WOMAN (0S)
Yes that would be confidential
information

MEGAN
Do you think that’s right
Shouldn’t the Equal Employment
Opportunities Commission be a
resource for information From what
I understand the commission has
minimal enforcement authority
and your founding mandate requires
you to Settle whenever possible and
to Disclose as Little as possible

WOMAN (0S)
Youre putting your own emphasis in
there Megan

MEGAN
Those are facts though aren’t they
Correct me if I’m wrong
PRODUCTION 2ND PINK - 101621 58

WOMAN (0S)
They are And it could improve
most large organizations could

MEGAN
You basically have no transparency
at all And there doesn’t seem to
be any fighting on behalf of
the women involved

WOMAN (0S)
Our policies are reviewed annually

MEGAN
Do you know internally which
companies have the most charges

WOMAN (0S)
Yes we do But we’re not allowed to
disclose that information

MEGAN
So any woman applying for a job is
not allowed to check any record
that employer has in terms of
harassment

WOMAN (0OS)
That’s right You should probably
talk to someone higher up

MEGAN
I will but don’t you think that’s
strange that the Commission exists
to protect people but its policy
prohibits sharing the information
needed to protect them

WOMAN (0S)
Megan I’m not the head of the EEOC
I was just trying to help

MEGAN
And you have And it’s the weekend
I really thank you

WOMAN (0OS)
Okay Goodbye

The Woman hangs up Megan joins Vadim and Mira she’s amazed

NYT NEWSROOM - BY MATT’S OFFICE - 3RD FL DAY

NYT - MATT PURDY’S OFFICE - 3RD FL DAY

JODI

The non-disclosure agreements are
never examined or questioned They
rarely come up in open court Law
schools don’t teach them Also the
attorneys who represent the victim
can get up to forty percent of the
settlement

and Megan walk with intent towards a small glass office

and Megan sit with Rebecca and Matt Purdy Rebecca has a
of printed notes in her hand which she looks at now
PRODUCTION 2ND PINK - 101621

MATT PURDY
That’s a big incentive to keep that
system going

MEGAN
Most sexual harassment cases are
settled out of court and most of
them have a confidentiality
clause and the women who sign
these contracts they have to give
over all of their evidence
Diaries Emails phones It’s
like the complainants are the
attackers

JODI
It’s cash for silence And enables
the abusers to continue

MEGAN
And these clauses are standard
practice The women need the
money they want to close the case
and they don’t want to be branded
liars or flirts

JODI
I’m sure it can feel like the only
recourse

MEGAN

I imagine some victims see a
settlement as a confession of
guilt They think they’ve scored a
victory when it’s actually a
gagging order And if you try and
take this kind of case to court the
sexual harassment laws are so weak

JODI
They’re actually non-existent if
youre a freelancer Or if the
company has less than fifteen
employees in the workplace

MEGAN
--Also most lawyers prefer
settlements because it’s less of a
financial risk for them

Rebecca nods
PRODUCTION 2ND PINK - 101621 67

How close are any of the actresses
to going on the record

JODI
We’re introducing the idea

REBECCA
I’m afraid we’ll have various
horrific hotel room accounts and no
corroborating evidence Everything
has got to be done very cleanly
What is your strategy for getting
these women to go on the record

MEGAN
We feel that they’ll speak out if
they’re not the only ones safety
in numbers

MATT PURDY
And settlements

MEGAN
Three so far There’s Rose McGowan
We’re pretty sure about Ambra
Battilana And I’d guess the same
with the ex-assistant in Queens

MATT PURDY

he needs to say it publicly I’ve

There was an incident in
Venice at the film festival It
was 98

JODI
What happened

But the Ex-Miramax Executive cannot go there

EX-MIRAMAX EXECUTIVE
What makes me most angryis the
silence No one spoke out then and
no one’s talking about it nowhe
built the silence And people
complied He produced fear and
intimidation The only
alternative seemingly was to quit
And to throw away everything you
had worked so hard for out of the
door You were terrified youd be
the next target So people looked
the other way

JODI
Within the company

EX-MIRAMAX EXECUTIVE
And outside of it he played the
press He played the agents

JODI
How did he play the press

PRODUCTION 2ND PINK - 101621 72

in exchange for hushing up some
incident

What sort of incident

EX-MIRAMAX EXECUTIVE
Where to start okay Harvey had a
- what did they call it a
physical altercation with a male
employee at a conference And then
they settled with the guy

JODI
And with women

EX-MIRAMAX EXECUTIVE
He pursued them endlessly

attractive 40s in his driveway cleaning his mini-van

JODI
Hi So I’m sorry to bother you I
see you’re busy I’m actually
looking for Rowena Chiu

ANDREW
Hi Rowena’s not here right now
Can I give her a message

JODI
Oh Okay When will Rowena be
home

ANDREW
My wife’s out of the country For a
while

JODI
Oh I see I did try calling
her

ANDREW
Rowena’s in England Is this a work
thing

JODI

No You must be Andrew Andrew
Cheung I’m Jodi Kantor from the
New York Times

Andrew nods intrigued but wary

ANDREW
OkaySo what did you want to talk
to Rowena about

JODI
Were researching a story about
Miramax I flew in from New York

ANDREW
You came all this way

JODI
Yes Could we speak for a minute

ANDREW
Sure
PRODUCTION 2ND PINK - 101621

JODI
I’ve been talking to people who
worked for Harvey Weinstein

ANDREW
Youre going quite far back with
Rowena’s time there

JODI
We’re writing about his treatment
of women

ANDREW
Right And Rowena fits in how

Jodi thinks he is bluffing

JODI
Your wife worked at Miramax for
some years

ANDREW
Yes Mainly in Hong Kong

JODI
Id like to hear about her
experience of working for
Weinstein

ANDREW
I’m confused why you can’t discuss
it on the phone

JODI
I did try But it’s always better
to actually meet

Jodi decides to be absolutely honest and straight

JODI (CONTD)
So and this is off the record My
understanding is that Weinstein
possibly victimized your wife When
Rowena first worked for him

Andrew shakes his head

ANDREW
Rowena’s never mentioned anything
like that to me What do you mean
by “victimized” Can you be more
specific
PRODUCTION 2ND PINK - 101621 76

JODI
I was told that Rowena may have
received a settlement From
Weinstein

Andrew shakes his head He looks at their house
ANDREW
Do I look like a guy whose wife got

a settlement

It is modest Jodi stricken realizes that he knows Nothing

JODI
When does Rowena get back from
England

ANDREW

Could you have confused her with
someone else

Jodi knows he is telling the truth and feels Terrible

JODI
I apologize for taking up your
time But would you please give
this to Rowena

Jodi gives Andrew a sealed envelope

ANDREW
If you’re talking to these other
people why do you need to talk to
Rowena And if you turn up in my
drivewaywhat kind of
victimization

JODI
It’s complex

ANDREW
I’m asking you to expand on it

Jodi looks towards her car troubled
JODI

I think it would be best if you
asked Rowena

it is large and half open with reams of stapled papers that
could be documents or letters they have the Miramax logo

JODI
This is a nice place

ZELDA PERKINS

Zelda is a bit on edge

ZELDA PERKINS (CONTD)

- You know other people have

kills it every time

JODI

We’re aware of that And we’re not
going to let that happen to us

Zelda looks around

JODI (CONTD)

Are you okay Zelda

Yes

ZELDA PERKINS

JODI

So You started working at Miramax
when you were twenty one

ZELDA PERKINS

Yes I was an assistant in the
London office

JODI

How was it

ZELDA PERKINS

It was great But it would shift
when Harvey came to town

JODI

In what way

ZELDA PERKINS

Everyone became on call to

Harvey

JODI

What did that entail

ZELDA PERKINS

Script meetings discussions
And then more personal stuff

Like

Zelda breathes

JODI

she needs to tell the whole story

PRODUCTION 2ND PINK - 101621

ZELDA PERKINS
For instance I would have to go
to the hotel and wake Harvey up
Run his shower for him Get him out
of bed He would usually be
nakedhe might try to pull me
onto him

JODI
What did you do

ZELDA PERKINS
Id fend him off I found humor or
aggression worked best Harvey was
always either excited or
furiousYou never knew which it
would be

JODI
Did anyone on the team give you
advice about him

ZELDA PERKINS
Yes once one girl told me to
always wear my puffer jacket and to
sit in an armchair not the sofa
next to him Which helped That’s
how I knew it wasn’t only happening
to me

JODI
What exactly was happening

ZELDA PERKINS
Bullying emotional abuse I was
too young to understand it

JODI
Right How long would he stay

ZELDA PERKINS
A few days A week And then he’d
go back to America

JODI
How was that

ZELDA PERKINS
There was relief and a sort of
comedown that you’d survived

JODI
And everyone knew how he was

PRODUCTION 2ND PINK - 101621 81

ZELDA PERKINS
People knew he could be
inappropriate that was standard
Harvey He could also be charming
Everyone normalized his behavior
He played people He was a master
manipulator “No” wasn’t an option

JODI
With women

ZELDA PERKINS
Or men Harvey wanted people To
submit to him

JODI
And if they didn’t

ZELDA PERKINS
Then he’d roar and he’d spit He
could destroy someone in seconds

JODI
Were You scared of him

ZELDA PERKINS
We all were

Zelda looks away trying to gather herself it’s harder than
she thought it would be Just talking

JODI
Three years into this you were at
the Venice Film festival

ZELDA PERKINS
I resigned after that

JODI
What happened

ZELDA PERKINS
I can’t tell you all of it

JODI
What can you tell me

Jodi waits Zelda pours herself some more water

ZELDA PERKINS
There was a new assistant my age

-and she was great very smart
(MORE )
PRODUCTION 2ND PINK - 101621

ZELDA PERKINS (CONTD)
And she was doing Harvey’s evening
script meeting alone for the first
time I told her to call me if he
got difficult

JODI
Was he pursuing her

ZELDA PERKINS
No Harvey told me he didn’t like
Jewish or Asian women But that
night

Zelda drinks water

JODI
She called you

ZELDA PERKINS
No But the next morning she came
to me hysterical sobbing I
held her And I was crying too

JODI
Did she tell you what he did

Zelda indicates no

ZELDA PERKINS
Not exactly Only that no one must
know But I knew that Harvey must
have

JODI
What

ZELDA PERKINS
She was so upset I felt it must
have been the worst thing possible
I calmed her down and I went
straight out to confront Harvey He
was in a meeting with
Scorsese who hated him so it
was a big deal for Harvey and I
went up to him and said very
clearly “I need you to come with
me right now”

--Zelda stops
JODI

You went straight up to them and
confronted him

PRODUCTION 2ND PINK - 101621

A pause

ZELDA PERKINS
Yeah I was so angry And in
front of everyone he stood up and
followed me like a lamb And then I
knew I knew he did it

JODI
And then

ZELDA PERKINS ( NODS)
Oh he denied it and he said ” I
swear on my wife and kids’ lives
that I did not assault that young
woman” And then I knew that he was
lying That he’d assaulted her He
always used that line as a get out
of jail free card Always

JODI
Did the assistant report it To the
police

ZELDA PERKINS
No She told no one We went back
to London and we both resigned I
told my direct superior who
suggested we get ourselves a good
lawyer I had no idea where to get
one but I found a company close to
our office

JODI
- And

ZELDA PERKINS

And I thought it would be simple
then criminal proceedings But
our lawyers kept saying we’d have
no chance and the only thing to do
was agree to a settlement I said
categorically no That no money
should change hands And that we
just wanted to stop him They kept
saying we had no choice and that
Miramax wouldn’t come to the table
unless there was a settlement

PRODUCTION 2ND PINK - 101621

JODI
And no UK police were involved

ZELDA PERKINS
We had no case No evidence No
police report from Venice And with
rape it’s impossibly difficult to
get a prosecution The lawyers said
damage limitation was the only way
to go So then I said alright we
have some very real demands
Conditions that Harvey would have
to meet If we were going to sign

JODI
What were the demands

ZELDA PERKINS
I had a list But they battled us
down to the most important ones

JODI
Can you tell me what those
negotiations looked like

ZELDA PERKINS
We were kept in a room One night
we were there till five am we
weren’t allowed pens nothing to
write with We’d be accompanied to
the loo And Harvey’s legal team
demanded the names of the people
wed told anything to and I refused
because I thought they’d go after
them

JODI
You were scared they’d hurt them

ZELDA PERKINS
Yes And we were being treated like
the criminals

JODI
What conditions did they finally
agree to

ZELDA PERKINS
We demanded that if Harvey had
another settlement within two years
it had to be reported to Disney or
he would be fired Another was that
he would have therapy

(MORE )

PRODUCTION 2ND PINK - 101621 84a

ZELDA PERKINS (CONTD)
with me present initially so he

couldn’t lie to the therapist
(MORE )
PRODUCTION 2ND PINK - 101621

ZELDA PERKINS (CONTD)
we demanded that HR would introduce
a system to protect the women and
staff and it felt like if we
could achieve all of those That
was what we were paying for with
our silence We were paying for
him to stop So finally we signed
but they had their own insane
conditions for us

JODI
What were they

Zelda stops Drinks some water Trying to be clear but
obviously affected by the memory

ZELDA PERKINS
I tried to commit them to memory
they wouldn’t give us our own copy

JODI
What

ZELDA PERKINS
I was only given visitation rights
to my own settlement

JODI
That’s incrediblebut you
memorized them

Jodi glances under the table again bundles of papers

ZELDA PERKINS
I asked for letters too which
stated some of the conditions One
said ”“ You will make best endeavors
to not help the police in a
criminal or civil case”

JODI
And what else

ZELDA PERKINS
We weren’t to talk to our family or
a doctor We signed it They paid
us some money And I felt
completely broken

JODI
What did you do
PRODUCTION 2ND PINK - 101621 86

ZELDA PERKINS
I interviewed for jobs afterwards
and everyone said why would you
leave Harvey And they presumed
I’d Been you knowwith him It
was horrible

JODI
You couldn’t tell anyone you’d
stood up to him

ZELDA PERKINS
It was a huge deal If I broke
the terms of the NDA he could come
after me and my family financially
I believed I’d go to jail

JODI
I know What did you do then

ZELDA PERKINS
I went to visit a friend in
Guatemala And I stayed for five
years I’d lost any chance of
working in film I couldn’t speak
freely to anyone I worked with
horses

Zelda breathes

JODI
You lost a lot

Zelda looks at her

wanted to contact a therapist or an

this is bigger than Weinstein This
is the system protecting abusers

working directly for him Doing
errands Answering calls I was
very happy to be asked

So where did you meet him

LAURA
In Dublin At his hotel He was
charming there were sandwiches
And champagne And he was saying
he’d heard how hard I worked and I
was just excited I was twenty
one you know very young and
incredibly keen But I was shy
too so when he said he’d give me
a permanent job in the London
office I felt so happy

JODI
He said that to you in the meeting

LAURA
Yes He was in his bath robe when
he opened the door But I thought
that was maybe very Hollywood
But quite soon into talking he said
would I give him a massage And I
said no He was very matter of fact
he said it’s not a romantic
request everyone does it for
him it’s part of the job So I
suddenly saw myself as the problem
you know that I was the one who
was sexualizing it That I was
just young and uptight So I put
my hands on his shoulders but I
still couldn’t actually move them
at all over his body I just
stood there and froze my hands
wouldn’t move

off And I did I was terrified
but I just thought get through it

marked me and all my decisions And
I felt such shame that I’d let
him do that

Did you think he’d done the same to

Ambra Battilana Gutierrez almost
certainly settled And John Schmidt
confirmed that Miramax settled with

MEGAN
No David Boies and Lanny Davis
want to come and talk to us

What do you think

Don’t we want to hold off and push
for an on the record interview with
Weinstein

DEAN BAQUET ( TO REBECCA)
It’s your call Binky

MEGAN
You know I’d like to talk to
Lanny at least Just to see what he
has to say

Lanny enjoys talking

PRODUCTION 2ND PINK - 101621

LANNY DAVIS
Sure Harvey’s not always that
rational The reason I’m here is
not to try to kill anything I want
to know that if you’re including
something like Rose McGowan’s claim
then we can defend that

REBECCA
Of course

LANNY DAVIS
I know you’ll be investigating with
due diligence

REBECCA
Lanny you’ll have every chance
to respond

LANNY DAVIS
I don’t expect you to name
sources but if it’s possible for
you to let me know overall what
your story is about

MEGAN
Were looking into problematic
behavior towards women by
Weinstein

LANNY DAVIS
Okay Harvey adamantly denies any
allegation of rape or assault
Nothing criminal but he is aware
of complaints about his treatment
of women And he’s working on that
Powerful men of an older generation
are changing their understanding of
the meaning of the word
consensual why women don’t feel
it’s consensual even if a man
convinces himself it is

MEGAN
Do you want to expand on that

LANNY DAVIS
I believe that there is a story to
be told about the evolution of men
and in particular Harvey on this
subject

PRODUCTION 2ND PINK - 101621 100

REBECCA
Would he be willing to talk to us
about it On the record

LANNY DAVIS
He has to deal with his wife and
children before anything else

MEGAN
You’re adamant that Rose McGowan’s
rape accusation is false Why

LANNY DAVIS
Did she tell anybody right away
Did she show signs of distress

MEGAN
She told her manager and a lawyer

LANNY DAVIS
Harvey was aware that there was a
problem with Rose but not that she
was accusing him of rape So Im
making a bright line on the word
rape Anything below that line he
was aware of feeling concerns

JODI
Of what kind

Lanny looks at her Stops

MEGAN
If the concerns were not about
rape then what were they about

Lanny gathers himself

LANNY DAVIS
The only way I can answer is a
sense of being exploited because of
that disparate power relationship
There’s mental coercion that isn’t
physical coercion Lisa Bloom has
been working with Harvey to help
him recognize the difference

Megan and Jodi are astonished and their bodies subtly tell us
that Megan tries to contain her astonishment

MEGAN
Lisa Bloom
PRODUCTION 2ND PINK - 101621 101

Megan glances at Jodi They have a moment of absolute
amazement and connection

LANNY DAVIS
Yes

MEGAN
If Weinstein had been made aware of
McGowan’s concerns at the time how
did he respond

LANNY DAVIS
I believe he had dealings legally
with her about them

MEGAN
How would you characterize those
legal dealings

LANNY DAVIS
I think he became aware that she
did not regard what happened as
okay with her I’m not talking
about rape I’m talking about the
effect that he had on Rose McGowan
And that rather than fighting

MEGAN
Rather than fighting then what

LANNY DAVIS
I think that he has agreed to
settlements rather than litigating
what he might have litigated As
Harvey saw it It was better to
settle even if you haven’t done
anything wrong

The women variously take in the word “settle” A victory

MEGAN
He preferred “to settle”

Lanny nods

MEGAN (CONTD)
Were there other cases of
“questionable intimate relations
with women in which Weinstein
settled”

Lanny Davis hesitates Caught and awkward
PRODUCTION 2ND PINK - 101621 102

LANNY DAVIS
Let’s say for now even on a
background basis that I need to
find out what my limits are
legally even if on background I am
confirming settlements But the
answer is yes there have been

MEGAN
How many

Lanny realizes he has gone into a big hole A pause Lanny

shakes his head He won’t go there

MEGAN (CONTD)
Lanny has Weinstein tried to
interfere with our reporting in any
way

LANNY DAVIS
No Harvey has no intentions of
getting in the way I asked him
that Unequivocally no he said

He stares at the women they stare at him Lanny is backing

into his chair

they should also be entitled to

upset to speak

REBECCA
Lauren I’m sorry that this is
difficult for you We are not going
to publish the whole of the memo
And we will make it absolutely
clear that you were not the source
and that you declined to comment
But we do intend to use your name
for its credibility If you were a
victim of sexual assault we would
absolutely keep your anonymity
But as a Witness to what went on it
would make this story much stronger
to name you Our hope is that
Weinstein’s abusive behavior will
be stopped by this article I hope
you can see that But if you want
to make a stronger case for us not
using your name we do invite you
to do that Lauren
