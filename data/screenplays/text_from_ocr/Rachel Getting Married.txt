1 EXT HALFWAY HOUSE PORCH DAY

KYM a darkly beautiful girl in her early 20s is
smoking

furiously on the porch of an URBAN HALFWAY HOUSE She
glances

impatiently at her watch and presses her ear to her cell
phone As she exhales WE HEAR the rumble of thunder

Irritated she crams her cell phone into her bag
ROSA a halfway house staff nurse is patiently handling
WALTER an irate patient who is screeching

WALTER
I want my fucking Zippo now
Walter starts yanking at his hair

ROSA
Walter that is a behavior

WALTER
(raking his nails against
his forearm)
Fuck you

ROSA
And you are making a choice
Her cell phone rings

ROSA
(to Walter)
Hold onHello

WALTER

your lighter because youll torch
the Self-Help library again

WALTER

Kym grinds her cigarette under her heel and blows smoke

but

RACHEL

Kym stung exhales a plume of smoke

EMMA
Ive known the bride her entire
life Not biblically except for
that one time we french kissed at
Evan Yasskys party in the ninth
grade

SIDNEY
Film I want film
Whoops and hollers

EMMA
Commence embarrassing story

RACHEL
That wasnt it

EMMA
Rach do you remember the time I
was teaching you to drive in the
Wagoneer and you sideswiped that
taxi driver and knocked off his
side mirror

RACHEL
I have no memory of that
whatsoever

EMMA
Do you remember trying to outrun

him and leading him on a high speed

chase across 96th street

RACHEL
Gotta say no

Abby

EMMA
Well I would like to share with
everyone that Miss Rachel-before
she got her license or even had any
idea how to drive- out maneuvered
an irate screaming cab driver
across 96th street to the East
river handily avoiding two EMT
guys loading an old lady ona
gurney while at the same time
applying Cocofudge Lip Gloss in the
rearview mirror

Bravos all around

EMMA
Wait wait She actually got the
number of one of the EMT guys and
went out with him Twice

KYM
(loudly)
Was that the guy with the peroxide
hair

not looking at her daughter shushes her

EMMA
Anyway when the taxi driver
finally caught up with us Rachel
talked him down from his Middle
Eastern fury in pretend Farsi and
ended up using his radio thing to
call his dispatcher and recommend
this guy for a commendation

RACHEL
Mahamoud Such a nice man

EMMA
We were driving so fast It was one
of the more exhilarating moments in
my lifesadlybut I knew that

stage She

Miss Rachel would make it okay So
heres to you my dear dear
friend A woman who can drive fast
pick up a paramedic make up
languages and get you home in one
piece Sidney you are a lucky
bastard

SIDNEY
Hear hear

RACHEL
Where Where

Abby smiles broadly at Rachel and blows her a kiss

Kym rises with her glass and takes Emmas place on

glows in the candlelight

KYM
(for the crowd)
Relax its seltzer
Low giggles

KYM (CONTD)
Hello Im Shiva the destroyer and
your harbinger of doom for the
evening I want to thank you all
and

for coming and welcome you even
though I havent seen most of you
since my latest stretch in the Big
House

Scattered low giggles

KYM (CONTD)
You all look fabulous During the
twenty minutes I was not in the
hole for making a shiv out of my
toothbrush I actually did
participate in the infamous 12 Step
program 12 Steps Step-ball-
change step-ball-change Im still
waiting for the change part

Some guests laugh Sidney grins Carol Paul Rachel

Abby sit silently Andrew moves in towards his wife

KYM (CONTD)
But as they say relapse is an
almost always inevitable component
of recovery God knows Ive got
high marks in that mode

Everyone is staring at Kym

KYM (CONTD)
Anyhoo as more of you know than
are likely to admit one of the
actual steps is about making
amends

(MORE)

KYM (CONTD)
So I spent a lot of time calling up
people who barely remembered me -
who barely remembered anything -
and apologizing to them for
bouncing a check or passing out in
the bathtub and flooding their
house or otherwise involving them
in sordid activities they were
desperately trying to forget I had
to call this one girl who was I
think fourteen but I couldnt
talk to her because her Mom took
out a restraining order

Kym thinks this is hysterical Paul does not

KYM (CONTD)
Anyway I did a lot of apologizing
to people who were practically
strangers so I very much want to
take this opportunity to not only
congratulate my extraordinary
sister the future explorer in
matters of the mind thank you very
much and her adorable impending
husband on the occasion of their
unprecedented nuptials but also
to apologize to my extraordinary
sister the future explorer in
matters of the mind for
Everything And I really mean that
Rachel Ive been a nightmare and
youve been a saint Im so damned
glad Im here with you and Sidney
and his family and ours and I am
so happy for you guys I really am
So I am hereby raising my seltzer
in celebration of my laudatory
sister and herewith making amends
Sidney you are robbing our
dysfunctional family of one of its
most vital ingredients and its

only member still willing to lend
me money (She pauses for a second)
Enjoy Hawaii La Chaim

She lifts her glass and downs its contents There is a
smattering of applause

KYM (CONTD)
(to the group)
One down Whats for dessert

acknowledging my disease And now
watch me be really selfless and
weave a lovely blanket apology to
my sister for being a tad out of
her loop
Rachel giggles

Sidney and Kieran staying out of this exchange a
glance

KYM
(chewing)
Youre so cynical Dad since when
has she been this cynical

PAUL
Shes making an effort Rachel

RACHEL
An effort Thats what it was
Because I think she presumes that
since everything has always
revolved around her disease
everything else is going to revolve
around her recovery Thats what I
think

PAUL
Rachel She just got home

RACHEL
Again

KYM
I had no idea you were so angry

RACHEL
(turning her head)
You people You mean the people in
this room Your family

KYM
All of you people living in this
little world of judgement and
paranoia and mistrust I can feel
it every second At the slightest
sign of ingratitude or absence of
atonement its like the freaking
Salem Witch Trials around here I
might as well be

PAUL
(pouncing)
Dont even start

CAROL
(standing next to her
husband)
Nobody can make you feel any way
unless you let them Kym

KYM
Thank you Carol for your
inevitable pearl of wisdom but you

times a day You try living under
Dads constant monitoring for five
minutes and see how you like it

PAUL
What constant monitoring

KYM
Tll drive you Carol shes

RACHEL
Please Thats hardly news You may
not know thissure you dothe

only way to engage Dad in any
meaningful communication is to
start the conversation with your
name Have you heard from Kym
Hows Kym It resuscitates him It
jars him into the moment Like an
alarm

PAUL
Thats unfair Rachel And
completely untrue

RACHEL
And shes even worse Dad youre
never going to believe this but I
lost the car again Dad youre
never going to believe this but
that check you sent me never showed
up and my landlord hates me Dad
can somebody meet me downstairs
with cab fare and youre never
going to believe this but I need to
go to the emergency room and my
neighbors suing me and my
checkbook got stolen

KYM
Gee Rach sounds like you have
some paternalsibling issues to
work through

RACHEL
Are you kidding The two of you are
like a double helix of crises In
the language of psychology one
could say you both suffer from
acute boundary issues

PAUL
Rachel Its nice that youre
getting your PhD--
RACHEL
(she throws up her hands)
--Oh god--

PAUL
--but dont be patronizing Its
ugly It doesnt become you

RACHEL
How come she gets to spout off
about paternal issues but god
forbid I should even reference the
boundary thing even though I
actually know what Im talking
about

KYM
(waving her arms)
Hello By the way Im not in
crisis I havent been in crisis
for a year

RACHEL
You just got out of rehab

KYM
Why is this so difficult for you
people to understand Its like
youre not happy unless Im in some
kind of desperate situation You
have no idea what to do with me
unless Im desperate God Why am I
the only one whos willing to say
this stuff

RACHEL
Oh poor you Youre so much more
evolved in your suffering You know

most important thing in the world
to everybody
