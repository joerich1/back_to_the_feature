FLASHBACK

INT EDUCATION CENTER - CLASSROOM DAY - JEAN RASCZAK

40 a rugged teacher who proudly displays his missing hand
scowls at Johnny from the front of the classroom bemused

RASCZAK
-pay attention

Johnny looks up from his desk sheepish covering something hes
working at on his TouchPad screen

JOHNNY
Sorry Mr Rasczak

When Rasezak continues Johnny goes back to work

RASCZAK
Lets sum up This year we
explored the failure of democracy
caused by social scientists who
brought the world to the brink of
chaos We talked about how the
veterans took control and imposed
a stability that has lasted for
generations since

Johnny draws an ANIMATED CARTOON CARTOON JOHNNY and CARMEN
against the stars coming together for a kiss
RASCZAK
You know these facts but have I
taught you anything of value this
year You Why are only
citizens allowed to vote

Rasezak points at another student LANNY with his stump

LANNY
Its a reward what the
Federation gives you for doing
Federal Service

Rasczak is crestfallen makes a big show of patience

RASCZAK
No Something given has no
value Havent I taught you
dimwits anything I guess they
oughta revoke my teaching
credential

Laughter Behind him DIZZY FLORES 18 athletic and pretty
tries to get a look at what hes doing

RASCZAK
When you vote youre exercising
political authority Youre
using force And force my
friends is violence the supreme
authority from which all other
authority derives

CARL JENKINS 18 superintelligent jumps in

CARL
Gee we always thought you were
the supreme authority Mr
Rascezak

Laughter Rasczak grins

RASCZAK
In my classroom you bet
Whether its exerted by ten or
ten billion political authority
is violence by degree The
people we call citizens have
earned the right to wield it

Dizzy baits Rasczak playfully
DIZZY

My mother always says that
violence never solves anything
RASCZAK
Really JI wonder what the city
fathers of Hiroshima would have
to say about that You

Rasczak points at CARMEN IBANEZ 18 smart driven and certainly
the most beautiful girl at school

CARMEN
They probably wouldnt say
anything Hiroshima was
destroyed

Johnny presses SEND on his desk and the animation appears
across the way on Carmens screen

RASCZAK
Correct Naked force has settled
more issues in history than any
other factor The contrary
opinion violence never solves
anything is wishful thinking at
its worst

Carmen grins at the kissing cartoon enters changes on her touch
screen

RASCZAK
People who forget that always
pay They pay with their lives

and their freedom
Rasczak notices Johnnys distracted point to him with his stump

RASCZAK
You Tell me the moral
difference if any between the
citizen and the civilian

JOHNNY
The difference lies in the field
of civic virtue A citizen
accepts personal responsibility
for

Johnny glances down atthe cartoon sees that cartoon Carmen is
now blowing a big bubble that blocks the amorous advance of
cartoon Johnny

JOHNNY
the safety of the body
politic défending it with his
life The civilian does not

RASCZAK
The exact words of the text But
do you understand it Do you
BELIEVE it

Inevitably the bubble blows up in cartoon Johnnys face

JOHNNY
Uh I dont know

Carmen turns mischievious sticks her tongue out at Johnny

RASCZAK
Of course you dont I doubt if
any of you here would recognize
‘civic virtue if it bit you on
the ass

A bell rings Rasczak shrugs indifferent
RASCZAK
Well thats it the end of
another school year Have a nice
life
EXT EDUCATION CENTER HALLWAY -- DAY - JOHNNY

JOHNNY

Carmen returns to Johnny as Carl heads off

Johnny puts his arm around Carmen

JOHNNY

DIZZY

Biology

INT BIOLOGY LAB -- DAY -- THE BIOLOGY TEACHER

is older very spry also blind She uses a clear plastic cane
to navigate among twenty covered lab tables Johnny and Carmen
take one table Dizzy and Carl another

BIOLOGY TEACHER
For our final today please
identify the mouthparts the
abdominal organs and for extra
credit locate the nerve cord and
count the ganglia You may
begin

The students remove the covers to reveal large alien bugs 60
centimeter ARKELLIAN SAND BEETLES then wrestle the big dead
insects onto their backs for dissection Carmen is disgusted

CARMEN
Eeuch

JOHNNY
Aw comon its just a bug
Better put your goggles on

Johnny slices the abdomen open Green fluid sprays

BIOLOGY TEACHER
Just a bug huh We humans like
to think we are Natures finest
achievement Im afraid it isnt
true This Arkellian Sand Beetle
is superior in many ways
13A

Johnny applies a spreader and jacks the insects abdominal cavity
open with a resounding crack Bug guts gush out Carmen looks
away quickly concentrates on the teacher

BIOLOGY TEACHER
it reproduces in vast numbers
has no ego doesnt know about
death and so is the perfect
selfless member of society

CARMEN
But humans have created art
mathematics and interstellar
travel

Dizzy innocently waves an amputated bug leg in Carmens face
Carmen turns away looking ill —

BIOLOGY TEACHER
True but before you let that go
to your head take the example of
the Arachnids a highly
organized highly evolved insect
society

She pushes a button on her cane and a hologram of a two meter
tall ARACHNID WARRIOR appears at the front of the classroom

BIOLOGY TEACHER
By human standards they are
relatively stupid but their
evolution stretches over millions
of years and now they can
colonize planets by hurling their
spore into space

Johnny pulls strange looking insect organs out of the abdominal
cavity and throws them into the lab sink

JOHNNY
Well if thats the crop that
must be the gastric caecal

CARMEN
Excuse me

She heads for the door hand over her mouth

INT TRANSPORTER - PLATFORM - DAY CARMEN

Johnnys face darkens with frustration

JOHNNY
Oh comon Whats his

CARMEN

scratch his neck

JOHNNY
He just wants attention You

Carl concentrates for a moment

CARL
Go bug Mom Cyrano

Cyranos eyes widen He bolts out of Johnnys hands scurrying
across the floor and racing up the stairs

JOHNNY
How do you make him do that

CARL
I gave him the impression that

moms leg Hes on a mission to
go eat it

From upstairs CARLS MOM shrieks

Roughnecks jump off the walls Ace miraculously avoids the
deadly jaws of an attacking warrior but the less fortunate third
Roughneck is hooked from behind and hurled back over the compound
wall

Johnny and Dizzy open fire on the warrior and kill it as it
charges down the rampart at them

RASCZAK

The Roughnecks pull back into a semi-circle that affords them 180
degrees of kill zone

The Roughnecks methodically kill warriors as they pile over the

warriors to pieces

Fire and fall back

Roughnecks fall back and fire The tower gunners slide down the
tower ladder The retrieval boats hatch ratchets open and
Zander Barcalow steps out with a Morita to lay down cover fire

RASCZAK

Suddenly the deck plates beneath Rasczaks feet erupt and he
loses his balance SOMETHING HUGE punches up out of the ground
then withdraws The ground caves in beneath him

Rasezak struggles to climb out but something grabs him from
under the ground and pulls him down

RASCZAK
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAAAAA

Johnny and Dizzy struggle to pull Rasczak free There is a
grizzly snap Johnny falls back and Rasczak minus his legs
falls on top of him

RASCZAK
You know what to do Rico

JOHNNY
Yes sir

Johnny climbs to his feet swings his Morita down toward Rasczak
A look Johnny lets go a burst turns away bitterly as

The ground SHAKES and opens with tremendous force A TANKER BUG
pushes up into the compound clawing at the ground with huge legs
to pull its abdomen out of the ground

Johnny and Dizzy run for the retrieval boat Dizzy pulls out a
grenade and pops the cap The tanker struggles up its head
coming down to spray Dizzy turns and hurls the grenade and hits
it dead in the mouth

rushes to Dizzy

Blood pours out of her wounds Johnny tries to stop the blood
with his hand The life is leaving her eyes

JOHNNY
Hang on Diz dont die on

Johnny picks her up Ace is there to lend a hand They carry her
across the compound with other Roughnecks who continue to fire at
the bugs as they fall back

(5 meters) with huge vestigial legs It moves across the cavern
on a shifting carpet of chariot bugs

the giant insects two sets of eyes

claw and she lands in a heap at the brain bugs feet on top of

palp coming down toward her She grabs the knife from Zanders
boot slashing out cutting the palp in two

spraying out It moves back on its enormous legs clicking
commands

with the knife
