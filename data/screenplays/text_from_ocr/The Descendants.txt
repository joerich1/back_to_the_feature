EXT THE OCEAN - DAY

CLOSE ON a beautiful 40-YEAR-OLD WOMAN at the helm of a
powerful SPEEDBOAT -- her hair tossed back by the wind her
mouth in a euphoric grin

FADE OUT

CREDITS -- ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE

MATT (VO)
My missionary ancestors came to the
islands and told the Hawaiians to put
on clothes work hard believe in
Christ and stop surfing and hula
dancing They made business deals
along the way -- buying an island or
marrying a princess and inheriting her
land Now their descendants wear
bikinis and running shorts play beach
volleyball and surf and take up hula
dancing Hawaii has always been a
place of contradiction

EXT HONOLULU - DAY

VARIOUS SHOTS of Honolulu begin a pattern of montages to be
interspersed throughout the film

MATT (VO)
My friends on the mainland think just
because I live in Hawaii I live in
paradise Like a permanent vacation --
were all just out here drinking mai-
tais shaking our hips and catching
waves Are they nuts How can they
possibly think our families are less
screwed up our heart attacks and
cancers less fatal our grief less
devastating Hell I havent been on a
rr

surfboard in fifteen years

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

We ZOOM BACK from a panorama of Honolulu to find 50-year-old
MATT KING seated amid DOCUMENTS atop a makeshift desk -- he
has brought his work with him

MATT (VO)
For the last 23 days Ive been living
in a paradise of IVs and urine bags
and endotracheal tubes and six-month-
old US magazines Paradise Paradise
can go fuck itself

Matt looks up at the WOMAN we saw in the speedboat now lying
stiffly on an upright HOSPITAL BED her head cocked to one
side a feeding tube in her nose a ventilator in her
trachea IVs in her arm

MATT (VO) (CONTD)
This is Elizabeth King my wife
Twenty-three days ago she was launched
from a powerboat during a race and hit
her head almost drowned Now shes in
a coma that scores 5 on the Glasgow
scale and 3 on the Rancho Los Amigos
scale scores showing an extremely
severe coma Liz is very competitive
Whatever she does she does to the
fullest

INT NEUROLOGISTS OFFICE - DAY

Matt is getting the current DIAGNOSIS

NEUROLOGIST
She reacts non-purposefully to stimuli
in a non-specific manner but
occasionally her responses are
specific though inconsistent Her
reflexes are primitive and often the
same regardless of stimuli
presented

MATT (VO)
It was exactly what Elizabeth used to
accuse me of

6 INT HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Matt continues to observe her

MATT (VO)
Twenty-three days in a coma and any
day now the doctors will give me their
final verdict if shes going to come
out of it or not Then I have a
decision to make Wait thats wrong
Liz has a living will

INT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

A SCRAPBOOK
shows PHOTOS OF ELIZABETH lying in her hospital bed The
compositions are odd the ANGLES uncomfortably CLOSE
WIDE --

Matt confers with fifth-grade teacher MS Hayashi and school
counselor MRS THULL

MS HAYASHI
We just dont think these photographs
are appropriate for Scottie to be
sharing with her classmates Some of
them went home quite disturbed and we
got some angry calls from parents

MATT
Yeah shes sort of been going to town
with the whole picture-taking thing
but I had no idea --

MS HAYASHI
I cant tell you how my heart goes out
to you and your family but Scottie
just hasnt been herself Principal
Cruz agrees with us that it maybe would
be better for Scottie to remain at home
with you during this difficult time

MATT
Home See I would think that sticking
to her normal routine would be the best

thing for her -- you know keep her

occupied I wouldnt really know how

to

MATT (CONTD)
I mean Ive kind of got my hands full
And her sisters away at school on the
Big Island I dont think Scottie
would really want to hang out with me
when she could be with her friends and
people like you who specialize in
children

MRS THULL
Mr King we see this every day --
children acting out at school when
somethings wrong at home And your
family is facing a devastating crisis
Have you been engaging Scottie in
really talking about whats going on
Encouraging her to express her
feelings Thats crucial

MATT
(No)
Oh yeah Yeah Absolutely

SCOTTIE (0S)
(singing)
This shit is bananas B-a-n-a-n-a-s
This shit is bananas

They look over to see --

TEN-YEAR-OLD SCOTTIE KING --

EARBUDS in place and in her own world DANCING just outside
the classroom door A JANITOR down the hall eyes her
suspiciously

SCOTTIE (CONTD)
This shit is bananas B-a-n-a-n-a-s

Matt stares aghast at this specimen called his daughter The
ladies glance between Scottie and Matt wondering when or
whether hell intervene Finally --

MS HAYASHI
Scottie that is not a good choice
Are you making a good choice

Scottie remains oblivious Ms Hayashi rises to her feet
MATT
(realizing)
Yeah Scottie come on Knock it off

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
FLASH

Scottie takes Elizabeths picture again

MATT
I wish youd stop doing that And

time you should talk to her Im
tired of asking you You heard Dr
Johnston -- people in a coma can hear
you -- you know well some of them
can It lets them know theyre still
loved might even help them wake up
sooner And itll help you express
whatever feelings and emotions youre
supposed to be going through -- you
now make you feel better

SCOTTIE

MATT
Tell her a story

SCOTTIE

EXT BRIEF MONTAGE - DAY

Images lead us up the PALI HIGHWAY and into the lush old
neighborhood of NUUANU

EXT KING HOUSE - DAY

This STATELY OLD HOUSE shows signs of neglect but feels
impressive and welcoming nonetheless

MATT (0S)
Is this Barb Higgins

BARB HIGGINS (0S)
Yes it is

MATT (0S)
Hi Matt King returning your call I
assume your daughter is a classmate of
my daughters

The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 41110 Draft

BARB HIGGINS (0S)

INT KING HOUSE - DAY

As Matt speaks on the PHONE he wanders out of his cluttered

HOME OFFICE and into the DINING ROOM

MATT
How can I help you

BARB HIGGINS (0S)

Lets see where to start Its
Scottie Shes been texting some awful
things to Lani and Id like her to
stop

MATT
For instance

BARB HIGGINS (0S)
Heres the latest one We all know
you grew pubes over the summer She
sends little messages like that for no
reason She even wrote it on Lanis
Facebook wall

MATT
Huh

BARB HIGGINS (0S)
She calls my daughter Lanikai implying
shes like the size of an entire
neighborhood Do you think thats
nice

MATT
Thats not like her at all Shes
usually very sweet

He glances out the window at Scottie who sits on the ground
back turned POUNDING something with a BIG ROCK

MATT (CONTD)
As you may know her mother isnt well
and maybe this is how shes dealing
with it

BARB HIGGINS (0S)
I dont care about the backstory Mr
King My daughter comes home from
school in tears

The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 41110 Draft
17

MATT
Yeah no I get it Im very sorry

BARB HIGGINS (0S)
Scottie should be the one whos sorry
I want her to come over and apologize
to Lani and I dont ever want her to
write to my daughter again

LANI (DISTANT OS)
She can in a good way

BARB HIGGINS (0S)
If she doesnt apologize Im going to
tell the headmaster You cant buy
your way out of this

Matt draws a long exasperated breath as if everything else
werent enough already

MATT (VO)
See what I mean Everybody sees me as
the rich guy the inheritor People
resent us I resent us Even our last
name -- King How irritating

18 INT MATTS CAR - DAY

Matt drives Scottie

MATT
You need to say youre sorry and you
need to mean it No dicking around I
have a ton of work to do tonight Do
you have any idea how behind I am
You made her cry Why would you want
to be so mean to someone

SCOTTIE
(irritated)
I dont know

MATT
Is that what you text all the time
nasty things

SCOTTIE
No

MATT
Well what then

The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 41110 Draft
18

SCOTTIE
I write them with Reina They make her
laugh and then she shows Megan and
Brooke and they laugh too

MATT
I should have known Reina had something
to do with it I dont want you
hanging out with her

SCOTTIE
Wait I told Reina she could visit me
in the hospital since Im not in school
anymore Can she

MATT
Well make a deal You apologize to
this girl and you talk to your mother
and then well see about Reina dropping
by the hospital Okay
Something outside the window catches Scotties attention

SCOTTIE
Dorks

Matt looks to see --

SIX FAMILY MEMBERS

Melnick Family Reunion

SCOTTIE (CONTD)

MATT

Scottie sits back in her seat laughing Matt glances in his

and throwing it to the ground

19 EXT LANIS HOUSE - KAIMUKI - LATE AFTERNOON

SCOTTIE

MATT

SCOTTIE

and Brooke and got popular

MATT

EXT LANIS FRONT PORCH - LATE AFTERNOON

BARB HIGGINS answers the door

BARB HIGGINS
Thank you for coming by

INT LANIS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

As Matt and Scottie are shown inside they remove their
shoes

BARB HIGGINS
I forgot to mention the time Scottie
said she didnt want to be Lanis
partner at the rock wall because she
didnt want to fall into my daughters
butt crack That doesnt even make
sense

Barb now leads them into --
THE TV ROOM --
-- where LANI HIGGINS sits on a couch Matt is impatient
be done with this meaningless task
MATT
Scottie do you have something you want

to say to Lani

SCOTTIE
Sorry

The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 41110 Draft
21

LANI
Its okay

MATT
Great Well nice meeting you both
Lani you should come over sometime
Come for a swim or a hike or something

BARB HIGGINS
Scottie the things you said were
simply evil Do you realize that I
dont know whats led you to be such a
nasty young lady

MATT
Hey hey We came over She
apologized Were dealing with it
Kids are mean sometimes They grow out
of it Its a kid thing Here
Scottie youre going to stop right
And youre really really sorry right

Scottie makes a big exaggerated nod

BARB HIGGINS
I dont think shes sorry at all
Shes going to keep doing it I can
tell

MATT
No she wont Its like the time Lani
locked Scottie out of the house at her
birthday party and Scottie sat outside
by herself It was a mean thing to do
but Lani here probably did it just to
show off right

Lani thinks a moment nods

MATT (CONTD)
But Im not about to declare that one
action defines a human beings entire
character Shes a work in progress
and like all complex people is a bundle
of contradictions
BARB HIGGINS
I didnt know about that

SCOTTIE
You brought me cake

The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 41110 Draft
21 MATT
You brought her cake So I dont
know maybe Lani should be the one to
apologize since this incident may have
been the catalyst for all this
evil was the word you used
22 EXT LANIS HOUSE - DUSK

The door opens and Matt and Scottie pause to slip their
shoes back on
BARB HIGGINS
Oh and Mr King
MATT
Yes
BARB HIGGINS
Good luck with the sale
Matt turns to look at her So thats what all this was about

on some level

BARB HIGGINS (CONTD)
They say your decision will have a
major impact on Hawaiis real estate

landscape of Kauai Hundreds of
millions of dollars yeah

MATT

with her haole banker and estate
manager Edward King whose parents

were missionaries Between

his land

deals and her huge inheritance all of
their descendants for generations have
watched the past unfurl millions into

our laps through leases and sales Now
the Rule Against Perpetuities is
forcing us to dissolve the trust and
were selling the last parcel of
undeveloped land

Matt looks up his glance falling on the portraits of Edward
and Margaret

MATT (VO) (CONTD)
Soon my daughters and I can just be

view of DOWNTOWN We glimpse his Punahou college and law
school DIPLOMAS

MATT (VO)
Unlike a lot of my cousins I havent
touched my share of the trust money
Like my father before me I live only
on the income from my law practice I
dont want my daughters growing up
entitled and spoiled And I agree with
my father -- you give your children
enough money to do something but not
enough to do nothing

Matts secretary NOE cracks open his door

NOE
Mr King your cousins are here

INT LAW OFFICE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Matt enters the room to find SEVEN COUSINS waiting to greet
him From their casual clothing and shaggy hair an observer
might hardly suspect their status

MATT (VO)
Not only am I the sole but Ima
commercial real estate and
transactional attorney so the most
involved of my cousins have been
meeting with me regularly to analyze
the bids -- Cousin Dave Cousin Hal
Cousin Six Cousin Wink Cousin Lisa
Cousin Connie and Cousin Stan both of
whom oppose the sale entirely Dont
be fooled by appearances In Hawaii
some of the most powerful people look
like bums and stuntmen

LATER --

Matt and his cousins stand above the conference table
looking at blueprints and architectural drawings

MATT (VO) (CONTD)
The proposals are virtually the same --
hotels shopping centers condos and
golf courses 3000 new jobs in the

DR JOHNSTON
Bad news Matt Dr Chun Dr Mueller
and I -- we believe her condition
which we call a multi-factorial anoxic
encephalopathy is deteriorating We
see no eye movement no pupillary
response basically no brainstem
reflexes whatsoever The machines
could keep her going but her quality

of life would be very poor

Basically what you see now Shell
never be like she was Matt Never

We know that now
Matt sits very still

DR JOHNSTON (CONTD)
I cant tell you how sorry I am to have
to tell you this And you have your
daughters Theres just nothing we can
do

MATT
So if we do go ahead and take her
off the machines --

DR JOHNSTON
Not if Matt When I have a legal
obligation You know that

The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 41110 Draft

MATT
How long will she last

DR JOHNSTON
Hard to say Could be a few days
Could be two weeks But for planning
purposes you should work off the
shortest possible scenario I know I
need to get the ball rolling on organ
donations right away

Organ donation Forgot about that one

DR JOHNSTON (CONTD)
Elizabeth has so many friends a big
life Last time I was at your house
must have been 200 people If youre
going to let people know to say
goodbye which is fairly typical
protocol in these situations start
now By the time the last day comes
they feel more ready as ready as they
can feel Im so sorry Matt

The guy notices the Kings and feels obliged to mosey over

This is TROY COOK -- athletic and rich
TROY

thought that was an encouraging sign

Scottie looks up hopefully Matt notices

MATT
Thats enough

TROY
I really think she heard me

MATT
Look Troy go to your friends No

alone

Troy walks away stops turns back

TROY

water

MATT

TROY
She wanted me to drive And shes the
one who told me to pass the other boat
right before the turn And just your
whole attitude toward me Matt -- I

me and not her Plus I almost drowned
myself when we capsized And my
rotator cuff is never going to be the
same and Im going to miss Molokai

happened and I was waiting until she
woke up I guess And you you didnt
even suspect Right

MATT
Caught her with some guy What does

MARK
Stupid

KAI
Its not stupid He wants us to throw
parties and have people over which we
do of course but who ends up doing
all the work Me

MARK
Its work thats totally unnecessary
You dont have to do anything
Nobodys forcing you to clean and buy a
new outfit and think of some goddamn
theme cocktail We can just invite
people over last minute and drink
whatever we have and hang out Its
more fun that way anyway

As they continue their argument Matt is struck by the
pettiness of everyday life He at once pities it is
impatient with it and longs for it

MARK (CONTD)
You know what We can talk about it
later Matt didnt come over to hear
us squabble

KAI
Shit Matt Is Elizabeth -- is there
any news

The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 41110 Draft

defend herself Matt you may not be
able to hear this right now but its
not her fault Women have needs

MATT
Are you fucking kidding me

The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 41110 Draft
54 KAI
Your marriage was not You worked so

hard to make partner and no one can
take that away from you But then you
made partner and you only got busier
And its not like you were so involved
with the girls She was lonely
MATT
So youre going to talk to me in
clichés about women Nothing is ever a
womans fault Was it still going on
when she had the accident

Kai looks away Mark nods

MARK
But I stayed out of it Matt Anytime
Kai talked about it I walked away

MATT

(to Kai)
And you what You probably egged her
on Add some drama to your life
without any actual risk Whom do you
think youre protecting anyway She
doesnt need your protection -- its
over Shes going to die

KAI
Dont say that

MATT
I almost told you yesterday Shes
never going to wake up Its for sure
now You hear me Were pulling the
plug You were putting lipstick ona

corpse

MARK
Come on Matt Thats a little
intense

Kais face dissolves into tears Mark reaches out to comfort
her Everybody falls back to Earth

MATT
Im sorry I didnt mean to take it
out on you guys I just Does she

Matt looks at him blankly then at Kai Hed like to know
too

The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 41110 Draft

KAI

How can you ask about him when shes
going to die Who cares Yes she
loves him loved him whatever Shes

revealed blows a calming wind
MATT
You still havent told me who he is I
guess it doesnt matter

lived more in a year than you did ina
decade sitting in your office
hoarding all your cash All that money
you refuse to use -- what the hell good
is it And now you and your family are
cashing in your chips -- what the hell
for Maybe if youd let my baby have
her own boat and bought her some safe
equipment or let her go on those
shopping sprees women like maybe she
wouldnt have gone in for those thrill
sports Maybe if youd provided more
thrills at home

ALEXANDRA
Grandpa

SCOTT THORSON
And you Alexandra Putting your poor
mother through hell when all she was
trying to do was instill some sense and
drive in you Shame on you You

Hands on hips he looks up as though gauging the weather
Then he clears his throat wipes his face with his sleeve

bad for wishing a retarded person or an

71 INT HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY

As Matt leads his daughters toward Elizabeths room --

MATT
Let me go in for just a quick moment
alone first Ill be right out

72 INT HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Matt closes the glass door behind him and slides the privacy
curtain across it He looks at his wife Shes starting to
look different -- her face more gaunt her hair more matted

Since the last time we saw her OTHER ITEMS have been added
around her bed Along with draped LEIS we see a childhood
DOLL DIPLOMAS and of course SPORTS MEDALS and RIBBONS An
antique QUILT covers her legs Her father meant it when he
said theyd bring her old things

Matt crouches down bedside

MATT
You were going to ask me for a divorce
So you could be with some fucking
fuckhead Brian Speer Are you kidding
me Who are you Because the only
thing I know for sure is that youre a
goddamned liar So what do you have to

say for yourself Go ahead make a
little joke and tell me Ive got it all

wrong Tell me again Im too out of
touch with my feelings and need to go

to therapy
(then --)

Isnt the idea of marriage to make your
partners way in life a little easier
For me it was always harder with you
And youre still making it harder
Lying there on a ventilator and still
fucking up my life Youre relentless
You know what I was going to ask you
for a divorce some day

following her She even paddled up
onto the nearest rocks instead of all
the way to shore Got cuts all over
her legs and hands Only time I ever
saw your mother scared and she was
really scared She even threw up

Crying and shaking I had to hold her
for a long time She really thought
she was going to die Of course she

hid all that from the Mitchells turned
it into a funny Me-versus-a-shark
story I told her

SID (CONTD)

the sad news he just shared

MATT
Goodnight Sid Ill see you tomorrow

SID
Goodnight boss

102 EXT HANALEI BAY - DAWN

SUNRISE Matt JOGS along the nearly empty beach -- just a
few surf FISHERMAN and PADDLERS Hes clearly out of shape
but makes a good effort
ANOTHER GUY jogs toward Matt wearing a Stanford Lacrosse T-
shirt and running shorts with long slits up the sides
BRIAN SPEER
They pass each other Matt continues on a moment in
disbelief then TURNS AROUND and follows His strides long
and efficient Brian gives Matt a run for his money

The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 41110 Draft
102

Soon Brian cuts up the beach toward one of the COTTAGES that
line the bay Matt follows awkwardly trying to appear
nonchalant

MATT
(under his breath)
Hi you dont know me but I know you
Hi you dont know me but I know you
Brian Speer right Hi Im Lizs
husband Thats right Fuckface

Brian disappears up a little PATH through a HEDGE Matt
quickens his pace toward --

EXT HANALEI BEACH COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS

-- where he spies on Brian walking across a wide lawn toward
a lovely OLD COTTAGE

MATT
Hi You dont know me but I know you

Brian disappears inside emerging moments later chugging
GATORADE

Courage gathered Matt is about to charge forward when he
stops short -- the door opens again and out comes a
beautiful WOMAN in a white bathing suit and white sun hat
Then two LITTLE BOYS

Fuckers got a family Not the right moment

EXT HANALEI BAY - DAY

The sun is higher and the BEACH is growing populated

Matt sits on the sand glancing occasionally back toward the
cottage Next to him lie his daughters and Sid

Suddenly TWO BOYS -- Brians kids -- come running through the
hedge and past Matt on their way into the water

Matt turns around to see Brians wife JULIE SPEER dutifully
trailing behind

JULIE
Stay in the zone please That means
you Skylar And you too Colt

MATT
(low)
Skylar and Colt

Speer

Matt watches the little boys flop into the surf Mrs
follows wading in up to her calves

Matt stands to look whether Brian is coming down to the beach
too No such luck

MATT (CONTD)
(to Alex)
Ill be right back

Matt gets to his feet brushes off sand and walks casually
toward Mrs Speer maintaining a comfortable distance
Alexandra watches

IN THE SURF --

Matt takes up a casual stance near Mrs Speer and pretends to
look out at the water just hanging out Mrs Speer
continues to keep a watchful eye on her boisterous boys

MATT (CONTD)
Looks like you got yourself a handful
with those two

JULIE
Yeah

MATT

JULIE

a really fun age

MATT

Matt looks over to see Scottie very agitated about something

MATT

Matt trots off

A MONTAGE --

Images of Hanalei as the sun begins to set over the
magnificent taro fields Wind rustles the trees Mist falls
into the valley

MATT (VO)
How can I forgive her for loving
someone else Did she even know about
his family Was she that in love
Does she miss him from her coma Does
she wish he could be with her and not
me

EXT HANALEI TOWN - DUSK

The music grows more frenetic

Matt looks around the room alienated from everything -- from

the fried food and the tourists from the umbrellas in the

drinks from his daughters enjoying the music and this cretin

called Sid

Why cant a nuclear bomb blow the whole island up right now
108 EXT THE ROAD BY THE BAY - SUNSET

The light is swiftly fading and our heroes are little more

than SILHOUETTES as they walk back to the hotel

The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 41110 Draft
109 Brian seems deeply lost in his own thoughts Then --

BRIAN SPEER

JULIE

scrambles to keep the ball rolling

ALEXANDRA

MATT
Then I guess its all working out Her

go through the trouble of dumping her

BRIAN SPEER
Hey hey thats really unfair I had -

Shes a wonderful woman

MATT
Too bad her husband found out You

MATT
You could have had the decency to lie

Hospital if you want to say goodbye
That really is all I came to say

BRIAN SPEER
Shouldnt you be with her

Matts face slackens into overwhelming sadness

111 EXT HANALEI BAY COTTAGE - NIGHT

Matt swings the screen door open Alex sits with Julie
Skylar and Colt are still running around the yard

MATT
Yeah great all remodeled new
appliances Nice Alex we should be
getting back

JULIE
Well hey thanks for stopping by
Really nice to meet you both Maybe
well see you at the beach tomorrow

The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 41110 Draft
111

ALEXANDRA

Yeah maybe

After Alex and Julie share a quick kiss goodbye -- a common
custom in Hawaii -- Julie turns to Matt

Matt leans in but instead of going for her cheek he kisses
her FULLY ON THE LIPS

He pulls away and they exchange a brief vaguely erotic
look Then he turns away and into the night

112 INT AIRPLANE - NIGHT

The plane is dark except for overhead READING LIGHTS Again
Matt Sid and the girls sit at the very BACK OF THE PLANE

ALEXANDRA
So when do you think hell show up

MATT
I have no idea

Sid leans forward from the middle seat

SID
Was he sorry I hope he was sorry
man You could have told his wife and
you didnt I hope he knows how lucky
he is I would have told her
everything She deserves to know Or
else shes going to be a dumb bitch the
rest of her life

ALEXANDRA
Sid

SID
Im just saying

MATT
No need to get creepy Anyway doesnt
matter Thats all behind us
ALEXANDRA
Yeah the one we have to worry about
telling things to now is Scottie

MATT
Ive asked Dr Johnston to help us
break the news tomorrow

The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 41110 Draft
112

They turn to look at little Scottie dead to the world in the
window seat

INT HOSPICE HALLWAY - DAY

Matt and the kids walk slowly through this different calmer
wing of the hospital looking for the right room-number

Finally they find it and push open the door into --

INT HOSPICE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

While still a hospital room there is no medical equipment
present Bucolic colorful paintings on the wall are intended
to be uplifting But unlike the expansive view outside
Elizabeths ICU window here the window looks out partially
at a CINDER-BLOCK WALL

Sid and the Kings are greeted by DR JOHNSTON and grief
counselor DR HERMAN who affects a comforting smile

DR JOHNSTON
Hello everyone Matt
(off their greetings)
This is Dr Herman whom I told you
about She works with us in
counseling

DR HERMAN
(locking eyes with all)
Hello everyone Hello Hi Hello
The two professionals allow the Kings to turn their attention
to Elizabeth who now lies with no machines at all Around
her BALLOONS droop FLOWERS wilt get-well CARDS lie ina
pile Elizabeth too is wilting and drooping Her skin is
pasty and her cheeks are hollow

SCOTTIE
How come Mom isnt on any more
machines Is she getting better

The adults exchange glances Dr Herman approaches Scottie

DR HERMAN

You must be Scottie

(off her nod --)
Scottie I have a present for you

Dr Herman hands her a little squeaky RUBBER OCTOPUS she
pulls from her pocket

The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 41110 Draft
114

DR HERMAN (CONTD)
Thats right Its an octopus Such a
funny creature with its eight legs
But did you know octopi are actually
extremely intelligent like dogs and
cats They have unique personalities
and just like us they have a lot of
defense mechanisms Im sure you know
about the ink sac She uses ink to
confuse her predators She can
camouflage herself She can emit
poison and some can mimic more
dangerous creatures like the eel I
keep her to remind me of our defense
mechanisms -- our ink our camouflage
our poison all the things we use to
keep away hurt The reason Dr
Johnston invited me here today is to
meet you Scottie Ive heard a lot
about you
SCOTTIE
Like what

DR HERMAN
Ive heard that youre a wonderful and
unique and spirited girl

Dr Herman shoots a look at Matt before continuing

DR HERMAN (CONTD)
And Ive heard your moms not doing too
well and that shes going to die very
soon

All watch Scottie react to this news

SCOTTIE
Dad is that true

MATT
Yes Scottie Its true

DR HERMAN
Youre going to have to be a very brave
girl right now and youre surrounded
by people who love you I came to meet
you and tell you that if you ever want
to talk about what youre feeling I
would like to talk to you too I can
help you face whats going on without
all the silly defense mechanisms that
work for an octopus but not for us

The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 41110 Draft
114 DR JOHNSTON
Okay Thank you Dr Herman

Dr Herman looks at everyone with great sincerity before
leaving Scottie is left holding the octopus She drops it
and it squeaks a little

ALEXANDRA
What the fuck was that

DR JOHNSTON
Yes well they say shes very good one-
on-one

SCOTTIE
So Moms going to die for sure

DR JOHNSTON
Yes We worked really hard with her
but three other doctors and I agree
shes in what we call an irreversible
coma Do you know what that means

SCOTTIE
It means she doesnt have a brain
anymore

DR JOHNSTON
Not exactly but yes thats the
general idea So were doing exactly
what she wanted us to do if that ever
happened Thats why shes not
attached to the machines anymore

ALEXANDRA
Its for the best Scottie Look at
her Shes not happy like this

DR JOHNSTON
The purpose of medicine is to heal and
we cant do that now

MATT
Do you understand

SCOTTIE
Yes What will we do with her body

Dr Johnston looks to Matt for this one

The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 41110 Draft
114 MATT
First Moms going to give some of her
organs to other sick people so she can
help save their lives Thats a really
neat thing shes doing Then were
going to were going to scatter her
ashes in the ocean You know how Mom
always loved the ocean

SCOTTIE
Her ashes

Scottie looks at her mother picturing her as ashes

SCOTTIE (CONTD)
When will she die

DR JOHNSTON
Any day now Im afraid But you still
have some time

DR JOHNSTON (CONTD)
Well Let me know if you have any more
questions

MATT
Thanks Sam

The doctor leaves and the room is quiet Scottie is ina
sort of trance

ALEXANDRA
Come here Scottie

Scottie goes to her sister who takes her in her arms

SCOTTIE
Do eyeballs burn

SID
Hey Scottie Dont think about stuff
like that

115 INT HOSPICE ROOM - THE NEXT DAY

Matt and the kids sit in a sort of vigil Alex and Scottie
read books Matt has brought some paperwork Sid reads a
magazine

Elizabeth emits a SIGH All look up a moment before looking
back down

The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 41110 Draft

Matts PHONE VIBRATES Checking the caller ID -- HUGH KING --
he opts not to answer
The door opens and Elizabeths brother BARRY THORSON
accompanies his parents Scott and Alice into the room
SCOTT THORSON
Here we are
(to Scottie)
Hi Bingo Alex
Cheerful Alice doesnt really get whats going on An
emotional Barry hugs Matt and the girls
SCOTT THORSON (CONTD)
(eyeing Sid)
There you are again
Matt and Alex maneuver seats for the Thorsons to sit near the
bed Barry gets his mother situated then takes a seat
himself
Remaining on his feet old Scott surveys his daughter froma
distance
SCOTT THORSON (CONTD)
So what did you decide
MATT
Theres not much left to decide Were
just sort of playing it by ear and
making sure shes comfortable
SCOTT THORSON
I mean what did you decide about the
buyer Whos your buyer
Even Sid and his daughters perk up at this question
Matt is

taken aback

SCOTT THORSON (CONTD)
How much are you getting
BARRY THORSON
Dad Im sure youll be able to read
about it in the paper

SCOTT THORSON
I dont need to read about it I can
hear about it right now

The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 41110 Draft
115 MATT
Scott lets not talk about that here
Its not the time for that

SCOTT THORSON
All the same to you I guess A
million here a million there Just
ironic thats all -- Elizabeth coming
into this misfortune just as youre
coming into a fortune She gave you
everything Matt A good happy home
two beautiful daughters

Matt looks to Barry for help but Barrys silence and
sheepish look imply he buys into his fathers propaganda

MATT
Scott whats your point

SCOTT THORSON
She wanted her own boat She should
have had her own boat one she would
have been familiar with

MATT
She wasnt even driving Her boat
someone elses boat -- it wouldnt have

made any difference Youre not going
to blame me for this

SCOTT THORSON
Sure sure quibble about the details
She was a faithful devoted wife She
deserved more

Why fight it

MATT
Youre right She deserved more

SID
For Christs sake take it easy on the
man

Scott turns to Sid like hes about to pop him again

ALEXANDRA
My father has been doing a really
amazing job under the circumstances

His point made Scott looks at Matt and the girls and
shuffles to Elizabeths bedside puts his hands on Alices
shoulder

The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 41110 Draft

-- where they take a few steps away

SID
Man that guys a prick Was he always
like that

MATT
Yep

Scottie has stayed behind to peek through a crack in the
door Noticing the others join her

THROUGH THE DOOR --

As Barry and Alice remain seated their backs to us Scott
stands above his daughter touching her arm eyes closed

SID
Is he praying

MATT
No

SCOTT THORSON
(opening his eyes)

Say goodbye to Elizabeth Alice

ALICE
Oh Goodbye Elizabeth

The old man puts his hand over his mouth and squeezes his
eyes shut Then he opens his eyes and places a hand on her
forehead smooths her hair back

WIDE --

Matt and his daughters watch without moving

INT KING HOUSE - MATTS STUDY - NIGHT

Matt sits at his desk lost in thought The only sound is the
tick-tock of an old clock reading 320 Then he gets up and
starts pacing shooting occasional glances at the BLUEPRINTS
and RENDERINGS atop his desk

DISSOLVE TO

EXT HIGHWAY OUTSIDE KING FAMILY SHARED PROPERTY - DAY

Matt turns off the highway and into a long driveway

INT KING FAMILY SHARED PROPERTY HOUSE - DAY

Matt opens all front doors and lanai doors letting air into
the old place He notices old PHOTOS OF KING ANCESTORS
120 EXT KING FAMILY SHARED PROPERTY - DAY

Matt walks around the property alone taking it in and
thinking Like everywhere in Hawaii the nature here is
powerful -- TREES BIRDS SPIDERWEBS
121 EXT KING FAMILY SHARED PROPERTY HOUSE - DAY

Matt plops heavily into a chair on the lanai
WIDER --
Matt alone

Amid drinks held aloft a CALABASH is passed among the
cousins into which the each places a folded BALLOT
Matt sits watching the proceedings with Cousin Hugh Cousin
Six and another ELDERLY COUSIN at a table piled with papers
and contracts

Matt Hugh and Six FINISH THE COUNT while others mill about
mingle drink -- an early celebration for all except for a
group of DISSENTERS off to one side

COUSIN HUGH

holdouts who dont want to sell at all

distant second Feels good

At least there aint going to be any
Wal-Mart Now its your call and
were all behind you most of us
anyway

(handing him a pen)
Go ahead Captain Make it official

MATT
Its strange thats all

COUSIN HUGH
Whats strange

MATT
We didnt do anything to own that land
It was entrusted to us And now were
just

Hugh and Six exchange a concerned look For a moment we go
VERY CLOSE on Matts eyes Then --

MATT (CONTD)
I cant do it I wont do it Im not
going to sign

COUSIN HUGH

know you have a lot on your plate right

122

COUSIN SIX
Its inevitable Matt You know that
Well get out of debt -- the taxes and
maintenance have been leaching us for
far too long

The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 41110 Draft

122

MATT
I dont want it to go to Holitzer I
dont want it to go to anyone I want
to keep it

COUSIN SIX
For Christs sake We cant move
without your approval And we dont
want to

Hugh tries forcing Matts hand Matt resists

COUSIN HUGH
Your heads not right Mattie Your
heads not right You want a couple
days to think it over Take a couple
days

MATT
I dont need a couple days I have the
authority and this is what I want I
havent wanted something in a long
time We have other businesses were
converting to corporations We can
figure it out

COUSIN SIX
But its utterly unproductive land It
doesnt generate enough income to pay
the goddamn taxes

COUSIN HUGH
Youre the trustee You know better
than anyone we only have seven years
left

MATT
Then I have seven years to figure out
how to keep it

Cousin Hugh draws a long breath looks up at the sky then
back at Matt

COUSIN HUGH
Well come after you Just because
youre a lawyer doesnt mean the rest
of us would be afraid to come after
you But nobody wants to do that
Were family

The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 41110 Draft
122 MATT

People will be relieved Hugh the
whole state I sign that document
its over End of the line Something
that was ours to protect will be gone
Even though were haole as shit and go
to private schools and clubs and cant
even speak pidgin let alone Hawaiian
we still carry Hawaiian blood and
were still tied to this land And our
children are tied to this land Its a
miracle that for whatever bullshit
reason 150 years ago we own this much
of paradise but we do And for
whatever bullshit reason now Im the
trustee And Im not signing And if
you sue me itll only make us closer

Cousin Hugh releases a long breath more like a belch quickly
picks his nose exchanges a look with Cousin Six Then he
brings his fingers to his mouth to WHISTLE

COUSIN HUGH
All right everybody listen up
Cousin Mattie has an announcement Get
ready

Rising to his feet Matt scans the faces of his relatives

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

From the way Matt Sid and the girls are positioned around
the room we can tell their presence there is now way of
life Scottie snoozes on the little sofa We may notice
that Elizabeth is even more shrunken

A KNOCK is followed by --

A VASE OF FLOWERS
appearing in the doorway topped by blonde hair and held by
thin bronzed arms Its JULIE SPEER

MATT
Julie What are you doing here

He rises to help her find a spot to put the flowers She
nods to the girls

JULIE
I know we just met but I was thinking
about you guys these past few days and
I knew your mom was here I dont
know I just felt I should stop by

The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 41110 Draft

MATT
You remember Alex This is Scottie
Sid This is Mrs Speer

JULIE
Julie
SCOTTIE

JULIE
No we never met But I know a lot
about her

As they now do often Matt and Alex exchange a look

MATT
Well we appreciate your coming by
The flowers are lovely

SID
(heading to the door)
Scottie Alex Lets go to the
cafeteria

The girls follow Sids prompt leaving Matt alone with Julie
standing a dying woman between them

MATT
I uh Im not sure how much you know
about my wifes condition but shes
going to die very soon Any minute
really Thats sort of why were all
here

JULIE
I know Thats why I came Because I
know I came because my husband
wouldnt And that just didnt seem
right I thought someone from my
family should come

Wow

MATT
Im sorry I came to your house like
that Just barged in on you

JULIE
Its all right I assume youre angry
Of course you are Im angry too

The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 41110 Draft
123 MATT
So he told you huh

JULIE
After you left that night he was
acting really weird Then I started
smelling it all over him Id already
smelled it

MATT
Youre a woman

JULIE
I finally got it out of him Weve
been going crazy ever since Not easy
with the kids around Its all
something I never could have imagined
And then your familys decision about
the land I think youre doing the
right thing but Brian is -- well its
all so complicated and confusing

MATT
I know

JULIE
Brian told me everything Well how
can I ever know its everything When
did you find out Have you known for a
while

MATT
Just a few days ago

JULIE
Im angry but Im just so sorry I
cant imagine what youre going
through Do you mind if I say
something to her

Matt is unsure but what else can he do Julie approaches the
bed

JULIE (CONTD)
Elizabeth Im Julie Brians wife I
just want to say I forgive you I
forgive you for trying to take Brian
I forgive you for almost destroying my
family I have to forgive you Even
though I want to hate you

The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 41110 Draft
123 MATT
Okay All right Thats enough
Julie I think I think thats
enough
Matt walks to the door and opens it Alex and Sid -- whove
clearly had their ears against the door -- scamper away

unnoticed by Matt and Julie

MATT (CONTD)
He didnt love her Just so you know
He didnt really love her

JULIE
Thats why Im here

Julie heads to the door At the door she looks at Matt
Matt looks at her She leaves

Matt is left alone with his wife and he realizes suddenly
that this is his moment

He walks to the bed takes her hand rubs his palm over her
hair He says something to her as though silently praying
then realizes he should say it aloud

He presses his lips to hers and puts his hand on her stomach

MATT
Goodbye Elizabeth Goodbye my love
my friend my pain my joy Goodbye
Goodbye Goodbye

124 INT HOSPICE HALLWAY - DAY

The door to Elizabeths room opens and Alexandra emerges a
far-away sadness on her face She walks slowly toward --

A NEARBY WAITING AREA
-- where Matt sits with Scottie and Sid Matt and Sid rise
to comfort her but shes not in the mood She allows them
each to hug her briefly before turning to Scottie

Signaling to Matt to let her do this Alex escorts a fearful
Scottie toward Elizabeths room and reassuring her guides
her little sister inside

Matt and Sid are left alone

125 EXT MONTAGE - DAY

To be determined
111-
The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 41110 Draft

126 EXT THE OCEAN - DAY

PADDLES
in the water

A BOX ENCIRCLED BY LEIS
sits tied to the seat of a small outrigger CANOE

MATT AND THE GIRLS
navigate the canoe through the surf

SCOTTIE
How far do we have to go

MATT
Not that far Just past the break

ALEXANDRA
Steer straighter Dad And a little
faster okay

MATT
Im trying

127 LATER --

The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 41110 Draft

Matt and the girls simply FLOAT glancing from time to time
at the urn in Scotties lap In the distance loom the hotels

and high-rises of Waikiki

MATT
Well here we are just the four of us
For the last time
(then --)
Alex why dont you start Scottie

hand her the box

Scottie does so Alexandra takes the box reverently -- she

wants to perform this sad strange ceremony without messing

up

She opens the box and pulls out a scoop of ashes which
Scottie looks at unblinking Alex looks to Matt who gives
her the go-ahead and without further ceremony pours them

into the sea

THE ASHES
fall densely in one spot then slowly darken the water and

disappear
Alex looks down struck by the weirdness of it all before

glancing up at Matt

MATT (CONTD)

Scottie youre next Go ahead its

okay

Alex passes the box and scooper to Scottie

SCOTTIE

What should I say

ALEXANDRA

Just say goodbye

Scottie looks at Alex and scoops out a pile holds them at

eye-level and pauses

MATT

Come on Scottie Its okay

SCOTTIE

(finally)

Bye Mom

A sad Scottie pours her scoop into the water All look
down

as the ashes descend

113A

The Descendants PINK Shooting Draft 41110 Draft

MATT
All right Scottie here Pass that to

me Good job

Now Matt takes his turn He looks directly inside the urn at

the ashes that were once his wife

ANGLE ON THE ASHES -- HIS POV

A complex series of emotions passes over his face -- love

grief disappointment resignation

Without further ceremony he upends the BOX over the water and

pours the rest of Elizabeth into the ocean

All three take a long look as the mass of ashes disappears
Matt takes off his LEI and places it into the water The

girls follow suit

WIDE ANGLE of the boat floating as the leis float away

INT KING HOUSE - NIGHT

Scottie lies on a sofa watching television draped with the
QUILT that lay atop her mothers hospital bed Matt comes
over with TWO DISHES hands one to her

MATT
One scoop strawberry one scoop mocha
chip
SCOTTIE
Great

Matt gets under the quilt with her Moments later Alexandra
wanders in notices what theyre watching sits next to Matt
pulls the quilt over her legs

ALEXANDRA
Can I have some

His eyes not leaving the TV Matt hands Alex his ice cream
As they sit there on the sofa the CREDITS roll quietly over
them

THE END
