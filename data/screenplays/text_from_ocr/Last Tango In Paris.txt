FINAL SHOOTING
TRANSCRIPT

FADE IN

EXT PARIS FRANCE - PONT DE BIR-HAKEIM - DAY
PAUL (50s) stands on the street under a RAISED TRAIN
BRIDGE
He covers his ears in UTTER DISGUST at the UNBEARABLE NOISE
a
train makes as it ROARS OVERHEAD
He BELLOWS TO THE HEAVENS
PAUL
(ENGLISH)
FUCKING GOD
As the train moves on he walks slowly DESPONDENT Lost in
private WORLD OF PAIN

Behind him we see a woman in a fur collard coat and flowered
hat walking gaining on him This is JEANNE (20s)

As she PASSES Paul she turns to GLANCE at him We read a
HINT of EMPATHY on her face

He is OBLIVIOUS to her or anything else for that matter

She walks on dodging STREET SWEEPERS as she covers the long
walkway trying to forget the SAD MAN she saw

We see her walk toward a 6 story APARTMENT BUILDING
as

frame

her

cheeks

Paul with TEARS STREAMING DOWN HIS FACE comes to reality
he also notices the building He REGARDS it

CUT TO
EXT APT BUILDING - PASSEY - DAY

Jeanne stands looking at the grandeur of the building at 1
RUE JULES VERNE She reads a FOR RENT sign on the door

She HESITATES but then RINGS THE BELL She checks her watch
She SMILES to herself then descends the nearby stairs
She goes into a BAR

DIALOGUE IS IN FRENCH

JEANNE
A phone token please

BARTENDER

JEANNE
Thank you

Jeanne goes to the TELEPHONEWASHROOM
The telephone booth is OCCUPIED

As she waits she watches in disgust as an OLD LADY cleans
her DENTURES with a toothbrush and then puts them back in

mouth
Jeanne STUDIES her own face in the MIRROR puffing her

up in judgement As she does Paul exits the phone booth
still LOST IN ANGUISH

After watching him leave Jeanne USES THE PAY PHONE She
speaks to her MOM

One of the APT GUESTS puts an empty WINE BOTTLE outside
their door They both TAKE NOTICE

concierge TRILLS OUT FIGARO she gives up and walks away

CONCIERGE (CONTD)
Wait Dont go There must be a
duplicate

She looks for it

CONCIERGE (CONTD)
Here it is

Jeanne against her better judgement goes back to the desk
She holds out her hand The Concierge puts the KEY IN HER
HAND

LAUGHING CRAZY HYSTERICAL Jeanne has to forcefully break
away from her grasp

hand

My mother was very Very poetic

memories when I was a kid was of
her being arrested nude We lived
in this small town Farming
community We lived on a farm

And Id come home after school and
shed be gone In jail or
something And I used to I
used to have to milk a cow every
morning and every night and I liked
that I remember

One time I was all dressed up to go
out and take this girl to a
basketball game And started to
go out and my father said You
have to milk the cow I said
Would you please milk it for me
And he said No get your ass out
there So I went out and I was in
a hurry and didnt have time to
change my shoes And had cow shit
all over my shoes And on the way
to the basketball game it smelled
in the car I dont know I-I cant
remember very many good things

JEANNES VOICE
Not one

PAUL
Yeah Some There was a farmer a
very nice guy Old guy very poor
and worked real hard I used to
work in a ditch draining land for
farming And he wore overalls and
he smoked a clay pipe Half the
time he wouldnt put tobacco in it
And I hated the work It was hot
and dirty and it broke my back
And all day long Id watch his
spit which would run down the pipe
stem and hang on the bowl of the
pipe And I used to make bets with
myself on when it was going to fall
off And I always lost I never saw
it fall off Id just look around
and itd be gone and then the new
one would be there And then we had
a beautiful My mother My
mother taught me to love nature
And I guess that was the most
she could do And we had In
front of our house we had this big
field meadow It was a mustard
field in the summer and we had a
big black dog named Dutchy And she
used to hunt for rabbits in that
field but she couldnt see them So
shed have to leap up in this
mustard field and look around very
quickly to see where the rabbits
were And it was very beautiful
And she never caught the rabbits

Pop Thats the formula For pop
youth pop marriage But what if

the pop marriage doesnt work

workers in overalls bending over an
engine to fix it

happens to the pop marriage

JEANNE
In that case there are three or
four workers

TOM
