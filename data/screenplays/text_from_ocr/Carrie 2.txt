TI wish that I could write you a melody so plain
That would save you dear lady from going insane
Bob Dylan Tombstone Blues

BLACK

MUSIC UP Slow sad ethereal
Perhaps even eerie

FADE IN

On a sea of red filling the frame A crimson ocean without
waves or ripples

A thick housepainters BRUSH dips in revealing its paint
The BRUSH is extracted paint dripping like congealing

FOLLOW THE BRUSH to reveal
INT A HOUSE - NIGHT

A white wall where the BRUSH is moved horizontally leaving
a thick continuous stripe until the paint thins out

A WOMANS HAND plunges the BRUSH back into the paint can
then takes up creating the stripe again painting the wall
until it reaches andpleated drape --

-- and doesnt stop A window and another drape receive the
same treatment before the BRUSH is re-dipped

A PUPPY
a sad-eyed basset hound sits on the floor watching a bit
parallel

worn

drip

perplexed This is WALTER and even he knows this is weird
The dog looks over to

A FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL
standing next to him also watching This is RACHEL Dark

haired in a plain dress Her large eyes are welling on the
verge of tears

The BRUSH is dragged across the wall hits a wooden picture
frame moves across a cheap oil painting of a pastoral
forest scene and over the other edge of the frame

Another ANGLE takes in the red line five feet high

to the floor extending around a modest living room
Painting the line is BARBARA LANG in her thirties yet

haggard- She hasnt slept in a while

The precision of her work her concentration her focus as
the line runs across a wall and into a corner is more than

little frightening

RACHEL

Mommy
BARBARA hears nothing says nothing just wipes a paint
This is a very careful line

RACHEL
Momma come play with me In my room
But her mother keeps painting across a door

RACHEL
Right now mommy okay
BARBARA looks at her or rather through her And continues
her task RACHEL steps forward tugs on her moms

RACHEL
I got a idea we could--
into

-- and gets splat right-in the face with the brush

THE KITCHEN
A TOY AMBULANCE sits on the floor RACHELs tiny hand
deliberately presses a button on it The TOY responds with

wheep whe ep siren then
AMBULANCE VOICE

(CANNED TINNY)
If you need help dial nine one one
If you need help dial nine one one

A WALL-MOUNTED PHONE
RACHELs HAND struggles to reach the buttons to dial 9-1-1
BARBARAs still painting the wall in the background

RACHEL (0S)

EXT THE STREET - FROM ABOVE - NIGHT

A light rain falls on an AMBULANCE sitting next to a POLICE
Its dashing red lights

CRUISER with its doors flung open

splash over the umbrella carrying NEIGHBORS in pajamas and
robes watching

TWO EMS WORKERS drag a struggling BARBARA across a lawn
her hands in plastic restraining cuffs

A wet RACHEL stands by a kneeling POLICE OFFICER holding a
poncho over her head

POLICEMAN
Rachel Rachel are you okay
She keeps staring off watching her mother being stuffed

the ambulance

RACHEL
Momma
She starts towards her but the OFFICER holds her back

POLICEMAN

to get some rest so shell feel

As the AMBULANCE pulls away RACHEL catches a glimpse of her
mother in the rear windows watching her

POLICEMAN

The POLICEMAN collects himself

POLICEMAN

RACHEL
She breaks free races into

INT THE HOUSE - NIGHT

Where she runs down the entrance hall Behind her outside
as the POLICEMAN runs toward the front door it --

SLAMS by itself right in his face

FOLLOW RACHEL as she rushes through the living room and down
a hall Another door slams shut behind her

HER ROOM
She spins frightened by the door that closed behind her To
her left
A WINDOW crashes shut startling her Then like a wave
moving in a circle around her another WINDOW bangs down a
DOOR slams shut another WINDOW Scared RACHEL backs into

A CLOSET
where she finds WALTER huddling and cradles him in her arms
The CLOSET DOOR swings shut sealing her off from the world

FROM ABOVE
In the dark RACHEL is in a fetal position on the floor dry
eyed in shock curled around her puppy
Theres the far-off sound of POUNDING on a door

DISSOLVE TO

NT A DARKENED BEDROOM - DAWN

RACHEL now 17 is curled in bed around WALTER also now a
far more senior dog Shes enmeshed in tangled white

Small TATTOOS come into view -- A delicate angel with broken
wings on her ankle A small EGYPTIAN ANKH is etched on her
shoulder blade

Wrapped around her upper arm is an elegant THORN BAND
encircling a HEART either protecting or imprisoning it
Theres a knock on her bedroom door

lips framed by raven black hair

MARK

BEHIND RACHEL --
THE TV SET -- keeps playing football highlights but

FLASH of TWO INTERTWINED BODIES

RACHEL holds the NOTEBOOK unsure of what to do with it The

dancing

MARK
Open it Go head read off the
scores

BRAD

Start with Eric

expression She sees the Bulldog names across the top of the
page with lists of girls beneath each one Every girl has a
number next to her with a total at the bottom

MARK

it

MONICA

looks around hasnt seen whats going on yet ERIC
intercepts him turning JESSE away from the TV

ERIC
Hey man what did the scout say
Behind Rte
THE TV SET -- between shots of players grunting tackling
and smashing into each other longer and longer segments
appear of

A COUPLE MAKING LOVE --

from the waist up with thick scan lines that almost make it
look surreal Its obvious that the girl is RACHEL and the
boy is JESSE

DANCING KIDS notice whats on the TV and start to point and
laugh at the set RACHEL is completely unaware of whats
going on behind her

MARK
See we didnt think Jess could do i
so he offered to get evidence proof

MONICA
Here comes Jesses big play

MARK
Lookie lookie Rachel
RACHEL realizes people are watching something behind her
then laughing at her She turns and sees
The IMAGES of her and JESSE on the TV
Her face goes slack with horror

RACHEL
Oh God
MARK leans in to RACHEL who hasnt noticed JESSE

MARK
Jess was disappointed with the picture

than Pam and Tommy Lees tape
CK

MARK
Why dont we ask Jesse
He turns and calls out

MARK (CONTD)

stares back horrified Then he sees the TV set behind her

JESSE

arms
and pull him back into the crowd

She tries to get away but BRAD pushes her into MONICA who
shoves her to AMY as they join in the chanting

Rachel

MONICA

Rachel

Drowning out JESSEs cries

RACHELs PQV -- spinning around A NIGHTMARISH GALLERY of
dancing jostling torsos TWISTED FACES and LAUGHING MOUTHS
smirking and pointing at her

INTERCUT WITH

FAST CLOSE-UPS
of RACHEL and JESSE making love The assault of music
chanting and images crescendo with
BRAD grabbing RACHELs bare arm below her HEART-THORN TATTOO
forcing her to face the TV screen

BRAD
Hey is that a zit on your ass
RACHEL has tears streaming down her face for the first time
since she was four years old
She bows her head

A LAUGHING BRAD

glances down at RACHELs arm

The THORN VINE around the HEART TATTOO looks bigger edging
up her arm

He looks away shares a laugh with MARK looks back and

THE HEART TATTOO
on RACHELs upper arm is growing etched from within the
thorn covered vine snaking like a tendril up her arm

BRAD
Holy shit
He releases her
RACHEL raises her head eyes glowing with pain and rage her
broken heart turned to stone
The delicate THORN VINE has grown across her chin cheekbone
and forehead swirling around to end on her other cheek
A stunned BRAD backs away from her
JESSE breaks free of ERICs grip slugs CHUCK and pushes his
way towards RACHEL
Her HEART POUNDS at an alarming rate as she slowly turns and
sees JESSE coming at her his arms out to take her in his
spider-

embrace

A KNIFE
on the bar dances and rattles then
A WHIP PAN finds
JESSE as his back arches in pain and he screams The KNIFE
embedded in his open palm nailing his hand to the wall
MARK and the other boys stare in shock

MARK
What the fuck
ON JESSE -- as he screams again
A CORKSCREW has pierced his other hand at waist level The
SCREW spins around burrowing into his flesh

Everyone on that side of the room stops dead taking in the
bizarre sight

RACHEL straightens up and

The kitchen door CLOSES

The glass doors to the back yard slide SHUT

The front door SLAMS

TRACY

(LOOKING AROUND)
Whats going on Mark
I dunno
The floor starts to shake like a small earthquake All the
PARTYGOERS go still looking around at each other The room
is frozen even though the music keeps pounding
MARK looks at RACHEL her disheveled hair partially obscures
her features but her eyes are glowing

THE GLASS WINDOWS
surrounding the room begin to RATTLE then CRACK in a

web pattern Then
THE WINDOWS BURST inward
FOLLOW the deadly hail of shards as they cut through the

CROWD
FROM ABOVE -- The outer edge of the CROWD are mowed down as
if by a machine gun and
A WHIP PAN -- Finds a BOY impaled by a large jagged shard

TWISTED SHADOWS
are splayed across a wall of KIDS falling to the ground The
hard-edged music keeps playing while
CHUCKs decapitated head rolls across the floor and onto
A plate
The BEEFY BOY spins around clutcning at a shard protruding
from his neck his carotid artery spewing blood like a lawn
sprinkler

On a GIRL as his blood sprays across her face and

The BOY turns arcing blood across

The Jackson Pollock PAINTING which blends into the multi-

colored canvas

Reeling into the stereo the BOY scatters CDs everywhere

On RACHEL clothes spattered red tears streaming down her

cheeks

TRACY straightens up having been protected by MONICA whos

screaming her face a lacerated pulp with glass shards

sticking out of it like a pincushion

Surviving PARTYGOERS panic as they struggle to their feet
and

try to flee stampeding over each other

TRACY ERIC and BRAD shove their way through the crowd

EXT MARKS HOUSE - NIGHT

As SUE and BARBA k leap from the Volvo SUE hears the
screams from within the house takes in the shattered
windows

SUE BARBARA
Oh not Rachel
They race to the door as

WITHIN THE HOUSE

BRAD runs to the front door

An IRON FIREPLACE POKER lifts up one end then flies like a
javelin towards BRADs back as

DOOR - N
BARBARA and SUE approach the door when the end of the
bursts from the center of it nearly spearing a surprised
BARBARA in the face as it sticks out about a foot
She jerks back then pushes the door open with an effort

WITHIN THE HOUSE --

They enter and freeze as the door slams shut behind them
revealing a dead BRAD speared through the throat pinned to
the door

Oai my god Wheres Rachel

They see JESSE then RACHEL covered in tattoos

A panicked itMY smashes into BARBARA then runs toward a
window

RACHEL sees AMY and her eyes narrow

MUSIC CDs fly off a shelf and

Spin through the air at high velocity

One of the deadly frisbees buries itself in AMYs back
spinning her around More CDs embed in her stomach chest
and throat

MARK and ERIC smash their way through the chaos as MARKs
eyes flash from a collapsing AMY to RACHEL

MARK
God itls her Shes doing it
SUE moves towards RACHEL

SUE
Stop Stop it
RACHEL has her gaze locked on
MARK who realizes hes a dead man He moves toward a
shattered window through which some PEOPLE escape
But RACHEL turns her head slightly and
A TELEKINETIC PULSE travels across the row of LIQUOR BOTTLES
at the bar exploding them one-by-one spraying alcohol

which

douses SUE
A FLAMING LOG erupts from the fireplace
Striking the alcohol-drenched BAR setting a blazing trail
and lighting the curtains on fire creating a wall of FLAMES
before the windows

SUE
Stop it You dont want to--
And RACHEL snaps her head around launching another LOG

from
the fireplace which strikes SUE in the back whose alcohol
drenched clothes catch flames and she A

A screaming SUE pitches forward rolls on the floor to put
out the flames but caly succeeds in lighting another trail
of liquor which creates a barrier to the backyard windows
In the eye of the storm is BARBARA shaking her head in
denial muttering as her mental state rapidly deteriorates

BARBARA
No this isnt happening It isnt
happening isnt happening
MARK pulls ERIC by the shirt collar and they careen down

A HALLWAY
where each of the DOORS ahead of them SLAM SHUT as they
approach
Utter CHAOS but RACHEL calmly turns into the hallway
following MARK as if in a trance

I

MARK
lowers his shoulder crashes through a closing door into

A DEN
where the walls are decorated with deer heads and hunting
trophies MARK and ERIC are smashing a standing glass case
containing pistols and rifles
TRACY leans panting against the wall
MARK slips a HANDGUN into his belt

TRACY
Screw that get the shotguns
Shaking freaked out they gather weapons

THE HALL
d ERIC see RACHEL the end of the hall silhouetted
from behind They take off in the other direction TRACY
bringing up the re
Barrelling shoulders first into a door the boys burst

at

through and into

EXTa€¢ THE BACK YARD - NIGHT

Where they almost stumble into the swimming pool

Toting their rifles MARK ERIC and TRACY turn to find
RACHEL at a gunfighters distance coming towards them
TRACY and BRAD cock their weapons and bring them to their
shoulders TRACY slips on her glasses

MARK
Wait till shes closer
TRACY tightens her finger on the trigger
RACHELs eyes narrow and
TRACYs glasses shatter into her eyes spewing blood
milky fluid
Aaaaa
She staggers fires her shotgun into ERICs groin and he
lands sitting next to the pool A dying ERIC stares at his
shredded lap then falls over
MARK looks at his dead friend
Oh shit
recovers and swings his aim back at RACHEL But his
rifle goes sailing over his head and into the grass twenty
feet behind him
He makes eye-contact with a grim RACHEL advancing toward

and hauls ass
RACHEL glances at a coiled GARDEN HOSE and it springs to
life slithering through the grass and across the concrete

high speed to wrap around MARKs ankle and trip him up
He hits the ground hard and rolls over to find the hose
twisting around his legs and up his waist like a python

HIS HAND
grasps for the rifle but falls short as the hose pins his
other arm to his side then curls around his windpipe ina
stranglehold
the

His eyes widen as the life is squeezed from him and he sees
RACHEL standing over him

He gropes for the shotgun again and finally grabs it
RACHEL looks at the rifle and it flies from his hold
splashing into the pool

But she jolts on two

GUNSHOTS

RACHEL looks down MARK had pulled the handgun from his belt
with his pinned hand and fired

Shes holding her belly gutshot staggers and falls into

pool disappearing amid a swirl of blood

MARK yanks the hose from his neck as it goes slack He
gasps points the gun into the pool and FIRES until its
silent and hes left pulling the trigger on empty chambers
He gets his breatking under control leans over to look into
the water of the deep end He Aar on the sound of a
mechanical whirring and turns

A POOL COVER starts to unfold

At that moment

RACHELS BLOODY ARM
bursts from the water and grips his neck MARK grabs her
forearm as her other arm yanks him into the pool

UNDERWATER --
As RACHEL drags MARK down he kicks and pummels her but she
holds on The POOL COVER steadily closes over them shutting
out the light from above
MARK finally frees himself and lunges for the surface but
the POOL COVER blocks his escape
He desperately pushes at it eyes bulging lungs burning as
his feet kick to keep him afloat

ON THE SURFACE --

The POOL COYER closing as RACHEI hauls herself from the
water barely making it out MARKS HAND grabs her leg
slides then clutches at the edge of the pool His fingers
slip under as the cover completely shuts

M RXs head bulges the POOL COVER then his hands punch
feebly at it a few times Then nothing

BARBARA (0S)

Rachel

A weakened RACHEL lays by the pool She seems to be snapping
out of her trance as she rolls over and sees BARBARA

RACHEL shudders and suddenly just looks like a wet scared
little girl reaching for her mother

RACHEL
Mama Maury
BARBARAS POV o
but its a FOUR-YEAR-OLD RACHEL pristine without tattoos
BARBARA blinks and her POV is of a TEN-YEAR-OLD RACHEL
reaching for her
Mama please
BARBARA blinks and its now
The 17-YEAR-OLD RACHEL covered in blood and tattoos
She looks her daughter in the eyes backs away in terror

BARBARA
What are you Youre not my little
girl No The devils in you

RACHEL

(CRYING)
Dont leave me mama
But her mother disappears into the shadows

RACHEL
Please I dont have anyone
She rolls onto her back looks up at the STARRY NIGHT

RACHEL
Please God let me die
And she tightly shuts her eyes

DISSOLVE BACK TO
while

THE LIVING ROOM

A vision of hell -- crimson-stained walls and piled bodies
The fire is spreading licking its way across the burning
SCOREBOARD NOTEBOOK and along the floor toward

JESSE in pain still pinned to the wall He raises his head
and starts in fear as

o the center of the room facing him

He sees the gunshot wounds in her stomach then follows her
gaze to

THE TV SET
with a cracked screen but still playing the tape of their
intimate moment at the cabin with a sleeping RACHEL laying

ON JESS
He looks back at her

JESSE
Rachel listen I swear d
know they were taping us d
never hurt you
She looks at his pleading eyes

JESSE

ON TV -- the moment of JESSE saying I love you to her

turns back to JESSE amazed

A BLAZING CHUNK of ceiling falls near her

JESSE

Rachel Gat out now Go
And the KNIFE and the CORKSCREW drop away releasing him
He falls to the floor drags himself over and takes

in his arms He cradles her She whispers and he bends over
to hear She whispers again

RACHEL
-love you
JESSE tenderly kisses her lips
And all the TATTOOS fade from her face and body
Love
Her face is serene
JESSE traces his fingers across her brow embraces her the
flames start to encircle them just like in RACHELs
nightmare
JESSE pulls RACHEL over the debris ridden floor toward the
back windows but stumbles and goes down Her eyes flutter
open

RACHEL
Leave Get out
Instead of leaving her JESSE hugs RACHEL closer The sleeve
of his jacket catches flames And he accepts his fate
RACHEL shuts her eyes gives one last TELEKINETIC PUSH

EXT THE BACKYARD - NIGHT

And a BODY is flung out the back window like a rag doll
clothes in flames

The BODY goes fifteen feet and falls onto the pool cover

weight bowing the cover enough for water to rush over it

and a notebook An all-night study session

His hair is shor hes wearing a beard His face is more
mature sadder The beard largely hides some burn scars on
one side of his face

Over the desk is a MIRROR and a Fighting Irish pennant
The only light comes from his desk lamp

He jerks awake with a spasm glances at a digital clock
glowing on his desk 11S AM

The sad-eyed DOG whimpersand JESSE scratches him
In the distance the CLOCK TOWER BELL can be heard CHIMING

As JESSE looks down and his eyes widen in surprise
Somehow hes scrawled on the notebook paper on the desk in
front of him
Ng of HELL
Or if you only look at the capitalized letters it reads
Around it the same phrase is written over and over again
Ng of HELL kINg of HELL kINg of HELL
