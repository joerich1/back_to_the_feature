INT STAIRWELL - DAY
White gloves on small brown hands
Black patent leather shoes on spirited feet

The morning sun streams in through a nearby stained glass
window reflecting rays of gold and topaz and magenta as
SEVEN KIDS make their way down a church staircase

Five girls Two boys All with small learning bibles in hand

BOY 1
I hear it’s just like a swimming
pool They dip you in and say the
prayer and then you done

GIRL 1
I don’t know I practice holding my
breath but I’m scared to have my
head under water What if I need to
breathe

GIRL 2
I promise you it ain’t nothing to
be scared of It’s quick And
Pastor right there next to you

GIRL 3
The biggest thing is getting your
hair wet up I got it pressed that
same morning and it was wasted soon
as I hit that water I should’ve
worn a swim cap like Mama said

BOY 2
A swim cap So you can look like
you got ringworms

All the girls burst into sweet laughter

GIRL 3
A swim cap not a ringworm cap

BoY 1
(shrugs )
Same difference

GIRL 4
Nuh-uh You ain’t never seen Esther
Williams

The boys give up and head in another direction at the
landing The girls giggle and continue down the stairs
GIRL 5
I asked my Mama can she make my
hair like Coretta Scott King had
hers fixed at the Washington March
But she said it’s too grown

GIRL 4
Oh I love her hair

In unison they all agree as they reach the lower landing

GIRL 3
(stopping on the last
stair for emphasis)
I heard she don’t even put rollers
in it It’s just like that But I
studied it I know how to do it

At this the other girls turn around to hear the valuable
tutorial

GIRL 3 (CONTD)
See she just parts it in the
middle and then she

Interrupted without warning they all hear something strange
and turn in the direction of a LOUD CRACKING Their
expressions questioning the origin of the unfamiliar sound

The answer DETONATES in the next room

The camera SLOWS to follow the girls Lifted off their feet
as BRICKS fly through the air Striking them

Windows shatter raining LARGE SHARP SHARDS One slicing
clean through a petite limb

Gloves now gray with soot raised in defense of a SPLINTERED
WOOD BEAM that crashes down from above

The back of a head adorned with curls smashes against a
CONCRETE WALL

The CRIPPLED CEILING buckles then collapses amidst the DARK
SMOKE

Then -- all is silent except for a HIGH-PITCHED HISS which
increases in intensity

We pull back on the room to find FOUR LITTLE GIRLS laying
motionless Among blood and debris and bibles

Covered in TINY BITS OF GLASS that gleam in that morning sun
against their broken bodies
INT GRAND HOTEL PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - OSLO NORWAY

We look directly into the eyes of DR MARTIN LUTHER KING UR
And he is looking directly at us

He is deeply disturbed He shakes his head Disappointed

KING
No

A long sigh as we pull back to reveal his gaze resting upon
his own image He wrestles with his tie in a long mirror

KING (CONTD)
This isn’t right

We now see that he’s dressed in formal striped pants and a
gray tuxedo with tails

KING (CONTD)
Corrie This ain’t right

CORETTA (0S)
What’s that

KING
This necktie It’s not right

CORETTA SCOTT KING enters from the dressing room in all her
elegance and efficiency

CORETTA
It’s not a necktie dear It’s an
ascot

KING

(still struggling)
Yes but generally the same
principles should apply shouldnt
they This isn’t right

CORETTA
Isn’t right Or you don’t like it

She crosses to him and waits for him to give up Then gently
pulls the tie from the irregular knot and begins again

KING
I don’t like how this looks

CORETTA
Looks distinguished and debonair to
me
KING
You know what I mean Like we’re
here living high on the hog
Dressed like this While folks at
home are it’s not right
(a brooding beat)

Wait ‘til the brothers back home
see me like this They’ll have a
good laugh

CORETTA
(clearly her sore spot)
Let ‘em laugh It’s not a crime to
be away for a few days Martin

Their faces are close She’s focused on the tie He’s focused
on her now Lightening up

KING
It’s nice being away huh

CORETTA
Yeah It really is

A beat as she works

KING
Look I’m gonna go be a pastor
somewhere small A college town
Led a little church teach a class
The occasional speaking engagement

CORETTA
I’1l make out all the bills for us
especially the mortgage for our
very own house Savings since we
don’t have a phone anymore and all

KING
Our own phone-less house Perfect

They smile at that little game as she finishes the fancy tie
They remain close

KING (CONT’D)
Ever wish we could go back Before

CORETTA
I don’t think we would if we could
(a sad beat)
You look handsome

She turns around to the mirror and pats her hair in place as
they each look upon the other’s reflection
INT OSLO UNIVERSITY - LATER

APPLAUSE from dignitaries as King makes his way to an ornate
polished podium He joins GUNNAR JAHN the elderly Nobel
Committee Chairman who holds an encased medal with pride

JAHN
I have the great honor to stand
with the youngest recipient in our
history a man of 35 years old We
honor this man from the Deep South
of the United States of America
who has been imprisoned on many
occasions whose home has been
subject to bomb attacks whose life
and the lives of his family are
constantly under fatal threat and
who nevertheless does not falter in
his quest for justice and for
freedom Martin Luther King has
spoken of his dream One which we
and many people across the world
share To this undaunted champion
of peace the Nobel Committee of
the Norwegian Parliament awards the
Peace Prize for 1964 For you sir

Visibly moved King accepts and steps to the microphone

KING
Your Royal Highness Mr President
Excellencies I refuse to accept
that mankind is so bound to the
starless midnight of racism that
the bright daybreak of brotherhood
can never be a reality

We watch a great orator in full command of the room

KING (CONTD)
I accept this honor for our lost
ones I accept this honor for 22
million American Negroes who move
with determination and a majestic
scorn for risk and danger I
believe that what the self-centered
have torn down the other-centered
can build up I believe that We
Shall Overcome

APPLAUSE Then letter by letter as it is typed ON SCREEN

INT SMALL-TOWN COURTHOUSE LOBBY - DAY

The APPLAUSE CONTINUES as we watch ANNIE LEE COOPER a plump
dignified woman in her fifties completes a form with
meticulous handwriting She smiles with satisfaction as if
this document was a mountain conquered

She carefully gathers her coat and purse pats her hair and
straightens her hat takes a deep breath and walks across the
polished lobby of the small quiet courthouse

She heads to the REGISTRAR a 30ish white male reading the
comics at a window marked “SELMA ADMINISTRATION OFFICE”

Annie Lee stands there for several seconds but the man
ignores her He continues to read never looking up Then

ANNIE LEE COOPER
‘Scuse me sir I come to register

REGISTRAR
Aint nobody called you up here
Sit on down ‘til you’re called

ANNIE LEE COOPER
But there’s no one here

REGISTRAR
You stirrin’ trouble Sit your
black behind down ‘til ya called
Or I‘’ll ring up the Sheriff

Annie Lee swallows her pride and turns around She walks back
across the lobby gripping her purse tight to calm herself
As soon as she reaches the seat and sits down

REGISTRAR (CONT’D)
Annie Lee Cooper

She looks at him He smirks at her

REGISTRAR (CONTD)
Get on up now I ain’t got all day

She grits her teeth and rises She holds her head high as she
walks back across the lobby placing the form on the counter

REGISTRAR (CONTD)
You work for Mr Dunn at the rest
home ain’t that right

ANNIE LEE COOPER
(hesitantly)
Yessir
REGISTRAR
Wonder what ol’ Dunn’1l say when I
tell him one of his gals over here
stirrin’ trouble

ANNIE LEE COOPER
Aint stirrin’ trouble I’m here to
vote

He snatches the form and reviews it with pen in hand After a
while he becomes annoyed that there is nothing to correct

ANNIE LEE COOPER (CONT’D)
It’s all right this time

Their eyes meet

REGISTRAR
It’s right if I say its right

She doesn’t waver Her eyes are trained on him

REGISTRAR (CONTD)
Recite the Constitution’s preamble
Know what a preamble is

She swallows hard and then

ANNIE LEE COOPER
We the people of the United States
in order to form a more perfect
union establish justice ensure
domestic tranquility provide for
the common defense promote the
general welfare and secure the
blessings of liberty to ourselves
and our posterity

REGISTRAR
How many county judges in Alabama

ANNIE LEE COOPER
Sixty-seven

Silence

REGISTRAR
Name them

Annie stares at him He inks a rubber stamp He looks down at
a form Bang DENIED

Close on Annie Head still high Her face doesn’t change but
her eyes We see a light go out She turns and walks away
EXT WASHINGTON DC - DAY

KING walks across the Mall at a brisk pace with two advisors
on each side ANDREW YOUNG balancing an air of both warmth
and sophistication And CT VIVIAN a taller slender man with
a determined expression

YOUNG
Johnson’s indicated that his main
focus will be to get your buy-in on
his Poverty program Be prepared
youll have to work around that to
get to what you’re there for He
won’t see Selma coming

King nods in understanding

YOUNG (CONTD)
Also I highly recommend you take
this face-to-face opportunity to
discuss Hoover The surveillance

Vivian meets Young’s eyes This is important Will he do it

KING
Andy I don’t want to open that
can my friend

YOUNG
It’s open Marty It’s already
open Just a matter of when and how
they want to spill it all out

King is clearly affected by these words but masks his worry

VIVIAN
Were being very careful on the
phone and in public rooms now

YOUNG
Key word being “now”

KING
I’m focusing on the task at hand
brothers That’s all my head will
hold right now My hope is that the
new international attention’1l move
the needle without us having to
engage at the ground-level in Selma
or anywhere else Maybe we won’t
need to go full-scale

The subject has officially been changed But not before Young
and Vivian share a look of deep concern as the trio walks
quickly toward the White House in the distance

INT WHITE HOUSE - DAY

PRESIDENT LYNDON B JOHNSON all six feet four inches of him
barrels towards the Oval Office with his top aide LEE WHITE

JOHNSON
Aren’t we done yet Are we not done
with this Will it ever end

WHITE
Apparently not Mr President

JOHNSON
What’s he want What’s he gonna ask
for now Huh I know He’s gonna
ask for more enforcement on the
Civil Rights Act That’s it Yep
Fuck What can we give him

WHITE
A very extensive plan is already in
place sir Id say just reiterate

JOHNSON
Man’s not coming for reiteration
Man’s looking for something so he
can say “Look I told you I hada
dream and now it’s all coming
fucking true - whether you like it
or gotdamn not” That’s what he
wants But what he needs to do is
get on board with what we’re doing
Not the other way around For once

He strides into the Oval Office from the residential entry to
find his secretary

SECRETARY
Mr President Dr King is

JOHNSON
Yes yes Bring him on in

White takes a seat while Johnson straightens his tie and has
a sip of water Preparing

King enters The men shake hands with faux warmth Then
Johnson places a long arm around King’s shoulder

JOHNSON (CONTD)
Martin I have to tell ya I may be
a tall sonofabitch but this close
to the new Nobel laureate I feel
tits-high to a puppy dog

KING
(laughing)
Well thank you Mr President

Talking all the while Johnson guides King to a chair by a
small table set with coffee Johnson pours

JOHNSON
I have to tell you Martin ending
segregation with the ‘64 Act was my
proudest moment Civil rights is a
priority of this administration
You know that If we dont meet the
challenge this nations storing up
a heap of trouble for itself
Seeing as I can’t convince you to
come work with my administration in
an official capacity inside the
White House well I I just feel
damn fortunate having someone as
statesmanlike as you leading the
movement and I want you to go on
leading it No one else None of
those militant Malcolm X types So
I wanna help Tell me how

KING
Mr President I share your pride
in the Civil Rights Act and your
understanding that if these issues
are not addressed there will be
repercussions on our country’s
trajectory such as the unbridled
violence that continues to be
inflicted upon its Negro citizens
Including our children

At mention of the children Johnson bows his head in respect

KING (CONTD)
To that end Mr President I’m
here to speak specifically about
the denial of a basic American
right for the Negro citizen
(wait for it)
The right to vote

King smiles Johnson smiles - knowing King is goading him
JOHNSON
Well Martin technically

KING
- we already have it Yes Mr
President But we both know that in
the South black voters are kept
off the rolls and out of the voting
booth by fear and intimidation And
that - is a national disgrace

JOHNSON
It is It is Martin

KING
I’m so pleased you agree Mr
President You asked how you can
help We want Federal legislation
granting Negroes the right to vote -
unencumbered We want Federal
protocol to eliminate the decades-
long dismissal intimidation and
illegal denial of blacks seeking to
vote by local registrars who seek
to withhold this right And we
want robust enforcement of that
protocol

Johnson takes a moment to digest A little taken aback

JOHNSON
Well Martin That’s just fine but
most of the South is still not even
desegregatin First let’s
concentrate on getting the 64 act
up and runnin Folks are fatigued
Folks need an intermission We need
to heal some wounds first Dont
let’s start the next battle before
weve won the first

King is thoughtfully silent for a moment

JOHNSON (CONTD)
And you know what that next battle
should be The eradication of
poverty Poor people too busy
survivin’ to participate in the
democratic process Im putting
together the most ambitious program
of welfare reforms this country’s
ever seen Callin’ it “The War on
Poverty”

Johnson is on his feet returning from his desk with a bundle
of briefing papers in his hands He drops them on the table

JOHNSON (CONTD)
Its a simple matter of political
priorities The votin has to wait

King stares regretfully at Johnson for several seconds Is he
really going to have to go full-throttle on another cause

KING
It can’t Mr President

JOHNSON
Well Martin why not

KING
Because there’ve been thousands of
racially-motivated murders in the
South including those four little
girls and -

JOHNSON
I know that but -

KING
And you know the astounding fact
that not one of those criminals
who murder us when and why they
want has ever been convicted

JOHNSON
Martin I know we got a lot more
work to do down there -

KING

Not one conviction Because theyre
protected by white officials chosen
by an all-white electorate And on
the rare occasions they face trial
theyre freed by all-white juries
All-white because you cant serve
on a jury unless youre registered
to vote

Johnson has since taken a seat A bit less emboldened

KING (CONTD)
Mister President can you interpret
the full faith and credit clause
of Article IV section 1 of the US
Constitution also known as the
privileges and immunities clause

JOHNSON
What I’m lost here

KING
That’s a question on the Alabama
literacy test required for blacks
who attempt to register A Fisk
University alum named Bernard
Lafayette got it right God bless
him But he was flunked anyway
because he didn’t write the answer
in cursive which was the white
local registrar’s preferred style
of writing on that particular day

Brief silence Johnson looks into Kings eyes

JOHNSON
My administration has to be done
with this for a while Just for
awhile You can understand

KING
(a beat)
I understand Mr President

INT WHITE HOUSE SITTING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Young and Vivian look up expectantly as King enters with
concerned determination

KING
(firmly)
Selma it is

off Young and Vivian beyond satisfied

EXT US HIGHWAY - DAY

Dense woods on both sides of a four-lane interstate The kind
of southern forest where TALL TREES loom large and ominous
having borne the strange fruit of someone’s last breath

We find KING in the backseat of a blue Pontiac seated between
ANDREW YOUNG and another man RALPH ABERNATHY three years
older than King and the picture of Southern Baptist
distinction

The car is driven by a very large young man At 63 and
over 300 pounds JAMES ORANGE could easily be a linebacker

Next to him in the front passenger seat is DIANE NASH a
startlingly beautiful woman with a serious demeanor
The radio hums with THE SUPREMES singing “Come See About Me”
ORANGE

Big speech lined up for these
folks Doc

KING
We need to see what’s what first
Big Fella

YOUNG

Maybe Docll let you make the big
speech this time Ralphy

ABERNATHY
Thatll be the day

A highway sign proclaiming ‘SELMA 28 miles’ zips by

ABERNATHY (VO)

What you got us into woman We got
twenty-eight miles to come to our
senses gentlemen

NASH
Hush This here’s the place we
need to be This right here is the
next great battle
(off Orange’s nod)
They’1l see soon enough

off King Abernathy and Young in the rearview Not so sure

EXT EDMUND PETTUS BRIDGE - DAY

The car passes beneath a sign bearing a large Coca-Cola logo
stating SELMA ALABAMA - Progressive and Friendly’ onto a
steel arched bridge into town Painted across an overhang
EDMUND PETTUS BRIDGE

YOUNG
What’d Mr Edmund Pettus do so well
they gave him a bridge in these
parts Orange

ORANGE
Um I’m not sure

ABERNATHY
I can only imagine Decent looking
place to die though

King looks up from some papers and nods matter-of-factly
along with Young as the small town comes into full view

EXTINT HOTEL ALBERT - DAY

A sign greets the group HOTEL ALBERT - Serving Whites Only
Since 1855’ KING and his crew pull up in front

A dashing man in a shirt tie and denim overalls approaches
the car at the curb JAMES BEVEL sticks his head through the
window He gives a nod to the men then a quick caress to
Nash’s cheek

BEVEL
Ms Nash

NASH
Mr Bevel

A loving smile between them The others look on smiling too

BEVEL
(back to business)

Doc we’ll get you checked in here
Then the local leaders’1l stop by
to conference with us But this is
it Selma’s the place A lot of
groundwork’s already been laid by
the people here They’re ready

King looks to his right at Abernathy To his left at Young

KING
Here we go

From inside the white Chief of Police WILSON BAKER stands in
the hotel lobby amidst an ALL-WHITE CROWD waiting to witness
the passing of an era

Baker spots another Serving Whites Only sign He thrusts it
at the bitterly resentful hotel staff

BAKER
Get rid of it Its illegal And in
about ten seconds itll also be a
lie

A sudden hush as BEVEL appears leading KING ABERNATHY
YOUNG NASH and ORANGE through the crowded lobby

King approaches the reception desk Abernathy and Young
appear tense Orange watchful Nash and Bevel radiate intense
satisfaction as King signs the silently proffered register

An earnest-looking younger white man approaches the group

EARNEST WHITE MAN
Dr King May I introduce myself

King looks at him and smiles

KING
Yes Of course

King steps towards him holding out his hand Orange senses
danger and moves forward Too late

The man SLAMS HIS FIST into King landing a punch to the head
and a kick in the groin as King goes down A well-dressed
white WOMAN smiles on her tiptoes for a better view

Orange is first in Pulling the man off King Baker and TWO
OFFICERS drag the attacker away while Young and Abernathy
form a protective barrier against further attack Nash has a
handkerchief to his forehead King is quickly on his feet

ORANGE
(mortified)
Doc Doc I’m sorry I I
KING

It’s okay I’m okay Big Fella

Abernathy fiercely proud of his friend’s courage snatches
the room keys off the counter and looks around defiantly

ABERNATHY
This way Doctor King
INT HOTEL ALBERT GUEST ROOM - LATER

KING sits on the bed with a cold compress ABERNATHY YOUNG
ORANGE NASH BEVEL and police chief WILSON BAKER are near

So are local leaders AMELIA BOYNTON a professional woman of
about 60 and FREDERICK REESE a thin preacher in his 30s

SUPERIMPOSE Hotel Albert Selma 414 pm King Abernathy

KING
I tell ya that white boy can hit

BAKER
You wanna file charges

KING
We prefer to remain focused

ORANGE
Chief who was that

BAKER
Part of the White Citizens Council

YOUNG
No better than the Klan

BAKER
Dont worry Theyre here too

The locals REESE and BOYNTON exchange a look They’re angry

REESE
Then why don’t you ban them from
congregating like you ban us Sure
was a lot of them in that lobby
Why isn’t Clark harassing them

BAKER
Reverend Reese you know darn well
that the courthouse is Sheriff
Clarks territory and the city is
mine Now I’ve done right by you
people But don’t push me

BOYNTON
Why’d you let him in the hotel

BAKER
Come again

BOYTON
Why would you allow a known white
supremacist to be in a place where
he could attack this man

King and his staff watch slightly wide-eyed as these small-
town leaders pepper their Police Chief with tough questions

BAKER
Mrs Boynton you know darn well
that every nut in America is here
And that is not my responsibility
(at King)
It’s his They’re here because he’s
here And vice-versa

BOYNTON
No Chief Baker No sir Dr King
is here because my late husband and
I wrote to him on behalf of the
Negro citizens of this community a
community that we helped build with
our backs and our bare hands And
we told him of our situation here
Of our organizing here We told him
of the disgraceful attitude of the
authorities in this town towards
the rights of its Negro citizens
And we called for him to come down
and help us That’s why he’s here

King smiles at these fiery locals impressed by them both

KING
See Chief Just obeying orders

BAKER
All I know is you folks booking
into this place for one night is a
calculated act of provocation

KING
A calculated act of desegregation
Part of our job That’s what we do

BAKER
What you do - is cause trouble

Baker turns away abruptly and goes King shakes his head

KING
Well Let’s not disappoint the man

The camera pulls back as everyone leans in Then letter by
letter as it is being TYPED

KING (CONTD)
And since we don’t fight Someone
might rightly get killed before its
over As good a place to die as any
I guess

CORETTA

KING

CORETTA
You and your friends can joke about

Segregation in Birmingham Now
Voting in Selma One struggle ends
just to go right to the next and

way it is a hard road But I don’t
think of it that way I think of
these efforts as one effort And
that one effort is for our life As
a community As a nation For our
lives We can do this We must do
this We see children become
victims of one of the most vicious
crimes ever perpetrated against
humanity within the walls of their
own church They are the martyred
heroines of a holy crusade for
human dignity

KING (CONTD)
And they have something to say to
each of us in their death They say
to us black and white alike that
we must do this We must substitute
caution with courage They say to
us that we must work unrelentingly
They say it is unacceptable that
more than 50 of Selma is Negro and
less than 2 of Negros here can
vote They say that the local white
leadership use their power to keep
us away from the ballot box and
keep us voiceless Those that have
gone before us say “no more” No
more That means protest that
means march that means disturb the
peace that means jail that means
risk And that is hard But we
cannot wait any longer

No sir Wait is over

ANNIE LEE COOPER the proud woman who attempted to register
earlier watches King with fierce approval

Behind her are WHITE REPORTERS taking notes

KING

So long as I do not firmly and
irrevocably have the right to vote
I do not possess myself I cannot
make up my own mind It is made up
for me I cannot live as a full
citizen I can only submit to the
will of others Others who do not
have my best interests at heart

(cries of Thats right)
We will not wait any longer Give
us the vote

MEETING
Give us the vote

Two young activists JAMES FORMAN and JOHN LEWIS listen too
KING

We’re not asking we’re demanding
Give us the vote

MEETING

SUPER Brown Chapel Selma 630pm - King and SCLC co-horts
incite approx 700 locals Several members of Student Non-
Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) present LOGGED

INT BROWN CHAPEL - MINUTES LATER

King makes his way through an ADORING CROWD to the church
basement when he’s approached by an assertive white reporter
ROY REED and a short white photographer SPIDER MARTIN

REED
Dr King Roy Reed of the New York
Times Are you truly non-violent if
youre provoking violence sir

KING
(to the photographer)
Hey Spider

SPIDER
(slapping hands)
Doc Good to see you again

KING

(to Reed)
We are here using our very bodies
in protest to say to those who
deny us that we will no longer let
them use their billy clubs in dark
corners and halls of power We make
them do it in the glaring light of
day The onus for their behavior
rests with them not us Thank you
for being here Mr Reed

King continues to the basement Exhausted but determined

INT BROWN CHAPEL MEETING ROOM - LATER

A strategy meeting in progress In addition to King and SCLC
staffers we’ve met the young men we saw in the audience are
present We soon learn that they are leaders from the student
group SNCC FORMAN is a firebrand Lewis more measured

BEVEL
Is SNCC standing with us on this or
not gentlemen

FORMAN
You want us to bring our people in
but you’re not giving nothing in
return Were asking for some kind
of commitment here

LEWIS
Respectfully weve been working on
voter registration in this town for
two years

WILLIAMS
You ain’t got very far have you

LEWIS
Maybe not But at least were still
here Reverend

WILLIAMS
Meaning what

FORMAN
This time next month you won’t be

BEVEL
Thats outrageous

FORMAN
Just like you left Albany Those
people are pathetic down there now
Like their Daddy left home

LEWIS
(appealing for calm)
Were trying to explain that

WILLIAMS
You know what I think we should
leave Selma now Leave it to these
two Come back in another two years
and see how much further ya got

KING
Thats enough Enough of this now
I havent the time for this None
of us got the time for this

The room is instantly silent King gets to his feet All look
in his direction with respect For Lewis with a bit of awe
KING (CONTD)
John James The way our
organization works is simple We
set up a confrontation - and wait
for our adversary to make a
mistake We were in Albany for nine
months But their sheriff Laurie
Pritchett never made a mistake
Kept his cool kept arresting us in
a humane way carried people to the
jail-wagons on stretchers Day in
day out There was no drama

FORMAN
(disparagingly)
You mean there was no cameras

KING

Exactly Now I know we all
understand that you young people
believe in working in the community
long-term Doing the good work to
raise black consciousness Going
door to door Educating people
about government and history Being
in the trenches for years if
neecessary It’s good grassroots
work I cant tell you how much I
admire that But what we do
primarily is raise white
consciousness In particular the
consciousness of whichever white
man happens to be sitting in the
Oval Office Kennedy ignored us in
Albany - because he could - because
the press and the TV ignored us
And right now Johnson has other
fish to fry and hell ignore us
too - if he can The only way to
stop him doing that is by being on
the front page of national press
every morning and on the TV news
every night And that requires
drama

(off their intense gaze)
Now John James answer me one
question Ive been told the
Sheriff in this town ain’t like
Laurie Pritchett in Albany Hes a
big ignorant bully like Bull Connor
in Birmingham You tell me You
know Selma You know Sheriff Jim
Clark Is he Laurie Pritchett Or
is he Bull Connor

Should they answer A moment between Lewis and Forman Then

LEWIS
He’s Bull Connor
KING
Good That’s good But it gets

better

EXT STREETS DAY

King Abernathy and Bevel lead MARCHERS through the streets
in the bitter Alabama cold Forman and Lewis are behind them

KING (VO)
Clark doesnt control the streets
like Connor did Clarks the
County Sheriff and all he controls
in Selma is the County Courthouse
So relatively speaking we have
clear avenues of approach to a
defined battle-zone In the
courthouse sits the heart of the
matter

From KINGS POV we pick out a building in the distance

KING (VO) (CONTD)
the voter registration office
Now this is an exceptional
circumstance In Albany there was
no clearly-defined battle-zone The
issue was segregation and
segregation was everywhere In
Selma we can concentrate all our
action on one building A citadel -

EXT COURTHOUSE DAY
CLOSE-UP on the single word NEVER on a lapel badge

KING (VO)
- defended by fanatics

We PULL BACK to see the badge is worn by a man impersonating
General Patton The large man wearing a white combat helmet
tight-fitting military-style uniform a six-shooter and
carrying a club is SHERIFF JIM CLARK - dressed for war Clark
stands atop the courthouse steps flanked by a line of
DEPUTIES with billy guns and clubs drawn

KING (VO) (CONTD)
Selma Courthouse A perfect stage

CLOSE-UP of Clark outrage and aggression as he eyes with
fierce hostility a group of journalists slowly walking in
single file reluctantly protected by city policemen

Across the street is a group of POSSEMEN A motley vigilante
crew bearing nothing more official than crudely made pin-
badges stating Sheriffs Posse’

They are even more heavily-armed than the deputies and carry
a strikingly varied assortment of side-arms home-made clubs
and electric cattle-prods

To jeers and abuse from RACIST ONLOOKERS King and the
Marchers line up at the foot of the courthouse steps

King looks up at Sheriff Clark who stares down at him from
the top stair

CLARK
You all deliberately causin’ an
obstruction If you dont disperse
youll be arrested I promise you

KING
Sheriff Clark were trying to gain
access to the registration office
Which is our legal right

From the other side of the street TWO YOUNG REDNECKS walk
across the road stop in front of Amelia Boynton spit on her
and march off Amelia takes out a handkerchief and wipes the
saliva from her coat

CLARK
Theres too many of you and you
know damn well there is Youre
going to have to wait at the rear

KING
No Sheriff Clark Were going in
the front and we’re waiting right
here Segregation is now illegal in
this country sir

Q

LOSE-UP of King the hard stare of a prize-fighter

Q

LOSE-UP of Clark his anger and frustration at a new pitch

Clark and King stare at each other for a long moment Then
Clark starts moving along a line of marchers outside the
courthouse to get to King jabbing people with his stick
elbowing and shoving them against the wall

The deputies move in on the marchers clubs raised hoping
for resistance but are confounded by an orderly process
VOLUNTEER ARRESTEES including Bevel Orange and Williams
sit on the ground with their hands over their heads

This upsets Clark even more and he continues to poke and
shove when he comes to old Cager daughter Viola and grandson
Jimmie who we saw in the church The tiny family is trying
to help elderly Cager sit down like the other demonstrators

CLARK
Keep the sidewalk clear Get over
there You Over against the wall

JIMMIE
Sheriff ain’t nowhere to go He’s
tryin’ to sit You askin’ him to
walk through walls He can’t do
that

CLARK
Then he better learn

Clark shoves Cager and he falls on Annie Lee Cooper who we
also saw in church She is smashed hard against the concrete

CLOSE on Annie angry But Clark doesnt register this
Hes now focused on Jimmie who has stepped between Clark and
Cager Clark pushes his stick into Jimmies chest
CLARK (CONT’D)
Well what we got here You got a
problem boy

Jimmie stares at Clark

CAGER
Son no He ain’t worth that

Clark jabs Jimmie

CLARK
So what you think boy

Clark sneers and gives another sharp prod

CLARK (CONTD)
Come on boy I’m worth it

Jimmie balls his fists at his sides and takes a step forward
Clark raises his club to strike Jimmie when - BANG

Clark is KNOCKED SIDEWAYS Annie Lee Cooper has gotten to her
feet and PUNCHED him The punch connects with surprising
force catching Clark under the eye and knocking him down
his helmet clattering loose onto the road

King the journalists the deputies and marchers alike all
watch in STUNNED SILENCE as Clark gets to his knees - and
Annie steps forward and WACKS HIM AGAIN Clark falls onto his
side and Annie moves in for another blow but two deputies
are behind her now They WRESTLE HER VIOLENTLY to the ground

Additional officers hold back King and his men

Sheriff Clark now on his feet stands over Annie who is
being held down Clark STRADDLES her swinging his billy club
up to strike her Then bringing it down with a LOUD CRACK on
Annies skull

The image FREEZES in a camera-flash from Spider’s camera
CLOSE-UP on King as horror and disgust turn to steely
resignation amidst flashbulbs PHOTOGRAPHERS surge toward
the awful scene This is drama And he asked for it

INT WHITE HOUSE - VARIOUS MORNING

President Johnson is eating breakfast alone An aide enters
carrying several newspapers

AIDE
Good morning Mr President

JOHNSON
Mornin’

The aide places the newspapers on the table and goes As he
eats Johnson stares at the New York Times

On the front page is the SENSATIONAL PHOTOGRAPH Clark
astride Annie holding his club in both hands and driving it
down onto her head as three deputies hold her down Johnson
groans

MONTAGE as Selma reports greet Johnson on VARIOUS MORNINGS

- He reads a headline of 200 senior citizens being arrested

- He watches a TV report showing Sheriff Clark punching CT
VIVIAN in the mouth as the preacher attempts to register

- Another newspaper headline with King railing against the
arrest of 300 juvenile marchers who were abused and arrested

— A TV report highlighting the fact that for the first time
ever esteemed teachers marched en masse We see them walk
with pride to cheers led by the local REV FREDERICK REESE

- Johnson watches HIMSELF on television from the day before
stating that the government will use the tools of the 1964
Civil Rights Acts to enforce voting and that no new
legislation is in play at this time

- The same report highlights Alabama Governor GEORGE WALLACE -
short intense stocky - railing against King as an “outside
agitator”

- A photograph showing ORANGE being whipped with a lash by
local whites as he tries to deliver water to the marchers in
line at the courthouse

— A TV report with Selma Mayor JIM SMITHERMEN at a press
conference referring to “Martin Luther Coon”

- A headline that BEVEL was hospitalized after being beaten
in jail and left naked near an open window overnight

Johnson slams the table in frustration and grabs the phone

MONTAGE ENDS

INT OVAL OFFICE - DAY

CLOSE-UP of an ageing J EDGAR HOOVER Hoover stands in front
of Johnson who sits behind his desk They are watched from
the sidelines by Lee White

JOHNSON
Whats the FBIs current info
regarding Martin Luther King

HOOVER
My information can be summed up in
a few words King is a political
and moral degenerate

JOHNSON
J Edgar you say that so thats
something I have to take seriously
Whether King writes love-letters to
Kruschev or whether hed like to
drop an atomic bomb on Moscow I
cant be sure

(MORE)

JOHNSON (CONTD)
And whether he has a woman in every
town or a man again I dont really
know But if Kings a degenerate
what I do know is - hes a non-
violent degenerate And I want him
to go on leading the civil rights
movement - not one of those blood
thirsty militants So what I need
to know right now is what’s he
about to do next

HOOVER
Weve picked up communication that
he’s going to be inciting an arrest
for himself within a few days by
refusing to stand in a single-file
line at the courthouse Get himself
some more press

JOHNSON
Well fuck me This circus just
keeps getting bigger and bigger
Bastard’s got every bleeding heart
callin’ telegramin’ writin’
He’s trying to back me into a
corner on this thing It’s
overshadowing everything else

HOOVER
Mr President you know we have
intel that shuts men with power
down permanently and unequivocally

The look that passes between them is heavy with irony We can
only wonder what Hoover has on Johnson

JOHNSON
(terse eye trained)
I’m very aware Mister Director

Hoover breaks the stare

HOOVER

If youd prefer a different
approach

(off Johnson’s interest)
We can go with the wife We know
there’s tension in the home
already We can weaken the dynamic
Dismantle the family

Off Johnson deep in thought

EXT SELMA JAIL - NIGHT

WIDE on heavy rain and strong wind battering trees and
shrubbery outside of the local jailhouse It is late and
slightly eerie as the camera draws closer and closer until we
come to an OPEN DOOR at the side of the building Oddly
open This is a jail afterall

INT SELMA JAIL WOMEN’S CELL - NIGHT

AMELIA BOYNTON sits in a large cell huddled with a group of
WOMEN MARCHERS shivering next to a door deliberately left
open to the cold night air

A FEMALE MARCHER deeply embarrassed close to tears
suddenly hitches up her skirt and squats down

FEMALE MARCHER
Im sorry Im so sorry

INT SELMA JAIL CELL MEN’S CELL - SAME TIME

From through the bars we hear the women weeping The men
are in pain too clustered together shoulder-to-shoulder

KING and ABERNATHY sit side-by-side on a bunk

ABERNATHY
Johnson’11 flinch

KING
Tired Ralphy Tiring of this

ABERNATHY
Eyes on the prize Marty

KING
What’s the prize

Looking out on the jailed men the old friends speak in
hushed tones

KING (CONT’D)
How does it help a black man to be
able to eat at a lunch counter if
he doesn’t earn enough to buy the
burger or can’t even read the menu
‘cause there was no Negro school
where he’s from Is that equality

ABERNATHY
Amen
KING
And what about equality in the
black psyche Look at these men
Beaten and broken down for
generations What happens when one
stands up says enough is enough

ABERNATHY
The leaders get struck down

KING
Look at Medgar Murdered the man in
his own driveway Kids and wife
right there inside the house

ABERNATHY
George and Hebert Lee Lamar Smith

KING
A man stands up only to be struck
down and what happens to the
people he led
(a beat)
What are we doing Ralphy

ABERNATHY
We take it piece by piece Like we
been doin’ We build the path as
we can Rock by rock

KING
(distracted)
This bunk is probably bugged
They’re going to ruin me - so they
can ruin this movement They are

ABERNATHY
Look at the birds of the air that
they do not sow nor reap nor
gather into barns and yet your
heavenly Father feeds them Are you
not worth much more than they And
who of you by being worried can add
a single hour to his life”

KING

(closes his eyes)

EXT BROWN CHAPEL - EVENING

We see BEVEL WILLIAMS and ORANGE from King’s SCLC and the
young LEWIS of SNCC huddle in conference outside of the
church Something is wrong Urgently wrong

BEVEL
Where’d you hear that

ORANGE
I overheard them talking about him
coming this evening

Orange is motioning to Lewis who is taken aback

LEWIS
Heard us I’m learning about this
just like you We didn’t do this

WILLIAMS

That Negro cannot be talking all
that “by any means necessary”
madness to these people They ‘bout
ready to bust as it is These
people pick up their guns and start
shooting white folk National
Guard’ll be here firing on us so
quick we wont realize it til they
lower us into the ground We gotta
plan goin For real progress

BEVEL
Well he’s on his way So we gotta
figure this out Right and fast

ORANGE
(looking beyond the men)
He ain’t on his way
(off their confusion)
Hes here

They all turn to find a tall fair-skinned black man
approaching He is flanked by an aide As the man comes
closer the faces of the movement leaders change

BEVEL
Holy shit

The man reaches them and takes off his hat
MAN

Evening brothers I’m looking for
Mr James Forman of SNCC

VOICE (0OS)
Malcolm welcome

To the leaders’ surprise JAMES FORMAN walks out of the
chapel and vigorously shakes hands with MALCOLM X The men
including Forman’s own comrade Lewis look on in disbelief

FORMAN
Gentlemen this is Malcolm X I
invited him to come speak to the
people

MALCOLM
(shaking all hands)
Actually El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz

FORMAN
Yessir Well we welcome you

As Forman takes MALCOLM X inside Williams turns to Lewis

WILLIAMS
What are you boys trying to do

LEWIS
(upset)
I didn’t know about this

WILLIAMS
What are you trying to pull Lewis

LEWIS
I didn’t know and I don’t like it

Bevel quiet until now sparks a little as an idea emerges

BEVEL
Orange go get Diane Ask her to
bring Coretta here

ORANGE
Mrs King Coretta That Coretta

BEVEL
She’s in town while Doc’s in jail
Well ask her to ask our Muslim
party-crasher here not to speak
Out of respect for her husband
being in jail at the moment and
all It’ll be hard from him to tell
her no Right

EXT AMELIA BOYNTON RESIDENCE - EVENING

Diane Nash knocks on the front door The local leader AMELIA
BOYTON answers then Coretta appears behind her

CLOSE ON Coretta Her face contorts in fear
Diane immediately raises her hands in understanding

NASH
No no He’s okay He’s fine

CORETTA
(gathering herself)
What’s going on then Di

NASH
We need your help

INT CAR - LATER
Nash drives Coretta now smartly dressed for an appearance

CORETTA
If they sent you it’s serious

NASH
Well I think they’re taking this a
bit more seriously than it is But
wouldnt be the first-time I
disagree with the boys

CORETTA
(a beat)
I admire you I do I wish I were
more out there In the trenches

NASH
You do more than you know Mrs
King

CORETTA

Martin often speaks of that night
after the bombing the girls Says
you gave him a lot to think about

NASH

Yeah
(a thoughtful beat)

You know I don’t know how many
arrests How many times spat on and
pushed Hair yanked Punched and
slapped Lost count

(MORE)

NASH (CONTD)
But nothing ever made me want to
hurt someone like those four little
girls laying in the rubble I cried
and cried That night Bevel and I
decided to do one of two things
Either kill the bombers
ourselves

In shock Coretta slowly turns her eyes from the road ahead
to this outspoken young woman by her side

NASH (CONTD)
- or drive dishonorable Governor
George Wallace - who let it happen
encouraged it even - drive that
bastard out of office

Coretta raises her eyebrows Nash wonders if she’s said too
much to the reserved First Lady of the movement A tense
beat Then

CORETTA
(chuckling)
Girl you are something else

NASH
(joining in)
Doc might talk about it kindly now
but at the time he didn’t respond
all that well

CORETTA
To the killin option’

NASH
No I kept that one to myself I
ain’t crazy To the Voting Project
I had a whole plan I presented to
him A trained nonviolent army that
would surround Wallace’s offices in
Montgomery and sever communication
from the state capitol building
Lay our bodies on railroad tracks
Close down the power company A
protracted sit-in on the scale of
the March on Washington

Coretta listens enthralled

NASH (CONTD)
It was too aggressive for Doc I
knew it but I was just so mad
(beat)
(MORE)

NASH (CONT’D)
So Bevel and I came here to Selma
and started some legwork with the
locals And Doc eventually came on
board when the community raised
their voices All I know is
things are happening now And I’m
glad for it

CORETTA
Yes Yes I’m glad too

Off these two very different women driving on side-by-side

INT BROWN CHAPEL MEETING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

A cluster of SCLC leaders - BEVEL NASH WILLIAMS ORANGE -
watch the spectacle before them wide-eyed CORETTA SCOTT
KING speaking intensely with MALCOLM X in a corner

MALCOLM
I mean no disrespect I come with
great respect for your husband
Mrs King

CORETTA
Youve said disrespectful things in
the past Minister So you’1ll
understand why there is some alarm
here tonight

MALCOLM
I do I understand that Your
husband and I we do not see
exactly eye to eye on how to
achieve progress for the Black man
And yes I’ve been piercing in my
critiques of non-violence But
because we don’t agree does not
mean I’m the enemy

CORETTA
What do you intend to say to these
people then sir A lot of work has
been done here I don’t intend to
see it undone tonight

MALCOLM
Mrs King I have recently traveled
to Mecca the Holy Land And I’ve
learned more than I ever previously
knew During the Hajj several
million people of different
nationalities worship in unison

(MORE)

MALCOLM (CONTD)
Let’s just say my eyes see ina
new way But your local Sheriff
here He doesn’t know that So
allow me to be the alternative to
your husband The alternative that
scares them so much they turn to
Dr King in refuge Let my being
here represent the factions that
will come if they don’t give the
good Reverend what he’s asking for -
and soon

CORETTA
If what you’re saying is true I’m
not opposed to you speaking here
tonight Am I to take this as
truth Are you sincere Minister

MALCOLM
I have no army behind me anymore I
have myself and the truth That’s
all I stand on today And I hope it
is enough for you sister

off Coretta convinced

INT SELMA JAIL CELL - DAY

Separated by bars CORETTA stands outside of KING’s cell
She’s face to face with her husband as a WHITE JAILER
occasionally looks on from several feet away

CORETTA
He spoke well but with less um
fire I guess is the word It
seemed to be just as he said His
intention wasn’t to

KING
What did he say again Exactly this
time if you can recall please This
is important

He’s trying to hide his irritation But she knows him

CORETTA
He talked about petitioning the
United Nations for human rights
violations if we didn’t get what we
are asking for He talked about the
field Negro and the house Negro
and

KING
I wonder which one I am in his
scenario Not hard to figure out

CORETTA
It wasn’t like that this time

KING
Do you know what he’s said about us
in the past Coretta He’s called
us “ignorant Negro preachers” He’s
called me a “modern day Uncle Tom”
Said on national television that
the white man pays me to keep
Negros defenseless The white man
pays me How could you allow it

CORETTA
It wasn’t like that Martin I’m
telling you he spoke with some of
the words he’s used before but it
wasn’t aimed at you It was it
had more to do with helping us

KING
Helping us Okay

CORETTA
Not that you need his help I’m
just telling you how it was

KING
This movement our movement has
been the one that’s moved the
needle Our movement changes laws
and day to day life for our people
We lay down our lives against those
dogs and those bombers and those
billy clubs While people like him
talk and shout about it But what
has he changed Actually changed

CORETTA
You don’t sound like yourself You
sound tired

KING
And you sound enamored

She reacts shocked As soon as he says it he regrets it He
reaches through the opening pulling her to him by her waist

KING (CONTD)
I didn’t mean that I just don’t
want this all our momentum to be
in jeopardy - with the people with
the President - because of some
violent rhetoric that ain’t ever
gonna happen I’m disappointed that
he was invited here I’m upset that
you were pulled into it I
I’m I’m tired You’re right

Exhaling he leans his head against the bars She looks at
him with concern Pity even Then leans her head too Faces
close Bodies close

CORETTA
Rest then Rest tonight Martin

A long resistant beat Then a reluctant nod

EXTINT CAPITOL BUILDING - DAY

The center of Montgomery Sunny and pleasant The buildings
display civic pride We look up at the imposing state
capitol

GOVERNOR GEORGE WALLACE stands in the middle of his wood-
paneled office smoking hard Pacing in front of COLONEL AL
LINGO 50ish and the commander of the Alabama State Troopers

WALLACE
(in a quiet rage)

This is NOT what I want to hear
How in fuck’s sake does Malcolm X
slip into MY state meet with the
wife of the other one and make an
ACTUAL SPEECH to these nigras who
are already riled up enough How
does that happen Colonel Lingo

LINGO
Governor

WALLACE
Is every spook militant in
existence gonna pay us a visit
Huh Do you know what this means
Johnsons gonna get jumpy King and
X together is sending him through
the cotton pickin’ stratosphere
And pictures of nigras getting beat
in the street doesn’t help the
matter

LINGO
Governor

WALLACE
Now I cant make a move against
that backwoods white trash Sheriff
Clark cause itll be seen as Im
helping King But someone got to
get Jim Clark under control
Election year’s coming up and this
black voting business won’t abide
Hes got to start giving them
nigras access to the courthouse
Let em fill in a few applications
Treat King with kid gloves Like
they did in Albany And pretty soon
the whole damn rodeo’1ll leave town
Its that simple I mean what’s
not clear about that

LINGO
Jim Clark just dont like to see
niggers in his courthouse Its
that simple Governor

WALLACE
Jesus H Christ Will Clark listen
to you directly

LINGO
Not a chance

Wallace obliterates his cigarette on an ashtray

WALLACE
Goddamit Lingo you telling me I
gotta go down there and sweet-talk
that crazy bastard myself

LINGO
George Im telling you if the Lord
Jesus and Elvis Presley came
visiting and they said Jim we
want you to treat them niggers
nice Jim Clark would beat the
shit out the pair of ‘em then
throw em in jail

A beat of disbelief

WALLACE
Jesus H Christ

LINGO
Look Jim Clarks a good old boy
and a friend of mine - but Jim
Clark just ain’t that scary He’s
playing into their hands Now if
you want to get a handle on this

WALLACE
Go on

LINGO
Find a reason to send some of my
troopers in there See what Jim
dont understand is this is about
dominance He puts em in jail But
Kings lawyers get em out in a day
or so Then they go home feeling
good Tell their kin they saw
action Now if you want fear you
need dominance in Selma Find a
reason to send us in there scare
some real sense into those fuckers

Wallace is all ears

LINGO (CONTD)
Hoover picked up some intel about a
night march Wasn’t announced It’s
some locals outside of King’s
group Unofficial they call it
Supposed to happen tomorrow night
once King leaves jail He bailed
himself out to go to some bleeding
heart fundraiser in California

A thought strikes Wallace He’s putting it all together

WALLACE
King’s out of town Fewer cameras
And at night

Lingo nods

EXT STREET - NIGHT

A poorly-lit side street STATE TROOPERS have penned a group
of JOURNALISTS and PHOTOGRAPHERS against the wall From the
end of the street come SHRIEKS OF FEAR AND PANIC Journalists
strain to see what’s happening

ROY REED
(to a trooper)
You can’t do this

SPIDER
What’s happening down there I need
to get down there

The troopers are a stark contrast to Clark’s possemen and
even his deputies More disciplined cold formidable scary
CLOSE-UP A trooper slips a KNUCKLE-DUSTER onto his hand
Suddenly - THE STREETLIGHTS SWITCH OFF

It’s what the troopers have been waiting for They launch

into the journalists and photographers - clubbing punching
and stomping Every camera is seized and smashed to pieces

EXT STREET - SAME TIME

TROOPERS chase a small group of MARCHERS along a street

We pick out old CAGER LEE his daughter VIOLA and grandson
JIMMIE LEE JACKSON trying to run They catch the attention of
a trooper who focuses on them giving chase Others follow

INT MACK’S CAFE -— CONTINUOUS

A quiet little soul-food café All black patrons A few
CUSTOMERS talk eat and drink coffee in a subdued atmosphere
Theres a jukebox playing John Coltrane’s “A Love Supreme”

Suddenly the door CRASHES open Jimmie and Viola drag Cager
depleted and limp into the café Customers stare at the out-
of-breath threesome

Then TROOPERS burst in One strikes Cager Viola tries to
protect her father Another turns on her Jimmie lunges at
him A third trooper clubs Jimmie then hurls him at the wall

The trooper who was battering Viola takes out his gun and
calmly SHOOTS Jimmie twice in the stomach

A moment of stillness - before Viola screams and the troopers
rampage out of the café Jimmie slumps to the floor

VIOLA
Jimmie Jimmie

Coltrane’s horn wails too

INT CITY MORGUE - DAY

KING walks down a sterile white hallway with a passionate
JAMES BEVEL

BEVEL
We have to be aggressive I say we
lay Jimmie Lee’s body at George
Wallace’s door is Montgomery It’s
no time to be soft Doc

King stops in his tracks and glares at Bevel That word -
“soft” - does NOT sit well But just then CAGER LEE slowly
emerges from the exam room

BEVEL (CONT’D)
(quietly)

That’s Cager Lee That’s the

grandfather

King drops his head A moment to gather himself Then he
tentatively makes his way to the old man

KING
Sir

CAGER
Dr King

KING

There aren’t words to soothe you
Mr Lee There are no words But I
can tell you one thing for certain
God was the first to cry He was
the first to cry for your boy

CAGER
Yessir I believe that

BEVEL
Is your daughter is Jimmie’s
mother here with you Mr Lee

CAGER
She couldn’t

KING
May I ask your age sir

CAGER
I got 82 years 1883 Jimmie born
‘38 He an Army man Was an army
man In the Army for a spell Say
“Pa you gonna vote before you
done” That’s what Jimmie say We
been tryin’ to register ‘fore you
came Five times before I studied
it He took me A good boy Always
good The man just

He makes a gun with his gnarled hand and presses it to King’s
stomach

CAGER (CONTD)

- just shot him right here like
this Two times Right like this
here Then Jimmie gone He gone

King can’t move Silent tears stream down the faces of all
three men

Then slowly he clasps the old man’s hand in his Any
reserve any distance King has held to prevent himself from
becoming fully entrenched in Selma and its people vanishes
He’s in it now Deep

And beyond the exam room door that Cager came from we see
JIMMIE’S BODY On a steel table A strong build Now awaiting
a coffin

KING (VO)
Who murdered Jimmie Lee Jackson

INT BROWN’S CHAPEL - DAY
CLOSE-UP of King enraged Jimmie’s open casket before him

KING
Who murdered Jimmie Lee Jackson

A church packed with MOURNERS Cager and Viola in the front

KING (CONTD)
We know a state trooper acting
under orders of George Wallace
pointed the gun and pulled the
trigger But how many other people
had a finger on that trigger Ill
tell you Every white preacher who
preaches the bible but stays
silent before his white
congregation Every white
politician who feeds on hatred and
prejudice Every white lawman who
abuses the law to terrorize And
every Negro man and woman who
stands by without joining this
fight as their brothers and sisters
are humiliated brutalized and
ripped from this earth

This ripples through the congregation

KING (CONTD)
(quieter)

When I heard President Kennedy had
been shot and killed And when I
heard just yesterday that Malcolm
X who stood in this very church
just three weeks ago had been shot
and killed I turned to my wife
Coretta and said the same thing I
often say when one of our leaders
is struck down “If we haven’t
found something worth dying for
were not fit to live”

King looks down at the casket

KING (CONTD)
But today we’re doing the living
Jimmie and youve done the dying

Cries among the gathered We see CORETTA with soft tears

KING (CONTD)

We will not let your sacrifice pass
in vain dear brother We will not
let it go We will finish what you
were after We will get what you
were denied We will vote and we
will put these men out of office
We will take their power We will
win what you were slaughtered for

The crowd answers back in determined agreement

KING (CONTD)
We’re going back to Washington
We’re going to demand to see the
President And Im going to tell
him Jimmie was murdered by an
administration that spends millions
of dollars every day to sacrifice
life in the name of liberty in
Vietnam Yet lacks the moral will
and the moral courage to defend the
lives of its own people We will
not let it go And if he does not
act We will act We will act We
will do it for all our lost ones
All those who have gone too soon
taken by hate

A roar of support rises from the people JOURNALISTS scribble
furiously some already hurrying out to get to a phone

INT JACKSON HOME - SAME MORNING

RICHIE JEAN shuttles sandwiches into her crowded living room
All of King’s comrades are there

Voices are loud and urgent often overlapping as each tries
to convince the others and make their point

YOUNG

We need a new plan Doc can’t waltz
into LBJ with a list of empty
demands Johnson still has no real
intention of moving forward with
voting laws If we’re not even to
the starting point with him how we
look talking about the finish line

BEVEL
(at the top of his voice)
Because we need to dictate this
conversation Andy Tell them what
we want in no uncertain terms

WILLIAMS
Or else they’1ll try back-peddling

ABERNATHY
Look Maybe we compromise We pick
two or three issues for Marty to
demand Get things started

NASH
Wait Think this through He goes
in there with just two or three
things and we diminish the
negotiation before we even start
it Better to engage Johnson with
all our grievances and let him
whittle it down Because you know
they always whittle it down

ABERNATHY
It’s always all or nothing with
you darlin’ We need finesse here

BEVEL
Ralph don’t patronize her Listen
for a change man

ABERNATHY
I’m listenin’ to a lot of hot air
that’s what I’m listenin’ to

KING
C’mon now Focus Please Let me
hear on the top-tier elements that
should be in any legislation we
want passed Let’s get specific

The group settles down A few moments of all in deep thought

ORANGE
Banning laws that if a Negro tries
to register their name and address
is published in the paper It gives
anyone who wants to do them harm
their exact location and

Williams rises to his feet at full volume sparking the cross-
talk and interruptions again

WILLIAMS
«- C’mon the poll tax has got to
be our focus Blacks are dead
broke but expected to pay for
every year they weren’t legally
registered before they can
register What the hell is that

ABERNATHY
I agree with that If you do ever
actually register to vote let’s
say at the age of 30 you gotta pay
back taxes going back to age 18
before you can cast a vote

WILLIAMS
Who has that kind of money

More ideas and loud voices King looks on taking it all in

BEVEL
I hear you I hear you But the
real issue is the literacy exam
The average person can’t pass it
And if you can it don’t matter
when the local registrar can flunk
you for missing a damn comma

VIVIAN
Listen I think the big issue is
voting vouchers C’mon listen
Everybody forgets this part That
if you’re Negro you can only vote
if an approved registered voter
vouches for you So in Lowndes
County for instance

NASH
Where not one single Negro has
successfully registered to vote in
the 20th century by the way

VIVIAN
Exactly If you live in a place
like Lowndes County where no Negros
are registered and you’ve got to
have somebody who is registered to
vouch for you who do you go to No
one you know - not one Black person
for tens of miles - is registered
How do you get the voucher to
get you in the courthouse door
to take the literacy test to pay
the poll tax to get your name
published and get yourself dead

KING takes a deep breath then looks to Young So much to do

INT WHITE HOUSE - NEXT MORNING
CLOSE-UP of Johnson furious LEE WHITE is with him

JOHNSON
No one invites themselves to the
White House

He’s so enraged he needs a few moments to get a grip

JOHNSON (CONTD)
Well let him come I ain’t seeing
him I’m done talking to King

INT OVAL OFFICE - DAY
JOHNSON and KING are alone Theyre both standing Close

JOHNSON
(challenging)
So whats your next move

KING
A march from Selma to Montgomery
To protest and amplify On Monday

Johnsons jaw drops

JOHNSON
Selma to Montgomery Well I’1l be
damned

(MORE)
JOHNSON (CONTD)
This was always the plan wasn’t
it Wait ‘til you provoked some
tragedy in lil’ ol’ Selma then go
big Get someone killed then go
marching to the state capitol

That hurts but King maintains an unflinching silence

JOHNSON (CONTD)
Selma to Montgomery must be fifty
miles You march those people out
into rural Alabama unprotected and
itll be open season Its too
fuckin’ far and too fuckin’
dangerous

A strategic beat

KING
Then propose legislation sir

For a moment the cool matter-of-factness of this hugely
significant demand takes Johnson’s breath away

JOHNSON
I can’t do that this year I wont
do it I told you I already got
one war Ill be damned if Ill
start another over state law

KING
Eligibility to vote in the United
States is determined by both
federal and state law

JOHNSON
I already lost the South for you
people You want George Wallace to
be the next President of the United
States That’s where you’re headed
by pushing this

KING
By enabling Negroes to vote without
fear you make certain that George
Wallace will never be the next
President of the United States

(rising intensity)

We need your involvement here Mr
President We deserve your help as
citizens of this country under
attack And if you won’t offer
it

(MORE)

KING (CONTD)
Well if you wont offer it Im
going to have to demand it
Publicly In every way I know how

Stung infuriated Johnson comes out of his corner So close
they make physical contact Johnson stares down at King

JOHNSON
You listen to me good Youre an
activist Im a politician You got
one big issue I got a hundred and
one Now you demanding more you
putting me on the spot with this
visit okay Thats your job
thats what you do But I’m sick
and tired of you demandin’ and
telling me what I can do and what I
can’t Now you want support from
me on this voting thing I need
some quid pro quo from you

Eye to eye

KING
What do you want Mr President

JOHNSON
I announce a special commission to
investigate electoral abuses in the
South stating specifically its
being set up in response to the
Selma campaign And you respond by
declaring the Selma campaign a
major victory - exactly what it
would be - and then you announce
its conclusion

Brief silence

KING
Our campaign plan does not include
a special commission as one of its
objectives And certainly not as
its final objective

JOHNSON
Meet me halfway on this Martin

KING
I can’t do that Mister President

JOHNSON
Cant Or won’t
KING
I came here prepared to talk to you
about people People are dying in
the street for this Punished for
wanting for needing to
participate in the American
political process It cannot wait
sir I came here hoping to have a
true collaborative conversation
with you And respectfully Mr
President if you’re not ready to
have it now then I’1l leave as I
came But the conversation will be
had If not here Out there

Johnson stares at King King stares at Johnson

YOUNG
What’s new

WHITE
No no These are particularly
troubling It’s serious Andy
Credible threats - with detail

YOUNG
Okay well if you’ve got such
detail why can’t you shut it down

WHITE
We can I think But we need time

YOUNG
This information coming through the
FBI I assume High-level

White nods

YOUNG (CONTD)

The same high-level that’s been

tracking us like animals bugging

our homes and hotel rooms Digging

for things that aren’t there Lee
(off Lee’s regret)

Listen this feels very convenient

WHITE
Threats are always swirling around
We know this But since Kennedy
there’s been an increased level of
outreach and intel on said threats
There are some things we can
anticipate now that we never knew
to look for previously This is
coming from Lowndes County
Alabama Between Selma and
Montgomery This is real Andy I’m
telling you if he were my guy Id
keep him off the frontlines Just
for awhile

EXTINT KING RESIDENCE - NIGHT

It’s late A streetlamp glows through

The neighborhood is quiet Except for
We hear moans and groans with growing

We pull back to find King standing in
listening in shock to a tape cassette

coffee table

Coretta is seated in an armchair near
at nothing in particular She’s heard

the King front window

-- the SOUNDS OF SEX
intensity

his living room

deck unspooling on the

the window looking out
it already

Suddenly the SOUNDS END and a MALE VOICE begins to speak

VOICE
King look into your heart You

know you are a complete fraud and a

liability to all Negroes You are
evil You could not believe in God
Like all frauds your end is
approaching You are done Your
degrees and your Nobel Prize that
grim farce will not save you The
American public will soon know you
for what you are - an evil
abnormal beast There is only one
thing left for you to do Do it
yourself before it’s done to you

KING
That that isn’t me there
(beat)
It isn’t me Corrie

CORETTA
(quietly)
I know I know what you sound like

A long painful beat

King is stunned Coretta continues to look out the window
struggles to speak What to address first

What to say

He
CORETTA (CONTD)
If I ask you something will you
answer me truthfully No matter
how difficult the answer
(off his silence)
I deserve that

KING
Yes I’1l answer

She finally looks up from the window directly at him

CORETTA

(measured)
I’ve gotten used to a lot All the
nights alone wondering after your
safety worried about how you are
This house Renting here No
foundation Without the things our
children should have all because
of how it would look We live below
where we should be with our
education and the hours and hours
and hours that you work We own
nothing Not a thing But I’ve
become used to it For better or
worse

He looks away not able to withstand her gaze

CORETTA (CONTD)
But what Ive never gotten used to
is the death The constant
closeness of death It’s become
like a thick fog to me I can’t see
life sometimes because of the death
constantly hanging over People
actually form their mouths people
actually say they will stop the
blood moving through the hearts of
my children One time that’s what
they said on the other end of that
phone line It’s always something
like that For how many years now
How many years I’ve had to hear how
they’re going to kill our children
Hear what they say theyll do to
you and how theyll do it The
filth Deranged and twisted and
just ignorant enough to be serious

(beat)

This though This is the worst of
it Because theyre trying to get
inside of this family

(MORE)

CORETTA (CONTD)
Inside of your head Trying to get
you to do it yourself And I cant
have that happen So whatever they
thought this would do it has
failed Do you hear me

He nods

CORETTA (CONTD)
If I ask you something you’ll
answer me with the truth

KING
Yes

CORETTA
Good Because I’m not a fool

She stands They look eye to eye from across the room

CORETTA (CONTD)
Do you love me

What How could she ask that How could she doubt that

KING
Yes Coretta I love you

Then

CORETTA
Do you love any of the others

It’s as if he’s been struck The others Did she say that

All the oxygen leaves him He is deflated The anguish on
his face doesn’t break her resolve

She stands solid Ready for the answer Whatever it may be
He gathers himself pushing through the guilt

KING
No

Coretta takes this in The acknowledgment of what she
feared There are others The truth she needs to continue

off of this man and wife standing on the edge of a marriage

INT KING HOMEJACKSON HOUSE - NIGHT

KING is at home on the phone to YOUNG and ABERNATHY who are
on two separate phones at the Jackson house We INTERCUT

KING
I need to put the march back a day

ABERNATHY
Why

KING
I have to be at home right now

YOUNG
This is good It’s just fine I’d
rather you be home for the start of
it anyhow The real deal is the
finale when we land in Montgomery

Abernathy motions toward Young confused by his response
What are you saying Young ignores him

YOUNG (CONTD)

You join in along the way make the
big speech at the end Unless you
want Ralphy to give the big speech

King plays along offering a reluctant chuckle

KING
Ralphy says he wanna give the big
speech but he’d start sweatin’ fo’
he hit the stage trust me

Abernathy takes the ribbing

ABERNATHY
Man I taught you everything you
know jack You’d still be
preaching Boston University style
if I hadn’t shown you how its done

KING
Well if you both think we’1ll be
okay with a start without me

YOUNG
Organization looks good The mood
is strong The SNCC boys are ready
to go It’d be a mistake to hold
people back when their blood is up

Young is overselling Abernathy mouths “What are you doing”

KING
Any national TV there

ABERNATHY
An ABC camera crew and two
reporters arrived this morning

That’s not a lot Another moment in thought

KING
Okay let’s proceed But only one
of us walks to start I dont want
to get back Monday and find all my
leadership in jail Just one

YOUNG
Understood

KING
Let me know who you choose

Yes indeed

children on Coretta All are sleep

He enters his office pushes rewind on the TAPE RECORDER He
sinks into a chair to listen to the THREATENING VOICE again

Don’t demonize me because I’m Youre the one playing me
not holier than thou Because small Like I’m a follower

Youre mad because they called him
in We were here first and they
called him in I get it I felt it
too But if we are really and truly
“for the people” and the people of
Selma called him - then they have
spoken And if the people want to
march I’m marching with ‘em

FORMAN
(regretfully)
Then brother you’re marching as
John Lewis Not as part of SNCC
It’s been voted on and decided For

EXT PETTUS BRIDGE SELMA SIDE - DAY

It is a chilly March morning Black men and women make up a
silent regiment of MARCHERS close-ranked and walking
steadily toward the Pettus Bridge

WHITE ONLOOKERS mostly women yell and scream insults
Spitting and cursing at the marchers who struggle to just
look straight ahead and continue

They’re led by WILLIAMS and LEWIS who keep on steady
focused step They are vets who’ve done this before

With swampy green water on either side the formidable steel
bridge rises before them in a dramatic arch obscuring the
far side - the Montgomery side And what lies ahead

As we watch this unfold we hear a WHITE MALE VOICE describe
the action we are witnessing in vivid detail

VO

About 525 Negroes had left Brown
Chapel and walked six blocks to
cross Pettus Bridge and the Alabama
River where a cold wind cut at
their faces and whipped their
coats They were young and old and
they carried an assortment of
packs bedrolls and lunch sacks

EXT PETTUS BRIDGE MONTGOMERY SIDE - SAME TIME

We have a CLOSE VIEW on the necks and backs of a tight squad
of STATE TROOPERS They do not move

VO
The troopers were waiting 300 yards
beyond the end of the bridge

From behind the troopers we can see a small and distant line

of heads - the front rank of the MARCHERS - beginning to rise
above the bridge’s crest

EXT PETTUS BRIDGE SELMA SIDE - SAME TIME

A CLOSE-UP of LEWIS WILLIAMS and others in the front of the
march line shows their dawning alarm

We REVERSE ANGLE onto their POV And finally see what they
see

EXT PETTUS BRIDGE MONTGOMERY SIDE - SAME TIME

An army Behind the small front-line TROOPERS are nearly 200
mingled TROOPERS DEPUTIES and POSSEMEN Some of them on
horseback

On either side in storefronts and empty fields are scores of
WHITE SPECTATORS parked up in cars standing around in
groups some standing on car roofs or the backs of pick-ups
They wave Confederate flags brandish clubs hold banners
saying Niggers Go Home and ‘Who Needs Niggers’

VO
Behind the troopers were dozens of
possemen 15 of them on horses and
perhaps 100 white spectators

We pick out the ABC NEWS REPORTER and CAMERA-CREW tensing
for action sensing something significant is about to unfold

A low growl of aggression and excitement rises from the white
spectators as they see the MARCHERS A small crowd of PRESS
are penned away from the road by TROOPERS

Nearby are a handful of AMERICAN NAZIS including the one
who assaulted King in the hotel They eye the journalists
with hostility

Beyond all this are TROOPER TRUCKS blocking off all four
lanes of Route 80 AL LINGO leans on the hood of one them
arms folded Next to him on horseback SHERIFF JIM CLARK

Clark urges his horse forward to join his deputies He nods
to the POSSEMEN around him One in particular is tightening
the barbed wire around his club

EXT PETTUS BRIDGE DAY

LEWIS WILLIAMS and the front rank of MARCHERS have taken in
the extent of the forces confronting them Williams looks
nervously down into the muddy waters of the Alabama River
choppy in the wind Struck by a thought he turns to Lewis

WILLIAMS
Can you swim

LEWIS
No swimming pools for black folk
where I come from

WILLIAMS
Yeah

The troopers are flanked shoulder-to-shoulder across both
sides of the divided four-lane highway They hold nightsticks
at the ready while the marchers make their approach walking
two by two Slowly and silently

VO
The Marchers descended the slope
towards the small army TROOPERS
DEPUTIES and POSSEMEN formed into
ranks When the Negroes were 50
feet away a voice came over an
amplifying system commanding them
to stop They stopped

A trooper comes through from the rear and hands the officer-
in-charge MAJOR CLOUD a bullhorn

We notice the troopers have GAS-MARKS and TEAR-GAS GRENADES
hanging from their belts

Lewis Williams and the marchers halt a few yards from Cloud
Everything goes quiet Cloud raises his bullhorn

CLOUD
This is an unlawful assembly You
have two minutes to disperse

Brief silence Williams is surprised by the ultimatum

WILLIAMS
(mutters to himself)
Two minutes

The troopers put on their gas-masks becoming strikingly
alien and sinister Williams takes a step towards Cloud

WILLIAMS (CONT’D)
May we have a word with the Major

CLOUD
There is no word to be had

The camera picks out AMELIA BOYNTON ANNIE LEE COOPER DR
SULLIVAN AND RICHIE JEAN JACKSON COLLEGE-AGED DAUGHTER and
HER BOYFRIEND and other familiar faces all waiting for the
next move with mounting anxiety

LEWIS
Major Cloud may we speak with you

CLOUD
Troopers Advance

The troopers advance at an aggressive RUN smashing into the
front rank of marchers immediately creating a grotesque rag-
doll domino-effect deep into the crowd

Williams falls Lewis is battered down The troopers tear
into the screaming throngs of black citizens who cover their
heads with their hands as instructed

Two gun-shots Cut to CLARK on horseback pistol raised in
the air Clark and his possemen race forward with rebel
yells Horses ride into a low-lying fog of tear-gas Masked
troopers rear and strike like monsters from the deep One of
them smashes his stick down onto LEWIS as he tries to get up
off the ground AMELIA BOYNTON lies on the ground
unconscious

The WHITE MALE VOICE continues his description And as he
says it we see it

VO
The troopers rushed forward their
blue uniforms and white helmets
blurring into a flying wedge as
they moved The first 10 or 20
Negroes were swept to the ground
screaming arms and legs flying and
packs and bags went skittering
across the grassy divider Those
still on their feet retreated The
troopers continued pushing using
both the force of their bodies and
the prodding of their nightsticks
A cheer went up from the white
spectators lining the south side of
the highway The mounted possemen
spurred their horses and rode at a
run into the retreating mass The
Negroes cried out as they crowded
together for protection and the
whites on the sideline whooped and
cheered Suddenly there was a sharp
sound like a gunshot and a gray
cloud spewed over the troopers and
the Negroes Tear gas someone
yelled The cloud began covering
the highway Newsmen who were
confined by four troopers to a
corner 100 yards away began to
lose sight of the action But
before the cloud finally hid it all
there were several seconds of
unobstructed view Fifteen or
twenty nightsticks could be seen
through the gas flailing at the
heads of the marchers

We see the DOCTORS and NURSES watch in horror from the Selma
side of the bridge as BLACK MARCHERS stream back across
running for their lives Troopers and possemen on horseback
and on foot give chase after them Running them down with
whips and cattle prods

SEVERAL PEOPLE still lay on the grass strip where the
troopers had knocked them down including JOHN LEWIS and
AMELIA BOYNTON Two troopers order them to get up but the
injured cannot move

The DOCTORS and NURSES make a move to go help but are held

back by Posseman To their disbelief a trooper drops a tear
gas cannister near Amelia’s limp body Lewis laying injured
nearby struggles to his feet blinded and gasping to pick

Amelia up and drag her across the bridge

All of the DOCTORS and NURSES are in tears of anger as they

The picture changes abruptly to an ANNOUNCER
ANNOUNCER (ON TV)

We interrupt our feature Judgement

pictures of astonishing events from

earlier today in Selma Alabama
We see a snippet of TELEVISION FOOTAGE of the bridge attack
Everyone present stands close and around the television with
King in the middle The light of the transmission flickers
across their faces

In the vicious maltreatment of
defenseless citizens of Selma

the disease of racism which is
destroying all of America No

INT JACKSON RESIDENCE - DAY

The Jackson family’s small DAUGHTER answers the back door and
her eyes open wide in surprise

DAUGHTER
Mama Santa Claus is here

We see what she sees now A white man with an impressive
white beard and long black robe He is Greek Orthodox
ARCHBISHOP IAKOVOS He gives her a warm smile

Iakovos enters to find KING who is very moved They embrace

KING
You came

ARCHBISHOP IAKOVOS
You called and we came You’re not
alone

INT JACKSON RESIDENCE - SHORT TIME LATER

KING stands with ARCHBISHOP IAKOVOS in the laundry room as
the high priest takes off his hat and coat and places them
in a small satchel on a washing machine hard at work

KING
Is this all you brought my friend

IAKOVOS
More than enough

KING
It gets very cold here You might
need a heavier overcoat for the
march I’1ll see about it

TAKOVOS
I’ll be fine This feels like home

KING
Greece

TAKOVOS
No Connecticut

They chuckle at this Then a seriousness overcomes King

KING
My friend it’s not Connecticut I
need you to stay very close to us
And to be very very careful Don’t
take anything for granted with the
white citizens here

TAKOVOS
I understand Martin

Iakovos puts his hand on King’s shoulder as an old friend
would

IAKOVOS (CONTD)
Do not allow the darkness to
envelop your soul my friend When
you see it approaching you keep it
at a distance with your courage and
determination There are so many
blessings surrounding you today
You are armored with all the
spiritual weapons of legitimate
opposition And you will march
forward to a new world You will
find critics even opponents even
enemies even faults and errors in
your own thinking and
understanding but nothing should
discourage you or turn you into a
deserter

King is moved by the intention and intensity of his friend’s
words and takes it all in

IAKOVOS (CONTD)
Ours is a commitment to true
justice and to true peace founded
upon a respect for life and liberty
and justice for everyone

King nods solemnly
IAKOVOS (CONTD)
That last part was from the Pledge

of Allegiance

They smile
IAKOVOS (CONTD)
So it’s got to be right Right

WHITE
No That’s reality This is advice

JOHNSON (CONTD)
I’ve got Congress calling me by the
dozens I’ve got picketing outside
that gets bigger and bigger every
day he tugs on their gotdamn white
liberal fucking guilt Every march
pulls at ‘em Especially when folks
are getting beat in the fucking
streets These pictures are moving
around the world You tell Wallace
and those backwater hicks that I
don’t want to see any more of this
horseshit And you tell King he
best not march you hear me And I
damn well mean it King needs to
stop and Wallace needs to stop or
I’1l stop ‘em both

He slams the paper down and we see a photo of AMELIA BOYNTON
being dragged unconscious through clouds of tear-gas

WHITE
SCLC already filed an appeal to
Wallace’s order this morning You
know whose docket it landed on

Johnson rolls his eyes and looks up at the ceiling both
hands on his hips He can’t catch a break

Behind closed doors a black attorney FRED GRAY stands
before the white jurist in question JUDGE FRANK JOHNSON

GRAY
Judge Johnson in light of Sunday’s
bloody turn of events we’re
proceeding with extreme caution and
commitment to safety The SCLC is
seeking a federal court order
enjoining the state authorities
from interfering in the next march

JUDGE JOHNSON
Gray you’re asking me to overturn
the Governor’s mandate and to do so
without a hearing Now it might
well go the way of your petition
from what I’ve read thus far but
it’s not going to happen at all
without a proper proceeding

EXT MONTGOMERY AIRSTRIP - DAY
We watch as a cluster of CATHOLIC NUNS exit a small airplane

GRAY (VO)

After Dr King’s call-to-action
which was nationally televised
sir weve seen hundreds of people
from across the country travel in
for tomorrow’s march Mostly white
Most are clergy of some kind King
is positioned to lead this
tomorrow Judge

A group of LOCAL WHITE MEN eye them nearby making obscene
gestures and lewd comments

INT JUDGE’S CHAMBERS - DAY

Judge Johnson has now come from around his desk to speak with
SCLC Attorney Gray face to face

Youll have your day in court on
Thursday No march on Tuesday I
won’t oppose him against protocol

Youve opposed him before Your
Honor

Indeed I have and with pleasure
But properly This is my offer

INT JACKSON RESIDENCE - SAME TIME

A private conversation between KING and a suited white man at
the dining room table It is ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL JOHN
DOAR Young and Archbishop Iakovos are there as well

SUPERIMPOSE Jackson Residence Selma King visited by
Assistant Attorney General John Doar Greek Orthodox
Archbishop Iakovos and Andrew Young present See Office of AG

for detail LOGGED

DOAR
I’m here on the President’s order
to try to make this work Doctor
Please work with me

While Doar addresses King it’s Young who answers

YOUNG
We give up the march and you give
what We asked for federal
protection And with no disrespect
when the Assistant Attorney General
is the highest ranking federal
official in Selma we have our
answer and its not the one we want

DOAR
(recovering)
Dr King if you do march not only
are you defying a federal judges
offer but you place yourself at
great personal risk

Young shakes his head Why’d he have to go and say that

DOAR (CONTD)
(to Young)
Tell me you’ve told him

YOUNG
(unfazed)

Marty they’ve been telling us
about increased threats I saw no
reason to burden you with it since
a threat is a threat and you walk
with them daily

(MORE)
YOUNG (CONTD)
But so you know the feds are
suddenly and conveniently very
concerned
(to Doar)
Consider him told

Doar is in a losing battle here

KING
Mr Doar thousands have gathered
here to demonstrate their dignity
I don’t want to challenge Judge
Johnson I don’t want to go against
the President I don’t want any of
this I simply want to make certain
that men like me can self-determine
just like you The President could
stop this with a stroke of his pen
He chooses not to The decision is
with your side sir not ours

DOAR
Dr King you understand the
complexities here I know you do
If you march against a Federal
Judge’s order there are
implications The President doesn’t
want that for you

King smiles a little at the veiled threat

KING
I might also suggest you speak with
Governor Wallace and Sheriff Clark
and urge them against violence
instead of trying to persuade us
not to have a peaceful protest

Checkmate Doar gives in

DOAR
Maybe maybe we can make a deal

King and Young are all ears

DOAR (CONTD)

What if I could assure you that the
administration would endorse a
later march if tomorrow is called
off We need a few days to manage
this Minimize the fall-out

YOUNG
You mean to get on the right side

DOAR
That’s exactly what I mean

KING
Are you authorized to offer that

DOAR
Well that’s why I asked “what
if” What if I could get that done
He’s closer than you may think to
coming around on this issue I
believe this compromise might be
agreeable

KING
Please express my meaning here
clearly We are not going to stop
demonstrating protesting and
agitating until a law ensuring that
every Negro can vote undeterred is
passed If he’ll agree to not only
endorse a later march but also
order protection for that march
we have a deal If not were
crossing that bridge on Tuesday

Off Doar determined

EXT BROWN CHAPEL - DAY

Thousands gather outside In the mix is JAMES REEB in
priest’s collar who speaks to reporter ROY REED

REEB

I am a Unitarian Universalist
minister I’ve come from Boston to
lend my skin color to our brothers
and sisters struggling here Maybe
our skin will help their cause
somehow I do not know but I’m
here to try Because this is wrong

The housewife VIOLA LUIZZO is handing sandwiches to the
marchers along with other organized volunteers

INTEXT BROWN CHAPEL STEPS - DAY

KING stands just inside the church doors He leans to whisper
to ANDREW YOUNG

KING
Anything

YOUNG
No word on an agreement Nothing

KING shakes his head then steps forward to address thousands
of COLLEAGUES and SUPPORTERS via bullhorn

KING
The President doesn’t want us to
march today The courts don’t want
us to march today But we must
march today We must stand up
today We must make a massive
demonstration of moral certainty
today I’m glad we are here
together today I thank you for
standing up today

In the background rises the sound of a semi-rhythmic tread -
the sound of a multitude on the march Singing for freedom

MANY VOICES (VO)
We Shall Overcome Someday Oh
deep in my heart I do believe
That we shall overcome Some Day

EXT PETTUS BRIDGE - DAY

King leads an orderly march of two thousand disciplined
marchers Many new white faces including the housewife
VIOLA LUIZZO the preacher REV JAMES REEB and the Greek
ARCHBISHOP

Many black locals who marched before Some still bearing
bandages from the bridge attack just days ago We feel both
the fear and the determination

As they walk ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL JOHN DOAR jogs up to
Andrew Young flanked by two FBI agents Doar whispers in his
ear Young nods his understanding then calmly picks up his
pace He reaches King in the very first row of marchers
directly ahead of him He whispers in King’s ear

YOUNG
There’s a partial deal They’1l
endorse a later march but they
won’t order protection

King walks on somewhat stunned He’s negotiating a deal not
to march at the very moment he’s about to lead thousands to
the bridge His dilemma is written all over his face as the
throngs behind him sing freedom songs in lock step

KING
(to Young)
No deal

Further back in the crowd a WHITE MARCHER leans to a BLACK
MARCHER as they cross under a sign EDMUND PETTUS BRIDGE

WHITE MARCHER
Who is Edmund Pettus

BLACK MARCHER
Don’t right know But his kin
prolly waitin’ for us on the other
side of this here bridge

As King and the crowd make their way over the crest of the
bridge we see their expressions as they face an ominous
sight

A phalanx of flashing lights and police cars Horses mounted
by local whites seething with anger - again Confronting them
all is MAJOR CLOUD holding a bullhorn flanked by TROOPERS

The silence is deafening as marchers nervously look upon blue-
helmeted troopers with confederate emblems who surround them
on three sides ready to charge at any moment

And then - the unexpected

CLOUD
Troopers Withdraw

Troopers divide and move aside leaving the road wide open
for the marchers

Jaws drop Some people clap The marchers are in amazement
All stare at the road ahead leading into rural Alabama

But not King He stands still We are CLOSE ON HIM Watching
the wheels turn

Why would they do that Why would they make a path for a
march they have forbidden What’s their play King hesitates
for a moment longer - then is certain

KING
(to himself)
No

He turns around to look in the faces of the men and women
following him Unsure of what to do how to tell them

Then slowly he goes down on one knee And slowly row after
row the marchers do the same

They pray in what seems an eternal silence - before King gets
to his feet followed by everyone else

Suddenly he stands and walks through the crowd back towards
Selma Marchers peel away to let him through then follow

In the crowd we see JAMES FORMAN of SNCC seething He
stares at his former friend JOHN LEWIS who is confused

EXT SELMA WOODS - THAT NIGHT

We see WHITE LOCALS gathered around a pick-up truck angry
that they didn’t see action

EXT SELMA HOUSING PROJECTS - THAT NIGHT

We see BLACK LOCALS gathered on stoops angry they didn’t
make progress

EXT SELMA DINER - THAT NIGHT
We see WHITE CLERGY including JAMES REEB gathered at a

local eatery perplexed and frustrated that they came all
this way to turn around

EXT BROWN CHAPEL - LATER THAT DAY

KING WILLIAMS BEVEL and ORANGE approach the back-entrance
to the chapel They’re confronted by a group of YOUNG
MILITANTS holding a banner saying ‘Martin LOSER King’ As
King’s group gets closer the militants break into mocking
cries of ‘De Lawd’ and a derisive chorus

MILITANTS
Aint gon’ let nobody turn me round

King is deeply pained by all this Williams Bevel and Orange
instinctively form a line alongside him a symbolic shield

INT BROWN CHAPEL SANCTUARY - A SHORT TIME

A tense MEETING of the Selma campaign leadership KING is
under attack and he’s not taking it well

LEWIS
People are angry Dr King Angry
They went back to the bridge
because they were hot about Sunday
(MORE)

LEWIS (CONTD)
That was our moment out there
today That was our chance

FORMAN
And you threw it away

KING
They couldve sealed off the road
behind us No food water no kind
of support allowed through We
wouldnt have made ten miles

LEWIS
You saying it was a trap

KING
I don’t know what it was

FORMAN
That was no trap You know why they
opened the road to us Because all
them nice respectable white folks
was with us And we shouldve
capitalized on that Because they
wont be around long They never
are

King’s staff is awash with mixed feelings We see ABERNATHY
YOUNG and VIVIAN steadfast in their support We see WILLIAMS
BEVEL NASH and ORANGE supportive but disappointed

ABERNATHY
It was Marty’s call It’s done

FORMAN
He made the wrong fucking call

The disrespect of Forman’s profanity stops everyone in their
tracks Except for Lewis who slams his hand down and stares
at his former friend with rage

LEWIS
Two days ago you didn’t wanna march
at all Now you mad ‘cause this
didn’t go the way you want You are
about you James This is about the
people Back off brother Now

Off Forman’s shock Lewis turns to King
LEWIS (CONTD)

What happened out there Tell me
something Please

King sees this young man has a lot at stake but holds back

KING
Id rather people be upset and hate
me than be bleeding or dead

INTEXT KING HOMEJACKSON HOME - LATER THAT NIGHT

CT VIVIAN peers out of the kitchen window to check on KING
who sits on the BACK PORCH of the Jackson home in Selma King
is writing a letter in a notebook

INTERCUT with the KING CHILDREN at the dinner table in their
Atlanta home eating dinner and chattering away as CORETTA
leans against a wall in the hallway She reads the words of
King’s letter with a faraway look

KING (VO)
At a time when I need you I cannot
call you And I have done this to
myself To us Whatever I am I owe
to my family and to those who stand
with me But my biggest debt is to
you You give my life meaning
Coretta All I can pledge to you
now is that I will strive to
justify the faith you once had in
me I will try more than ever to
make my life one that you can be
proud of I will do in private that
which I know my public position
demands and what is right and
pure It is foolish to think I can
solve a problem in the same mind
set that it was created I must
raise my mind higher And I will
This is a moment Corrie A moment -
that will not happen again

In Atlanta over the voices of her children Coretta
carefully folds the letter and tucks it in her skirt pocket
Then re-joins her kids

In Selma King looks up suddenly as a figure approaches from
the nearby driveway JAMES ORANGE emerges from the darkness

ORANGE
We should head on in now Doc

KING
Yes Yes okay

EXT SELMA DINER - SAME NIGHT

JAMES REEB and his two WHITE COMPANIONS exit the diner onto a
quiet Selma street

Watching them from a parked car are four men - KLANSMEN

KLANSMAN 1
Sick of these Northerners telling
us when and how and where Trying
to control our niggers when they
got ghettos in their own cities

KLANSMAN 2
Told you best we take care of this
ourself Told ya that weeks back

KLANSMAN 1
I’m listenin’ now old friend I’m
listenin’ now

As Reeb and his companions pass the Klan gets out their car
They talk loud enough for Reeb and the others to hear them

KLANSMAN 1 (CONTD)
You know what I hate more than
niggers

KLANSMAN 2
What’s that

KLANSMAN 1
White niggers

REEB and his colleagues turn around to face their foes

REEB
Look we don’t want trouble okay

KLANSMAN 1
No You came here stirrin’ trouble

The Klansmen start toward Reeb and his friends who begin to
run The racists catch up quickly and launch into the three
men with clubs and knuckle-dusters

We watch the priest and other religious men be BEATEN with
Reeb taking a particularly devastating blow to the head All
three are BARELY CONSCIOUS when the attack finally stops The
main attacker whispers in Reeb’s bloody ear

KLANSMAN
Now you know what being a nigger
feels like ‘round here boy

One last SKULL-FRACTURING KICK to Reeb’s head Then the
Klan saunters to their car honk the horn and drive away

INT JACKSON RESIDENCE - EARLY MORNING

BEVEL and NASH walk slowly through the house They pass the
men of the movement preparing for the day in every corner

CT VIVIAN irons on the dining room table The ARCHBISHOP puts
on his habit and robes in the living room WILLIAMS cleans
his shoes ORANGE stirs his coffee

All the while RICHIE JEAN cooks

Bevel and Nash find KING shaving in the bathroom with the
door slightly ajar Bevel knocks and goes in Nash waits
outside We stay with her near the door listening to the
conversation from the hall The others begin to gather near
her to listen as well We watch their faces react

for you But when you have people
coming inside the White House
Inside On a tour They just sat
down Martin Sat right in the main
floor corridor singin’ and
shoutin’ I won’t have it Im
trying here We’re getting close on
the figuring something out about
this voting thing But I won’t have
this

INTERCUT KING and JOHNSON PHONE CALL

KING
Mr President I do not control
every American who is outraged by
your inaction But you control your
in action sir

JOHNSON
Now you wait a minute

KING
I cannot stop any

JOHNSON
You can You can stop it

KING
No YOU can stop it YOU sir can
do more I’m glad to hear you
called Rev Reeb’s widow sir
That’s very fine and it is right I
only wish Jimmie Lee Jacksons
family would have received the same
consideration from their President

JOHNSON
Don’t lay your guilt at my feet
Reverend You are the choosing to
be away from your family and your
wife to be sending those people out
to slaughter when we told you there
was trouble

That hits a nerve The guilt of all of this is weighing on
King and the cracks are becoming larger

KING
You could stop this by protecting
us We won’t sit idle while you
wait a year or two to send this
bill up at your leisure That
should be clear by now Why has it
taken so long to send the bill to
Congress sir Why are

JOHNSON

You listen to me

(deep breath)
This bill has been nearly
impossible to craft you hear me
Youre not the only one jugglin’
I’m jugglin Martin It’s got to be
bullet-proof This is not a two-
line bill It’s got to pass or I
look like a horse’s ass siding with
you We can’t risk defeat or
dilution on this one It’s got to
go up there clean simple and
powerful That requires consensus
and that is not an easy task It
takes time don’t you understand I
cannot snap my fingers on this

KING
If I concede that then can you

tell me this sir
(MORE)

KING (CONTD)
Why do you allow your citizens to
walk into harm’s way without
protection or at the very least
harnessing the men who mean to do
them harm That has nothing to do
with drafting a bill

JOHNSON
You listen to me I will not be
blackjacked into hasty action do
you understand me sir I will not

King is insulted But he takes a moment lowers his voice and
evens his tone with calculation

KING
I’m a preacher from Atlanta You
are the man who won the presidency
of the world’s most powerful nation
by the greatest landslide in
history four months ago

Johnson remains silent deep in thought

KING (CONTD)
And you are the man dismantling
your own legacy with each passing
day No one will remember the Civil
Rights Act They will remember the
stand-off in Selma while you never
set foot in the state When you
refused to protect old women who
marched for their rights They’1l
remember men being slayed in the
streets while struggling for their
dignity unprotected You’1l be
remembered in the same way they’ll
remember George Wallace and Jim
Clark They will remember you
saying “Wait” and “I can’t”

(a beat)
Unless you act sir

A long pause Each man only hears the other breathing

JOHNSON
I’m a greatly anguished man Martin

KING
(burdened )
I know how that feels Mr
President

EXT SELMA STREET - EARLY EVENING

JOHN LEWIS stands curbside on a residential street He looks
antsy Or is it nervous

Moments later the familiar blue Pontiac rolls towards him

When the car stops to let him in Lewis is surprised to find
King driving alone He climbs in

KING
Evenin’
LEWIS
Evenin’ You’re driving alone
KING
A rare treat
LEWIS
Is that a good idea
KING
Well I rather enjoy it
LEWIS
But it’s not very safe You

being alone just driving around

King nods at the rearview mirror Off King Lewis does too
Behind them he sees a follow car driven by JAMES ORANGE

LEWIS (CONTD)
Oh

They pass through the local housing project a bleak
miserable set of stubby brick buildings

KING
I wanted to speak privately I know
there are troubles with your group
I apologize that our efforts have
caused a rift between you all
That’s a painful thing I know and
I’m truly sorry it’s happened

LEWIS
I yes it’s painful

KING
I’ve watched you and I wish I could

say you remind me of myself
(MORE)

KING (CONTD)
But when I was your age I only
wanted to marry this beauty I’d met
named Coretta Scott and lead my own
church away from my Daddy Wasn’t
half as activated as you John

LEWIS
Thank you Dr King

A comfortable silence as they drive along

KING
LBJ is not moving John I thought
he would but our efforts are not
working I can’t risk another march
with people getting killed when its
not working I won’t do it I
wanted you to hear it from me

LEWIS
But The people were ready
Theyre ready They asked for this
They asked you to do this with
them

KING
Even if we do get the court mandate
tomorrow what are we walking
toward We need voting not
marching You know that We need to
move beyond these protests to some
real political power This cannot
go on forever like this I can’t go
on like this

King stops himself Too much He’s confided too much As the
car rides along in the night Lewis finds his voice

LEWIS
When when I headed up SNCC’s
Freedom Ride and the bus reached
the Montgomery city limits the
police escort disappeared We saw
the Greyhound station completely
deserted and I thought “This
is not good” We got off And out
of nowhere from all directions
they came Men women Kids too A
couple hundred white folk They
came out of alleys and side
streets From all directions at
once like they’d been let out of a
gate somewhere

(MORE)

LEWIS (CONTD)
They had every makeshift weapon you
could think of Bats bricks
boards chains tire irons pipes
rakes “Git them niggers” was all I
heard over the screaming I
remember a little kid clawing her
nails into the side of the face of
my friend Jessie while her Daddy
beat him with an ax handle

King is entranced by the story

LEWIS (CONT’D)

Jessie was unconscious but they
kept beating on him I passed out
on the asphalt I guess Later on
they told me someone had swung a
wooden Coke crate against my skull

(off King’s grimace)
Next day I found myself patched up
sitting in a church I could barely
hold my head up but you were gonna

be speaking and I needed to hear
you I needed to hear you
(beat)

Outside the church we could hear
the white mob chanting “Nigger
King” So I knew you were close

At this the two men involuntarily chuckle A laugh at the
ridiculousness of it all A laugh to keep from crying

LEWIS (CONT’D)
You got up there I was feeling
down And you got up there Do you
remember this at all

KING
I don’t think we remember it the
same way
(beat)
What’d I say John

Lewis takes a moment to conjure the memory

LEWIS
You said that on television and
in the papers the congregation
might look to some like just a
mass But you knew that every
person sitting there had overcome
something great to even be there
You praised them for their courage

(MORE)

LEWIS (CONTD)
You criticized the officials who
created the hostile environment in
which we’re made to live

He continues to describe that night full of emotion

LEWIS (CONTD)
And you told us that we would
triumph That we would triumph
because there could be no other
way You said “The people who
oppose us will have to face the
fact that we are determined to be
free” And then you said you
said what I’m about to tell you
now And I hope you hear me “Fear
not We’ve come too far to turn
back”

Off King deeply moved as they ride on in the night

INT WALLACE’S OFFICE - MORNING
Wallace reads the paper about to explode as LINGO looks on

The headline of the Montgomery Advertiser reads

WALLACE BLOCK OF KING MARCH MAY BE
OVERTURNED IN FEDERAL COURT

WALLACE
Mary

INT WHITE HOUSE - DAY

President Johnson and Governor Wallace sit on opposite
couches in the Oval smiling cordially

JOHNSON
Well Governor You wanted to talk

WALLACE
Mr President malcontents are
disrupting Alabama and it is your
responsibility to stop them

Wallace doesn’t look as strong as his words especially under
Johnson’s withering stare

INT FEDERAL COURTROOM - CONTINUOUS

JUDGE JOHNSON is on the bench KING and SCLC attorney FRED
GRAY look on from the plaintiffs table

JOHNSON
Southern Christian Leadership
Conference vs State of Alabama
I’1l now hear plaintiff testimony

CUT TO

GRAY
Can you tell the court what
occurred on the Edmund Pettus
Bridge in Selma this past Sunday

One at a time we see an array of PEOPLE WE RECOGNIZE stand
with one hand raised and one hand on the bible pledging to
tell the truth And one by one we watch them do just that

We see LEWIS WILLIAMS BOYNTON ARCHBISHOP IAKOVOS SULLIVAN
and RICHIE JEAN JACKSON and ANNIE LEE COOPER tell their
stories with animated hand gestures and determined
expressions as STATE ATTORNEYS and SEATED OFFICIALS glare at
them in open contempt

Then we watch the defense call SHERIFF CLARK and CHIEF BAKER
give their accounts of the incident with the same vigor

Over these testimonials WE HEAR

JOHNSON (VO)
Governor you can’t stop a fever by
putting an icepack on your head
Youve got to get to the cause of
the fever All the dramatics you
got going down there won’t solve
the issue They’re protesting for
the right to vote and the way
they’re treated in your state
That’s your problem your
responsibility on your watch

WALLACE (VO)
Well Mr President I disagree
We have a certain way things are
done It’s the way it is and its
the way the people want it to stay

JOHNSON (VO)
George why ya doing this Spent
your career working for the poor
Why you off on this black thing

INT OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Johnson is now on the edge of his couch with an aggressive
posture

WALLACE
Because you can’t never satisfy
them First it’s the front seat on
the bus next it’s takeover of the
parks then it’s the public
schools then it’s voting then
it’s jobs then it’s distribution
of wealth without work

Johnson look upon Wallace with impatient pity then rises and
walks over to him At 6’4 the President towers over just
about everyone when standing But with Wallace seated his
hovering is particularly intimidating

JOHNSON
George you see all those
demonstrators out in front of the
White House keeping my Lady Bird
awake all the damn night

WALLACE
Oh yes Mr President I saw them

JOHNSON
Well why don’t you and I go out
there and let’s announce that
youve decided to let the blacks
vote undeterred and this whole mess
will go away And I don’t have to
draft bills and force the issue and
all that Let’s do that George
Why don’t you just let the niggers
vote You agree they got the right
to vote don’t you

WALLACE
There’s no quarrel with that I
know that That’s the law

JOHNSON
Well then why don’t you let ‘em
vote

WALLACE

I don’t have that power That
belongs to the county registrars

JOHNSON
George don’t shit me as to who
runs Alabama

WALLACE
I don’t have any legal power over
the county registrars Mr
President They have their
regulations and they adhere

JOHNSON
Why don’t you persuade them

WALLACE
I don’t think I could do that

JOHNSON

Now don’t shit me George Wallace
Are you trying to fuck over your
President Are you

WALLACE
Mr President

JOHNSON
You and I shouldn’t be even
thinking about 1965 We should be
thinking about 1985 We’1l both be
dead and gone then Now you’ve got
a lot of poor people in Alabama A
lot of people needin’ jobs You
could do a lot for them In 1985
what do you want left behind You
want them remembering you sayin’
“Wait” and “I can’t” and “It’s
hard”

Wallace gathers his strength and looks Johnson in the eye

WALLACE
I don’t right care what they think
And you shouldn’t neither

Not the right answer An infuriated Johnson leans in close
So close Wallace can feel the breath on his ear

JOHNSON
I’1l be damned if history puts me
in the same place with the likes of
you

INT FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - LATER

KING stands in the hallway in conversation with his staff as
they await a decision Suddenly everyone starts to look
behind him in surprise

He turns around to find CORETTA walking toward him He walks
toward her

KING
You’re here

CORETTA
Yes I’m here

KING
I’m glad

CORETTA
Good

No grand gestures No romantic glances Just a first step
And right now it’s enough

INT FEDERAL COURTROOM - DAY

KING is on the stand visibly nervous and very clearly
exhausted as the STATE ATTORNEY questions him aggressively

STATE ATTORNEY
Mister King you went out on that
bridge in direct violation of this
Judge’s order not to march You
intentionally disobeyed this Judge
and the Governor did you not

KING
I respect this Judge perhaps more
than any other jurist on the bench
We know that in his court we would
at least be given a fair proceeding
as is our rights as citizens

STATE ATTORNEY
I don’t need you preaching and
prancing in here ya hear I want
an answer

JUDGE JOHNSON
Watch it Counselor

STATE ATTORNEY
I’m trying very hard Judge

JUDGE JOHNSON
(to the Attorney)
Try harder
(to King)
Answer the question posed

King’s staff watches the testimony with sympathy now
understanding his burden more than ever Coretta looks on
with deep concern for her husband under such stress

KING
Thousands of people came to Selma
aroused by Sunday’s brutal acts
exacted by officials of the city of
Selma and the state of Alabama I
felt if I had not lead the march
pent up emotions and inner tensions
would have led to an uncontrollable
retaliatory situation a violent
situation on both sides I made a
difficult decision not wanting to
see violence Otherwise I would
have never proceeded anywhere
against this court’s order

Off Judge Johnson who doesn’t look pleased
CUT TO

JUDGE JOHNSON is about to rule KING and GRAY on one side
STATE ATTORNEY and CLARK on the other side and everyone
behind them await the fate of the campaign

JUDGE JOHNSON
I’ve heard testimony from both
sides and reviewed the march
logistics proposal The evidence of
this case reflects a continuous
pattern of action to provoke
disturbance and arrest by the SCLC
and affiliated organizations The
evidence also reflects an almost
continuous pattern on the part of
defendant Sheriff Clark and cohorts
of harassment intimidation
threats and brutal mistreatment
toward the plaintiffs

(MORE)

JUDGE JOHNSON (CONTD)
It seems basic to our
constitutional principles that the
extent of the right to assemble
demonstrate and march peaceably
along the highway in an orderly
manner should be commensurate with
the enormity of the wrongs that are
being protested and petitioned
against In this case the wrongs
are enormous Therefore the extent
of the right to demonstrate in an
estimated five day March from Selma
to Montgomery has been approved
accordingly

The courtroom hums with reaction from both sides King
doesn’t react but remains still as he continues listening to
the Judge’s instructions

DIANE NASH leans over to whisper to CORETTA

NASH
Doesn’t look very happy about it

CORETTA
Now he has to actually do it

INT WHITE HOUSE - DAWN

In casual clothes JOHNSON stands at a window listening to
the singing from protestors holding a weekend vigil outside

PROTESTORS (VO)
Well walk hand in hand well walk
hand in hand Well walk hand in
hand someday

Behind Johnson on the table is a half-eaten breakfast
briefing books and the usual selection of newspapers Every
front page is about Selma A New York Times headline below
the main story is Thousands More Head South in Protest

WHITE is standing by the table watching Johnson
PROTESTORS (VO)
Here in my heart I do believe

That we shall overcome someday

Johnson turns from the window looks at White and gives a
long deep sigh of acceptance

JOHNSON
Lee I need a speech A good one

INT HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES - EVENING

CLOSE on JOHNSON We pull back to find him standing before a
majestic spectacle in the midst of a momentous event a joint
session of Congress Rows of SENATORS and CONGRESSMEN look up
at him as he begins to address the nation before TV CAMERAS

JOHNSON
I speak tonight for the dignity of
man and the destiny of democracy
At times history and fate meet at
a single time in a single place So
it was last week in Selma Alabama

INT BROWN CHAPEL MEETING ROOM - SAME TIME

AMELIA BOYTON and her colleague FREDERICK REESE who stood up
to the Selma Police Chief in the Hotel Albert have abandoned
a planning meeting to watch

JOHNSON (VO)
There long suffering men and women
peacefully protested the denial of
their rights as Americans Rarely
in any time does an issue lay bare
the secret heart of America itself
The issue for equal rights for the
American Negro is that issue

INT NURSING HOME - SAME TIME

ANNIE LEE COOPER the woman that fought back with Sheriff
Clark at the courthouse stops in the patient room she is
cleaning to watch the President’s address on TV

JOHNSON (V0O)
For this issue many of them were
brutally assaulted Should we
defeat every enemy double our
wealth and conquer the stars but
remain unequal in this issue we
have failed as a nation

INT HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES - SAME TIME
Johnson continues earnestly with a serious tone
JOHNSON

There is no Negro problem There is

no Southern problem
(MORE)

JOHNSON (CONTD)
There is no Northern problem There
is only an American problem

He pauses to receive applause from the politicians

EXT FRONT PORCH - SAME TIME

CAGER AND VIOLA LEE sit on the front porch of a ramshackled
plank house in a wooded area They listen to the address on
the RADIO

JOHNSON (VO)
For this problem one good man - a
man of God - has already died And
we met here tonight as Americans -
not white or black Democrat or
Republican - to solve this problem
For to deny a man his hopes because
of his color or race or his
religion or his place of birth is
not only to do injustice it is to
dishonor the dead who have given
their lives for American freedom

Cager closes his eyes at the slight of his grandson and
continues to rock in his chair

INT HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES - SAME TIME

JOHNSON
Many of the issues of civil rights
are very complex very difficult
But about this there can and should
be no argument every American
citizen must have an equal right to
vote There is no reason which can
excuse the denial of that right
Yet the harsh reality is that in
many places in this country men and
women are kept from voting simply
because they are Negroes Every
device of which human ingenuity is
capable has been used to deny this
right

INT POLICE CAR - SAME TIME

SHERIFF JIM CLARK drives in his police cruiser listening to
the RADIO address

JOHNSON (V0O)
The Negro citizen may go to
register only to be told that the
day is wrong or the hour is late
or the official in charge is
absent If he persists and manages
to present himself to a registrar
he be disqualified because he did
not fully spell out his middle name
or because he abbreviated a word on
the application And if he manages
to get past that he is given a
test to which even a college degree
has proven unable to penetrate For
the fact is that the only way to
pass these barriers is to show
white skin

INT HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES - SAME TIME
We are back with Johnson

JOHNSON
The Constitution says that no
person shall be kept from voting
because of his race or color To
correct the denial of this
fundamental right this Wednesday
I will send to Congress a law
designed to eliminate these illegal
barriers

INT WALLACE’S OFFICE - SAME TIME

Wallace stands over the TELEVISION glaring at it He loosens
his tie and then plops down in a chair

JOHNSON (VO)
This bill will strike down voting
restrictions in all elections -
federal state and local This bill
will establish a simple uniform
standard which cannot be used
however ingenious to flout the
Constitution On this issue there
must be no delay no hesitation
and no compromise

INT BASEMENT ROOM - SAME TIME

We see FORMAN and the other more militant-minded activists
watching on TV

JOHNSON (VO)
I recognize that outside this
chamber is the outraged conscience
of a nation What happened in Selma
is part of a far larger movement
It is the effort of the Negro to
secure for themselves the full
blessings of American life

INT HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES - SAME TIME
Johnson has the whole country in the palm of his hand

JOHNSON
Their cause must be our cause too
The time of justice has come and I
believe no force can hold it back

INT JACKSON RESIDENCE - SAME TIME

EVERYONE is there KING is on the couch CORETTA is ina
nearby chair

They all watch Johnson on a TV in the corner of the room As
he speaks we see each of their faces

LEWIS and WILLIAMS who faced an army of ignorance on the
first bridge attempt

BEVEL NASH and ORANGE who pushed for Selma to be the place
of this protest

ABERNATHY YOUNG and VIVIAN the veterans who’ve been with
King at every step for a decade now

JOHNSON (VO)
A century has passed More than one
hundred years since the Negro was
freed And he is not fully free
tonight It was more than one
hundred years ago but the
emancipation is a proclamation and
not a fact The real hero of this
struggle is the American Negro

Then we zero in on KING We watch him as he watches the
President of the United States articulate the pain and
suffering that he has worked tirelessly to amplify

JOHNSON (CONTD)

The American Negro His actions and
his protests His courage to risk
safety and even his life have
awakened the conscience of this
nation His demonstrations have
been designed to call attention to
injustice designed to provoke
change designed to stir reform He
has called upon the nation to
ensure that equality does not
depend on force of arms or tear
gas but on the force of moral
right And we shall do this

(beat)
We shall overcome

A gasp from the room as Johnson utters the movement’s own
rallying call

CLOSE on KING blinking back his emotions as the others stir
with surprise An incredible moment of great weight We watch
him take it in

And then he feels a hand on his arm Coretta

A look passes between them that only they fully understand A
look that communicates what they’ve given up for the greater
good A look of pride -- as he takes her hand in his

EXT EDMUND PETTUS BRIDGE - DAWN

A WHITE PAPER BOY bikes across the bridge with his transistor
radio strapped to his handlebars As he peddles across with
his papers in tow we hear a RADIO ANNOUNCER

RADIO ANNOUNCER
Eaaaarly mornin’ rise and shine
Let’s see It’s March 25 1965

Music” Well I like the sound of
that And the number one song is
this one by a few Negro gals from
Detroit Here you go Time to WAKE
UP

As The Supremes begin to sing “Stop in the Name of Love” the
paper boy pulls over on the side of the bridge to look over
the side in the early morning light

Above the turbulent waters of the Alabama River he sees a US
ARMY BOMB DISPOSAL TEAM combing the underside of the bridge

INT VARIOUS HOMES - THAT MORNING

bus along with other performers bound for Selma

INT BROWN CHAPEL HALLWAY - THAT MORNING

ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL JOHN DOAR is huddled with KING and
YOUNG

DOAR
We have definite verified intel
that there is a sniper strike
confirmed We believe we can cover
you through Lowndes County but
once you have the final day’s walk
through Montgomery passing all
those buildings and what not the
coverage becomes challenging
Please consider driving in on the
final leg And please consider
nixing the speech at the Capitol

KING
If Wallace will see us when we
arrive there will be no need for a
speech Can you arrange that

King and Young exchange an amused look Doar shakes his head
They all know that’s not going to happen

King puts his hand on Doar’s shoulder letting him off the
hook

KING (CONTD)
The fear is always with me But I
ask God to carry it for me There’s
nothing else I can do I can’t
hide You understand

Doar doesn’t but takes a deep breath and nods

EXT EDMUND PETTUS BRIDGE - LATER THAT MORNING

Were looking from the Montgomery side of the Pettus Bridge
It’s empty Nothing moves Then the heads of the front rank
of MARCHERS start to rise over the crest of the bridge

They are led by KING and CORETTA arm-in-arm Alongside are
King’s band of brothers and sisters

The REVERSE ANGLE - in dramatic contrast to the two previous
attempts to cross the bridge - the road before them is open
as far as the eye can see

As they pass under the bridge sign a YOUNGER MARCHER
curiously questions a nearby ELDER MARCHER

YOUNG MARCHER
‘Scuse me You know who Edmund
Pettus is

ELDER MARCHER
Old Confederate general

The Young Marcher nods He figured as much

ELDER MARCHER (CONT’D)
And the first Klan leader ‘round
these parts

YOUNG MARCHER
What

ELDER MARCHER
Called himself the Grand Dragon of
the realm of Alabama

The Young Marcher looks around at the bridge they are on a
bit shocked The Elder Marcher puts his hand on the Young
Marcher’s shoulder

ELDER MARCHER (CONT’D)
Step proud The Grand Dragon’s
definitely turning over in his
grave today

YOUNG MARCHER
Right on

Chuckling together they cross the crest

EXT HIGHWAY - VARIOUS TIMES

- MARCHERS walk in the sunshine Soldiers stand guard along
the route backs to the marchers facing groups of racists

- Heavy rain Marchers wearing ponchos as a few glaring
REDNECKS try to stare them down behind a big-finned car

- MARCHERS mingle round campfires amidst a small canvas city
cooking talking singing

- MARCHERS are silent as they pass through a sinister-looking
swampland An ARMY SNIPER keeps watch in a tall tree

- A dirt-poor shack near the highway Outside the tiny
wooden a VERY POOR BLACK FAMILY stares in uncomprehending
silence as the group passes One MARCHER runs over to them
with some literature to explain what’s going on

EXT OPEN FIELD - LATER

We see MARCHERS sitting in a field cheering In the dark
field we see a solitary light shining on a make-shift stage
made of coffins stacked high And there we watch quick cuts
of entertainers who flew in to support this movement

Illuminated by a single large light we see HARRY BELAFONTE
JOAN BAEZ TONY BENNETT SAMMY DAVIS JR and NINA SIMONE
entertain the marchers

And we see CORETTA SCOTT KING take the stage to CHEERS and
APPLAUSE She looks out into the darkness and feels the
people there then closes her eyes and recites Langston
Hughes’ famous poem “Mother to Son” with delicacy and grace

CORETTA
“Life for me aint been no crystal
stair Its had tacks in it And
splinters And boards torn up And
places with no carpet on the floor-
Bare But all the time Ise been a-
climbin on And reachin landins
And turnin corners And sometimes
goin in the dark Where there
aint been no light So boy dont
you turn back Dont you set down
on the steps Cause you finds its
kinder hard Dont you fall now”

INT WALLACE’S OFFICE - DAY

WALLACE stands with LINGO in his office to one side of the
window mumbling and upset

WALLACE
My God it looks like an army

LINGO
An army of the next voters of
Alabama

What a disaster Wallace shakes his head staring down at

EXT CAPITOL BUILDING - DAY

KING stands proud in the midst of a vast crowd beneath the
Alabama State Capitol with the Alabama and Confederate flags
flying in the breeze

They’re all there with him CORETTA ABERNATHY YOUNG
WILLIAMS BEVEL ORANGE VIVIAN NASH and LEWIS They have
made it to the symbolic finish line

US Army helicopters circle above Federal officers eye King
and everything and everyone around him as he is now under
their protection

JOHN DOAR speaks urgently into his walkie talkie dispatching
direction US MARSHALLS scan the crowd from a high building
with binoculars

On the sidelines are WHITE LOCALS none to happy about the
spectacle They have the right to protest here and they are
exercising it with signs reading “I Hate Niggers” and “Walk
Coon” They wave tiny Confederate flags

In a few moments King will address the massive crowd But
first he looks to Coretta who gives him a firm nod as if to
say “You’ve got this”

King turns and approaches the microphones linked to powerful
loudspeakers that will carry his voice through the thousands
and thousands of people who are gathered before Wallace’s
capitol building

KING
We heard them say we’d never make
it here We heard them say they’d
stop us if it was the last thing
they did We heard them say we
don’t deserve to be here But today
we stand - as Americans We are
here - and “we ain’t gonna let
nobody turn us around”

King pauses as the crowd ERUPTS in passionate approval

KING (CONTD)
This mighty march which will be
counted as one of the greatest
demonstrations of protest and
progress ends here in the capitol
of Alabama for a vital purpose

King’s speech continues in voice-over

MONTAGE SEQUENCE

As King speaks we see the faces of the main players in this
epic saga transform into photographs of their REAL-LIFE
COUNTERPARTS

KING (CONT’D)
A decade ago right here in
Montgomery the Negro community
made a commitment A commitment to
be self-determined To depend on
one another To face our foes with
faith and with unity and with
dignity

KING (CONTD)
We’ve not fought only for the right
to sit where we please and go to
school where we please We do not
only strive here today to vote as
we please But with our commitment
we give birth each day to a new
energy that is stronger than our
strongest opposition We arm
ourselves with a longing for peace
and personhood And we embrace this
new energy so boldly embody it so
fervently that its reflection
illuminates a great darkness

are
(MORE)

KING (CONTD)
From slavery to the
Reconstruction to the precipice at
which we now stand we’ve seen
powerful white men rule the world
offering poor white men a vicious
lie as placation And when the poor
white man’s children wail with a
hunger that cannot be satisfied he
feeds them with that vicious lie A
lie whispering to them that
regardless of their lot in life
they can at least be triumphant in
the knowledge that their whiteness
makes them superior to blackness

We see Sheriff Jim Clark with TEXT ON SCREEN

JIM CLARK - Defeated by overwhelming black vote in the next
election and was never Sheriff again

KING (CONTD)
But we know the truth We know the
truth And we will go forward to
that truth to freedom We will not
be stopped We will march for the
vote we will march for our rights
we will march to demand treatment
as full citizens we will march
until the viciousness and darkness
gives way to the light of
righteousness

We see Governor George Wallace with TEXT ON SCREEN

GEORGE WALLACE - Ran for President four times left paralyzed

by an assassination attempt in 1972 Remained prominent in
Republican politics of the South until his death atage 79

KING (CONTD)

stop this movement We forbid it
For we know it is this darkness
that murders the best of us
Whether Jimmie Lee Jackson or
James Reeb or four blameless
little girls struck down before
they had even begun

We see housewife volunteer Viola Luizzo with TEXT ON SCREEN

tears our freedom will soon be
upon us For truth crushed to

live forever When will we be
free It will soon be upon us
Because you shall reap what you

swift sword His truth is marching
on”
