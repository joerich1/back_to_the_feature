DAVID
(too anxious to laugh)
You remember how a production eats
up ones life

David extends his hand but Whale draws him into a hug

DAVID
By the way I like the Renoir

Whale clears his throat behind the back of his hand

WHALE
When youre through Mr Boone

Clay glances warily at Whale

CLAY

Whale heads off smiling to himself Pleased to be naughty
again

INT WHALES HOUSE - STUDIO - DAY

The room is filled with unframed canvasses many of them
copies of paintings by the Old Masters

position He stares at the blotches of color trying to
remember what he intended to paint

black-and-white plate of The Polish Rider We CUT TO

from the university

The doorbell rings
INT WHALES HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Whale settles into his club chair and opens a book
pretending to read until Hanna ushers in the visitor

HANNA
Mr Kay sir

WHALE
(feigning surprise)
Yes
Whale looks up at EDMUND KAY 22 a slim boy who rests his
weight on one slouched hip his arms twined behind him
There is a look of mild disappointment on Whales face as he
realizes that Kay is a baby poof

WHALE
Ah Mr Kay Id almost forgotten
My guest for tea

Whale stands and holds out his hand

KAY
Mr Whale this is such an honor
Youre one of my favorite all-time
directors I cant believe Im
meeting you

WHALE
(gently teasing)
No I expect you cant

KAY
And this is your house Wow The
house of Frankenstein
(looks around)
I thought youd live in a spooky
old mansion or villa

WHALE
One likes to live simply

KAY
I know Peoples movies arent
their lives

He suddenly growls out an imitation of Boris Karloff

KAY
Love dead Hate living

Kay laughs a high girlish giggle Whale fights a cringe
with a polite smile

KAY
Thats my favorite line in my
favorite movie of yours Bride of
Frankenstein

WHALE

Is it now Hanna I think well
take our tea down by the swimming
pool
Its clear from Hannas frown that she doesnt approve of
the idea Whale ignores her turns back to Kay

WHALE
Will that be good for you Mr Kay

KAY
Sure

WHALE
(opens the back door)
After you then

Whale inspects the boy from behind noticing his wide hips
and plumpish posterior

EXT WHALES HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY

Kays hands flap animatedly as Whale leads him down to the
pool

KAY
I love the great horror films And
yours are the best The Old Dark
House The Invisible Man They
look great and have style And
funny

Whale points to a small shingled house near the pool

WHALE
This is the studio where I paint

KAY

Nice

(refusing to be

sidetracked)
And your lighting and camera
angles Youre got to go back to
German silent movies to find
anything like it

EXT WHALES HOUSE - UPPER PATIO - DAY

Clay Boone gulps some water from the garden hose He
glances down at the pool where Kay and Whale sit in
cast-iron chairs

HANNA
Time for you to leave
Clay turns to Hanna who holds a tray loaded with finger
sandwiches and a pitcher of iced tea

CLAY
Im on my way

She doesnt move until Clay starts off
EXT WHALES HOUSE - POOLSIDE - DAY

Kay flips open his steno pad

WHALE
So Mr Kay What do you want to
know

KAY
Everything Start at the
beginning

WHALE

I was born outside London the only
son of a minister who was a master
at Harrow Grandfather was a
bishop Church ofChurch of
Eng

Whales tongue trips on the word his voice suddenly drowned
out by the blast of a factory whistle We CUT TO

INT FACTORY SHOP FLOOR - DUDLEY - DAY Fiery melt is poured into molds on the shop floor of a
machine parts factory WHALE 16 grips the hot casting
with tongs His father WILLIAM his face blackened with
grime hammers away at the flaws A heavy blow causes young
Whale to drop the mold prompting catcalls and sneers on the
floor There is a look of genuine fear in Whales eyes as
he looks up at his singed beast-like father We CUT TO

EXT WHALES HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY
Kay clears his throat softly

KAY
Mr Whale

Whale smiles politely to cover his momentary disorientation

WHALE
Yes
KAY
Your father was a schoolmaster

WHALE
Of course I attended Eton -- it
wouldnt do for a masters son to
attend where his father taught I
was to go up to Oxford but the war
broke out and I never made it The
Great War you know You hada
Good War but we had a great one

He glances to see if the boy smiles at the quip

WHALE
You cant imagine what life was
like after the Armistice The
twenties in London were one long
bank holiday a break from
everything dour and respectable I
had a knack with pencil and paper
so I was hired to design sets for
stage productions

Hanna comes down the path with the tray She places it on
the table

WHALE
Thank you Hanna Very nice

Hanna remains planted next to the table

WHALE
You can go now

She makes an audible sigh and starts back up the hill

WHALE
There was one play in particular a
beautiful grim study of war called
Journeys End Every experienced
director turned it down so I
offered myself bullying and
begging for the job Journeys
End made the careers of everyone
associated with it It was onlya
matter of time until Hollywood
beckoned

KAY
How much longer before we get to
Frankenstein

WHALE
Am I correct in assuming Mr Kay
that its not me youre interested
in only my horror pictures

KAY
Oh no I want to hear everything
You made twenty pictures in all --

WHALE
Twenty-one The romantic comedies
and dramas were much more to my
liking The horror pictures were
trifles Grand guignol for the
masses

KAY
But its the horror movies youll
be remembered for

An abrupt look of anger flashes across Whales face

WHALE
I am not dead yet Mr Kay

KAY
No I never said you were Or
will be soon

Kay leans over the steno pad determined to be more worthy

KAY
So Journeys End brought you to
Hollywood --

Whale takes in the boys blank bored expression He sighs

WHALE
I have a proposal Mr Kay This
mode of questioning is getting old
dont you think

KAY
I dont mind

WHALE
Lets make it more interesting I
will answer any question you ask
But for each answer you must
remove one article of clothing
Kays mouth pops open

KAY
Thats funny Mr Whale

WHALE
It is isnt it My life as a game
of strip poker Shall we play

KAY
Youre serious

WHALE
Quite

KAY

Then the rumors are true

WHALE
What rumors might those be

KAY
That you were forced to retire
because uh -- a sex scandal
WHALE

A homosexual scandal you mean

For me to answer a question of that
magnitude youll have to remove
both your shoes and your socks

Kay just sits there squinting and grinning

KAY
Youre a dirty old man

Whale tilts his head as if brushing off a compliment Kay
kicks off his penny loafers bends over to remove his socks

WHALE
You are kind to indulge your elders
in their vices As I indulge the
young in theirs

Two pale feet emerge Whale leans forward to examine them
He leans back again

WHALE
No There was no scandal

And he reaches into his coat for a cigar Whales hand
trembles as he slices a hole at the base then lights the
cigar with a wooden match sucking and rotating until the
tip is roundly lit

WHALE
My only other vice I suppose
youd like a fuller answer to your
question

Kay nods

WHALE
It will cost you your sweater

Kay hesitates a moment then sets his pen aside to pull the
sweater over his head revealing a sleeveless T-shirt

KAY
Too warm for a sweater anyway

WHALE
You must understand how Hollywood
was twenty years ago Nobody cared
a tinkers cuss who slept with
whom so long as you kept it out of
the papers Outside of Hollywood
who knows who George Cukor is much
less what he does with those boys
from the malt shops along Santa
Monica

Kay stares at him in disbelief

KAY
George Cukor Who made A Star Is
Born I never guessed

WHALE
Take off your vest and Ill tell
you a story

Kay plucks at his T-shirt glancing toward the house

WHALE
Dont be shy Theres time to stop
before you go too far

KAY
I guess

Kay peels off the shirt and tosses it on his shoes and
sweater
WHALE

George is famous for his Saturday
dinner parties Great artists
writers society folk all rubbing
elbows with Hollywood royalty But
how many of those oh-so-proper
people know about the Sunday
brunches that follow Gatherings
of trade eating leftovers followed
by some strenuous fun and frolic in
the pool

(flicks an ash)
If a goat like that can continue
about his business my more
domestic arrangements couldve
raised very few eyebrows

The revelation seems to have left Kay a little shaken he
flips to a blank page

KAY
Can we talk about the horror movies
now

WHALE

Certainly Mr Kay Is there
anything in particular you want to
know

KAY
Will you tell me everything you
remember about making
Frankenstein

He glances down at his few remaining articles of clothing

KAY
Can that count as one question

WHALE
Of course

KAY
I cant believe Im doing this

Kay stands to unbuckle his belt glancing around the yard
again He unzips and steps out of his sharply creased
flannel legs His thighs are thin and pale

KAY
Just like going swimming isnt it
WHALE
Maybe youd like a swim when were
through I never swim myself so
the pool tends to go to waste

KAY
Okay Frankenstein Tell me
everything

WHALE

Righto Let me see

Whale swallows a wince trying to block the pain pushing
against his skull

WHALE
Universal wanted me for another
story and wanted me so baldly -- I

mean badly not baldly I was
given the pick of stories being
developed and I picked that one

KAY
Who came up with the Monsters
makeup and look

WHALE
My idea Muchly My sketches
Big heavy brow Head flat on top
so they could take out the old
brain and put in the new like
tinned beef

KAY
Hes one of the great images of the
twentieth century As important as
the Mona Lisa

WHALE
You think so Thats very kind --

Whale clutches at the air suddenly notices that his hand is
empty He looks down and sees the cigar on the flagstones

KAY
Boris Karloff Where did you find
him
Whale bends down to retrieve his cigar -- and the change of

gravity drives a spike through his skull

KAY
Karloff Mr Whale How did you
cast him

Whale turns toward the froggy voice

WHALE
Please Excuse me I must go
lie --

He forces himself up with one hand Kay finally looks up
notices Whales colorless lips and desperate eyes

KAY
Mr Whale Are you all right

WHALE
I just need to -- lie down
Studio Daybed in studio

Whale lurches from the table Kay jumps forward catching
him under an arm

KAY
Oh my God Whats wrong Mr

Whale Is it your heart

WHALE
Head Not heart

He leans against Kay who leads him toward the studio

WHALE
Forgive me

EXT WHALES HOUSE - DAY

Hanna runs down the path clutching the front of her apron
in two tight fists

INT WHALES HOUSE - STUDIO - DAY
Hanna swings open the screen door -- and grimaces when she
sees Kay in his BVDs He is kneeling next to Whale who is

stretched out on the daybed

HANNA
Water Glasses at the sink

She goes to Whale scooping different bottles from the
pocket of her apron

HANNA
Which ones I bring them all

WHALE
Luminal

She empties a pill into her palm Whale places it into his
mouth and takes the glass of Water Kay passes over Hannas

shoulder Whale swallows the pill then glances up at Kay
feigning surprise

WHALE
Mr Kay Youre not dressed

Kay frantically crosses his arms over his chest and middle
turns to Hanna

KAY
I was going to take a swim

WHALE
Im sorry I spoiled it for you
You should probably go home

KAY
Right

Kay hurries outside to retrieve his clothes Hanna undoes
Whales bow tie She makes no attempt to be gentle

WHALE
You must think Im terrible Hanna

HANNA
I do not think you anything
anymore Just back from the
hospital and already you are
chasing after boys

WHALE
Oh shut up All we did was talk
My attack had nothing to do with
him

HANNA
Perhaps we should get you uphill
before the pills knock you cold

WHALE
No Let me lie here Thank you

Hanna nods moves to the door Whale closes his eyes
breathes deeply trying to block the throbbing SOUND in his
brain We CUT TO
INT FACTORY SHOP FLOOR - DUDLEY - DAY The noise is deafening -- the clank of chains the screech
of wheels and the endless banging of hammers William Whale
continues to knock away at the hot casting The rhythmic
sound blends into the insistent knocking of

A FIST

which smashes against sheet metal
INT CLAYS TRAILER - DAY

Clay Boones eyes dart open

DWIGHT (0S)

CLAY

A baseball-capped head is visible through the louvered glass
in the trailers door DWIGHT JOAD 30 Clays neighbor
squints to see inside

CLAY

DWIGHT

Clay glances over seems surprised to see a naked back

CLAY

DAISY

CLAY
Huh

DAISY

CLAY
Time to go Daisy

She presses her naked body against Clays

DAISY
You know I could help you fix up
this place real nice

Clay takes a deep breath trying to clear the gumminess from
his brain

CLAY
Dont you have to be somewhere
Like high school maybe

DAISY
I gave it up for Lent

Daisy smiles at her own joke Clay frowns

CLAY
Right
(jumps up from the bed)
Time to hit the road kid

INT WHALES HOUSE - STUDIO - DAY

Whale ponders the half-painted canvas clearly distressed by
his lack of progress The stillness is punctured by the
sound of Clays lawnmower being dragged up the brick steps
Whale smiles puts down his brush

EXT WHALES HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY

Clay stops turns around feeling someones eyes watching
him

WHALE (0S)
(singing)
The bells of hell go ting-a-ling

The mower slips out of Clays hands momentarily he looks
around spots Whale inside the studio

WHALE
Everything alright Mr Boone

CLAY
Just got away from me Sorry to
disturb you

The screen door squeaks open clatters shut A leather
slipper and rubber-tipped cane appear Whale strolls into
view smiling

WHALE
I was just about to ask Hanna to
bring down iced tea Id like it
very much if youd join me

CLAY
stink to high heaven right now

WHALE

The honest sweat of ones brow I
assure you I wont be offended
Let me tell Hanna to bring tea for
two

Whales cane trembles in his skeletal hand His frailty
chips away at Clays resolve

WHALE
Or would you prefer a beer

CLAY
No Iced teas fine

WHALE
Splendid

Clay hoses the crumbs of grass off his arms He dries his
hands and arms with his hat then wads it up and stuffs it
into his shirt to wipe out his armpits

INT WHALES HOUSE - STUDIO - DAY

Clay stands at the screen door

WHALE
Come in Mr Boone

Whale sits on a daybed next to a pile of newspapers He
gestures at a wooden armchair across from him

WHALE
My workshop my studio Hardly
somewhere in which a sweaty workman
should feel out of place

Clay glances at the unframed canvases on the wall and
stacked in the corners

CLAY
These are your paintings

WHALE

What Oh yes
CLAY

Excuse me but -- are you famous
WHALE

You know what they say If you
have to ask --

CLAY
Im just a hick who cuts lawns
But some of these look familiar

WHALE
They were familiar when I painted
them That ones copied from a
Dutch still life done almost three
hundred years ago And thats a
Rembrandt

CLAY
Theyre just copies then Gotcha
WHALE
But before I retired you might say
had a brief time in the sun
Fame as it were Tell me do you
like motion pictures

CLAY

Sure everybody does When I was a
id Id go with my sister twice a

Clay jumps up to open the screen door Hanna walks past

refusing to look at him

She sets the tray on a table very

hard

ringing the glasses and silverware

HANNA
How are you feeling Mr Jimmy
How is your mind today

WHALE
My minds lovely And yours

Hanna flares her nostrils at him

HANNA
You remember what the doctor tells
us

WHALE
Yes yes yes I merely invited
Mr Boone in for a glass of tea
Well have a brief chat and hell
finish the yard

HANNA
I am not forgetting your last brief
chat
WHALE
Just go We can manage without

Hanna stares up at Clay

HANNA
He looks plenty big You wont
need my help if anything goes
flooey

Go

She shakes her head and marches out the door Clay returns
to his chair and sits down again

WHALE
When they stay in your employ too
long servants begin to think
theyre married to you
(smiles at Clay)
Please Mr Boone Help yourself

CLAY
What did she mean by going flooey

WHALE
I returned recently from a stay in
hospital
CLAY
What was wrong
WHALE
Nothing serious A touch of

stroke

Clay nods chugs his tea When he lowers the glass he
finds the old man watching him

WHALE
You must excuse me for staring Mr

Boone But you have a marvelous
head

CLAY
Huh

WHALE
To an artistic eye you understand
Have you ever modeled

CLAY
You mean like posed for pictures

WHALE
Sat for an artist Been sketched

CLAY
(with a laugh)
Whats to sketch

WHALE
You have the most architectural
skull And your nose Very
expressive

CLAY
Broke is more like it

WHALE
But expressively broken How did
it happen

CLAY

Football in college

WHALE
You went to university

CLAY
Just a year I dropped out to join
the Marines

WHALE
Yes You were a Marine

Whales gaze deepens He laughs lightly

WHALE
I apologize for going on like this
Its the Sunday painter in me Of
course I can understand your
refusal Its a great deal to ask
of someone

CLAY
You mean -- you really want to draw
me

WHALE

Indeed Id pay for the privilege
of drawing your head

CLAY
But why

WHALE
Even an amateur artist needs a
subject to inspire him

CLAY
And its just my head you want
Nothing else

WHALE
What are you suggesting Youll
charge extra if I include a hand or
a bit of shoulder

CLAY
You dont want to draw pictures of
me in my birthday suit right

WHALE
I have no interest in your body
Mr Boone I can assure you of
that

Clay takes a moment to size up Whale -- whose innocent
slightly befuddled smile makes him appear about as
threatening as a box of cornflakes

CLAY
All right then Sure I could use
the extra dough

WHALE
Excellent Well have a most
interesting time

Whale lifts his glass takes a small sip of tea
EXT WHALES HOUSE - DAY

Clay fetches a pair of hedge clippers from his truck He
cant help stopping by the side-view mirror to look at his
face

INT EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY
Doctors and technicians flash lights into Whales eyes

test his reflexesinject him with radioactive isotope
Whale sits very still with his head behind a fluoroscope
screen while two doctors murmur over the image
INT DOCTORS OFFICE - DAY

A pair of X rays are slapped wet on a light board Two
skulls one facing forward the other in profile DR
PAYNE a bland young neurologist points to a smudge in the
side-view X ray

DR PAYNE
This is the area of infarction By
which we mean the portion of brain
affected by the stroke

The venetian blinds of the examining room are closed Whale
sits calmly flanneled legs crossed at the knees gazing at
his own skull

DR PAYNE
Youre a lucky man Mr Whale
Whatever damage was done by your
stroke it left your motor
abilities relatively unimpaired

WHALE
Yes yes Dr Payne But from the
neck up Whats my story there

DR PAYNE
Thats what Im trying to explain

Payne turns off the light board and goes to the venetian
blinds The room is instantly full of sun

DR PAYNE
The central nervous system selects
items from a constant storm of
sensations Whatever was killed in
your stroke appears to have
short-circuited this mechanism
Parts of your brain now seem to be
firing at random

WHALE
Youre saying theres an electrical
storm in my head

DR PAYNE
Thats as good a way as any to
describe it Ive seen far worse
cases You might even learn to
enjoy these walks down memory lane
WHALE
But the rest of it The killing
headaches The phantom smells My
inability to close my eyes without
thinking a hundred things at once
Its all nothing more than bad
electricity

DR PAYNE
In a manner of speaking Ive
never encountered the olfactory
hallucinations but Im sure
theyre related

WHALE
So what do I do

DR PAYNE
Take the Luminal to sleep or
whenever you feel an attack coming
on

WHALE
You seem to be saying that this
isnt just a case of resting until
Im better That my condition will
continue to deteriorate until the
end of my life

The doctor responds with a sympathetic gaze Whale nods
solemnly

INT HALLWAY - DAY

Whale makes his way toward the stairs He passes a
stoop-shouldered ELDERLY WOMAN who leans on the arm of her
middle-aged DAUGHTER Then an OLD MAN in a wheelchair his
eyes brimming with bewilderment and despair

INT WHALES HOUSE - FOYER - DAY

Hanna opens the door Clay wears dungarees and a white
dress shirt

CLAY
Dont worry you already paid me

HANNA
The Master is waiting for you
She gestures him in shuts the door
INT WHALES HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
Clay follows Hanna into the kitchen

HANNA

of beer a bottle of Coke

CLAY

INT WHALES HOUSE - STUDIO - DAY
Clay opens the squeaking door and enters behind Hanna
Whale stands at a drafting table sharpening a pencil
Hanna sets the tray down

WHALE
Very good Hanna Now goodbye

She goes toward the door wrinkling her forehead at Clay
The screen door bangs shut

WHALE
Im sure youd like something to
wet your whistle while I work

Whale opens a bottle of beer pours it into a glass hands
it to Clay He gestures to a chair

WHALE
Well go slowly today Since this
is your first time as a model

Clay sits He pulls a TV Guide out of his back pocket

CLAY
Did you see this Theyre showing
one of your movies tomorrow night

WHALE
You dont say Which picture

CLAY
Bride of Frankenstein

WHALE
Hmmm I much prefer Show Boat or
The Invisible Man Shall we

begin
Clay takes a swig of beer and sets the glass on the floor

CLAY
Ready when you are

Whale stares at Clay

WHALE
That shirt Mr Boone

CLAY
Its new
Im sorry Its too white too
distracting Would it be asking
too much for you to take it off

CLAY
Im not wearing an undershirt

WHALE
Pish posh Mr Boone Im not your
Aunt Tilly

CLAY
But its just my face you want to
draw

WHALE
Oh if its going to make you
uncomfortable

(sighs)

Perhaps we can find something else
for you to wear

He lifts a drop cloth off a footlocker revealing a stack
of Physique magazines Whale casually covers them with a
newspaper

WHALE
We could wrap this like a toga
around your shoulders Would that
help you overcome your schoolgirl
shyness

CLAY
All right already Ill take it
off Kind of warm in here anyway

He unbuttons the shirt and pulls it off

WHALE
Yes Much better
(steps forward)
Here

Clay adjusts his belt buckle as Whale hangs the shirt on a
wall peg He moves back to the easel again

WHALE
I think well have you sit slightly
sideways so you can rest one arm
on the back of the chair Yes
Just so
The arm with the tattoo faces the easel Clay smirks

CLAY
Take a picture it lasts longer

WHALE
Thats exactly what I intend to do

A clatter of pencils in the easels tray followed by a
moment of silence Finally a low whistly scratch Clay
concentrates on keeping still focusing on an open window

WHALE
You seem to have no idea how
handsome you are Mr Boone It
has to do with how snugly your face
fits your skull

Clay wipes a thin line of sweat from his waist

WHALE
Would you be more comfortable
barefoot Feel free to remove your
boots and socks

CLAY
No Im fine

WHALE
Its a bit like being at the
doctor isnt it You have to
remain perfectly still while I
examine and scrutinize you

Whale suddenly sniffs as if smelling something He sniffs
several times more but continues to draw

WHALE

(to himself)
Dripping

(to Clay)
Do you ever eat dripping in this
country The fat from roasts and
such congealed in jars Used like
butter on bread

CLAY
Sounds like something you feed the
dog

WHALE

It is Only the poorest families
ever ate it We kept ours ina
crockery jar

CLAY
Your family ate dripping

WHALE
(catching himself)
Of course not As I said only
poor people --

Whale stops He lets out a bitter laugh

WHALE
Im sorry Ive just realized how
terribly ironic it all is

CLAY
What

WHALE
Ive spent most of my life
outrunning my past Now its
flooding all over me

Clay stares out blankly

WHALE
Theres something about the
openness of your face that makes me
want to speak the truth Yes my
family ate dripping Beef dripping
and four to a bed and a privy out
back in the alley Are you also
from the slums Mr Boone

CLAY
We werent rich But we werent
poor either

WHALE
No you were middle class like all
Americans

CLAY

I guess youd say we lived on the
wrong side of the tracks

WHALE
In Dudley there were more sides of
the tracks than any American can
imagine Every Englishman knows
his place And if you forget
theres always someone to remind
you My family had no doubts about
who they were But I was an
aberration in that household a
freak of nature I had imagination
cleverness joy Where did I get
that Certainly not from them

Whales voice has changed becoming more pinched and nasal

WHALE
They took me out of school when I
was fourteen and put me ina
factory They meant no harm They
were like a family of farmers
whove been given a giraffe and
dont know what to do with the
creature except harness him to the
plow

Whale seems completely lost in the past by now

WHALE

Hatred was the only thing that kept
my soul alive in that soul-killing
place And among those men I hated
was my own poor dumb father Who
put me in that hell to begin with

Whale peers out from behind the square of paper He pales
when he sees his father William his face covered with
grime glaring at him from across the room Whale retreats
behind the pad takes a breath

CLAY (0S)
Mr Whale

Relief floods Whales face He looks out smiles at Clay

WHALE
You have to excuse me Mr Boone
Since my stroke I am often
overcome with nostalgia

CLAY
I dont mind Im not crazy about
my old man either

Whale rubs a hand across his eyes and steps into the open

WHALE
Why dont we break for five
minutes You probably want to
stretch your legs

Whale pulls the cover sheet over the pad to hide what hes
drawn so far

DWIGHT (VO)
So you just sat there while this
old limey banged his gums

INT HARRYS BEACHCOMBER - NIGHT

flaming wreckage of a mill

But Hanna isnt amused She unclenches her arms to close
the bathrobe over her throat

HANNA

INT HARRYS BEACHCOMBER - NIGHT

On the tv Dr Pretorius (played by Ernest Thesiger)
delivers a toast with inimitably ripe enunciation To a
new world of gods and monsters Dwight and Harry and
Betty all laugh

BETTY
These old movies are such a hoot
They thought they were being scary
but theyre just funny
CLAY
(defensively)
Maybe its supposed to be funny

BETTY
Funny is funny and scary is scary
You dont mix them

Suddenly the tinny tv soundtrack is drowned out by the voice
of Elvis Presley Kid Saylor bends over the jukebox
wagging his denim butt and tapping a high-top sneaker

CLAY
Hey Some of us are watching a
movie

SAYLOR

Go ahead Free country

Clay jumps from his stool Saylor sees him coming steps
aside

SAYLOR
You want me to turn it down

Clay slams the heel of his hand against Saylors chest The
boy staggers backward Clay grabs the corner of the jukebox
and jerks it from the wall the needle scratches across the

song Saylor holds up both hands in a nervous surrender

SAYLOR
Hey I didnt know Its your
favorite movie Sorry okay

Clay returns to the bar and uprights the stool Saylor
escorts his girl to the door

monster asks Yes I hope so answers Pretorius without
batting an eyelash He offers the Monster a drink then
adds Have a cigar Theyre my only weakness

WHALE

On the tv the Monster groans Love dead Hate living
Whales focus sharpens prompted by the unexpected
discussion of death

The Monster blows up the laboratory and the movie ends
Hanna shivers as she stands

HANNA

furious cat hiss

CLAY

BETTY
It means its too cold to go
swimming And I dont mean the

waving Clay outside with her hand

EXT HARRYS BEACHCOMBER - NIGHT

catches a glimpse of skin in the side slit of her shirttail

He grabs the door handle

the floor then takes a throbbing luminous mass from a
tray

scalp back into place he fastens the conducting clamps
around Whales temples then throws the heavy circuit
breaker Lights throb with bursts of energyloose sparks

panic fills Whales face

HANNA
No I have children grandchildren

long I do not get away much
(sighs)

Poor Mr Jimmy There is much good

in him but he will suffer the

fires of hell Very sad

CLAY
Youre sure of that

HANNA
This is what the priests tell me
His sins of the flesh will keep him
from heaven

CLAY
Sins of the flesh Everybody has
those

HANNA
No His is the worse

(worse)
The unspeakable The deed no man
can name without shame

She loses patience with Clays blank look

HANNA

Men who bugger each other

CLAY
A homo
HANNA
Yes You know
Clay slowly sits up
HANNA

That is why he must go to hell I
do not think it fair But Gods
law is not for us to judge

CLAY
Youre telling me Mr Whale is a
homo

HANNA

You did not know

CLAY
Wellno not really --

HANNA
You and he are not doing things

CLAY
No

HANNA
Good That is what I hope I did
not think you a bugger too I fear
only that you might hurt him if he
tries

CLAY
Im not going to hurt anyone

HANNA
Yes I trust you

Off in the distance a throat loudly trumpets itself clear

HANNA
You must go in Quickly He will
not like to think I have had you in
the kitchen

Clay gets up slowly reluctant to leave the room

INT WHALES HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Whale comes forward as Clay enters offering a hand at the
end of a spindly wrist

WHALE
How are you Mr Boone So glad
you are free for lunch

CLAY
All right I guess

WHALE
I assume you worked up an appetite
with your labor

A hesitant smile from Clay Whale picks a stack of mail off
the table rifles through envelopes

WHALE
Forgive my rudeness At my age
the post is the cream of the day
He returns the stack to the table but holds on to a square
envelope

Do you mind

CLAY
Go ahead

Clay looks off while Whale opens the envelope

WHALE
Hmmm Princess Margaret

He is examining a folded card He rubs a thumb over the
printed lettering

WHALE

Motion Picture Industry
Cordially invitedReception at
the home ofMr George Cukor

His lips smack open in disgust

WHALE
That pushy little -- horning in on
the Queens sister then offering
to share her with the whole damn
raj I live in this country to get
away from this rubbish

He tosses the invitation on the table

WHALE
Is this Davids doing

CLAY
This Davids a friend

WHALE

Yes An old useless friend You
must excuse me Mr Boone This is
a world I finished with long ago

I pay them no mind and expect them
to return the compliment

(a deep breath)
Lunch should be ready Shall we

He holds out an open hand so that Clay can precede him into
the dining room
INT WHALES HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

Hanna sets down two steaming plates of omelettes Whale
hands a glass of red wine to Clay

WHALE
Cheers

They both take a sip of wine

WHALE
Smells lovely Hanna

Hanna nods steals a glance at Clay as she leaves

CLAY
Saw your movie the other night
Watched it with some friends

WHALE
Did you now

CLAY
I liked it We all did

WHALE
Did anyone laugh

CLAY
(covering)
No
WHALE
Pity People are so earnest
nowadays
CLAY

Why Was it supposed to be funny

WHALE

Of course I had to make it
interesting for myself you see A
comedy about death The trick is
not to ruin it for anyone who isnt
in on the joke

(a sip of wine)
But the Monster never receives any
of my gibes He is noble Noble
and misunderstood

Whale gazes pointedly at Clay who eats with his elbows on
the table quickly bolting the hot omelette
Clay looks up

WHALE
In Korea Mr Boone

WHALE
Did you kill anyone

CLAY

WHALE
ts nothing to be ashamed of in
the service of ones country
Thats something to be proud of

CLAY

WHALE
Quite true Hand-to-hand combat is
the true test Did you ever slay

How free is your schedule this

Whale tilts a scrutinizing eye at Clay

INT WHALES HOUSE - PANTRY - DAY (LATER)

Hanna carries the dirty dishes back to the kitchen
INT WHALES HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

Clay starts to bite the tip off a cigar

WHALE
Use this

Whale passes him a gold penknife

WHALE
Just a trim And mine while youre
at it Fingers are a bit stiff
today

CLAY
You ever been married Mr Whale

WHALE
No At least not in the legal
sense

Clay hands a clipped cigar back to Whale

CLAY
So you had a wife

WHALE
Or a husband Depending on which
of us you asked My friend David
He lived here for many years

The other cigar crunches faintly between Clays fingers

WHALE
Does that surprise you

CLAY
No I -- youre a homosexual
WHALE
Oh dear If one must have a
clinical name

CLAY
Im not you know

WHALE
I never thought you were

CLAY
You dont think of me that way do
you

WHALE

What way might that be

CLAY
You know Look at me like -- like
I look at women

WHALE
Dont be ridiculous I know a real

man like you would break my neck if
I so much as laid a hand on him
Besides youre not my type

Clay suddenly laughs Whales smile deepens

WHALE
So we understand each other

CLAY
What you do is no business of mine
Live and let live I say

WHALE
I hope this has nothing to do with
your refusing to sit for me today

CLAY
No I --

Whale continues to smile slyly

WHALE
What are you afraid of Mr Boone
Certainly not a frail old man like
me

Clay has no answer He gives in with a sigh
INT WHALES HOUSE - STUDIO - DAY

Clay sits sideways on the chair again Whale stands at the
easel

CLAY
Can I see what you did so far

WHALE
It will only make you
self-conscious Youll have to
remove your shirt

CLAY
Sorry Not today

WHALE
But we have to match the other
sketch

CLAY

I just feel more comfortable
keeping it on You just said you
didnt want me self-conscious

Whale steps forward

WHALE
Perhaps if we open the shirt and
pull --

Whales hands to in Clays flesh tightens he shrinks
back The hands stop palms raised

WHALE
Oh dear I have made you
nervous
CLAY
Im fine Id just rather keep it
on
WHALE

Suppose we unbutton the top and
pull it down around your shoulders
Two buttons Is that so much to
ask Just two little buttons

Whales thumb and fingers unpluck buttons in midair

CLAY
No Look What you told me at
lunch is still very weird for me
So either you sketch me like I am
or Ill say forget it and go do
your hedges

Whale takes a step back His eyes are locked on Clay
fascinated by his temper

CLAY
I dont mean to be a prick but
thats how I feel

WHALE
Of course I dont want to scare
you off Not before Im finished
with you

Whale glides behind the easel The pencils rattle in the
tray

WHALE
Tell me more about yourself Mr
Boone You have a steady
companion

CLAY
Not at the moment

WHALE
Why not

CLAY
You know how it is You have to
kiss ass just to get a piece of it

WHALE
Very well put

CLAY
The world is just one kiss-ass game
after another A man has to make
up his own life alone

WHALE
Ah A philosopher

CLAY
Thoreau with a lawnmower

WHALE
(smiles)
I like that But take care Mr
Boone Freedom is a drug much
like any other Too much can be a
very bad thing

Clay glances out the window Feigning a merely casual
interest

CLAY
Is that why you and your friend
split up Because you wanted to be
free

WHALE
In away yes I suppose so I
know its why I stopped making
pictures

Whale backs away from the easel and stares at the paper with
a sour frown

WHALE
You might not think it to look at
me now but there was a time when I
was at the very pinnacle of my
profession The horror movies were
behind me Id done Show Boat

Major success Great box office
Now I was to do something
important The Road Back An

indictment of the Great War and
what it did to Germany It was to
be my masterpiece

CLAY
What happened

WHALE
The fucking studio butchered it
It was 1937 Hitlers armies were
already massing -- and still the
New York bankers stood in line to
curry his favor Anything to avoid
losing the German market They cut
away the guts and brought in
another director to add slapstick
The picture laid an egg a great
expensive bomb For which I was
blamed

A shadow passes over Whales eyes He presses two fingers
against his temple
WHALE
After that I went out of fashion
I was no longer able to command
the best projects so I walked
away Why should I spend my time
working in such a dreadful business

CLAY
Do you miss it

WHALE
(dismissive)
Its so far in the past now Over
fifteen years --

Whale stops himself He smiles gently at Clay

WHALE
Making movies was the most
wonderful thing in the world
Working with friends
Entertaining people Yes I
suppose I miss it More so now
that --

Whale reaches into his pocket takes out the bottle of
Luminal

WHALE
I think we all want to feel weve
left our mark on the world Yes
I wish I had done more work

CLAY
Youve done a helluva lot more
than most people

WHALE
Better work

Whale moves across the room to the screen door

WHALE
But I chose freedom David was
still in the thick of it his life
full of anxiety and studio
intrigue I didnt fancy spending
my golden years as merely the
friend The dirty little secret
of a nervous producer
CLAY
How long were you

WHALE
Twenty years Too long We were
like a play whose run outlasted the
casts ability to keep it fresh
So I finally decided to close down
the show

Whale places a pill on his tongue and swallows He fixes
Clay with a pinched smile

WHALE
When all fetters are loosened a
certain hedonism creeps in dont
you think There was a period when
this house was overrun with young
men Some even posed for me
Right where youre sitting now

Clay sits uncomfortably in his chair His face flushes

WHALE
Of course they werent nearly as
bashful No this room was once
filled with bare buttocks And
pricks Hard arrogant pricks --

CLAY
Cut it out

Clay explodes out of his chair knocking over a small side
table

CLAY
Fuck it I cant do this anymore

He looms over Whale whose breathing starts to quicken

CLAY
Isnt it enough you told me youre
a fairy Do you have to rub my
nose in it

WHALE
I assure you Mr Boone I meant
no --

CLAY

From now on Mr Whale I cut your
grass and thats it Understand
Before Whale can respond Clay storms out nearly ripping the
screen door off its hinges Whale sits on the daybed takes
a few quick breaths Suddenly the air is filled with the
sounds of people cavorting in the pool

Whale looks up sees a young man standing outside the screen
door It is now dark outside

YOUNG MAN
Come on Jimmy Watch me dive

Whale offers a melancholy smile

WHALE
I think Ill just rest fora
moment

The man shrugs disappears into the shadows We move
across the room and through the door

EXT WHALES HOUSE - NIGHT

cigar in the other a harmless old uncle watching young men

He glances over sees Clay in plaid bathing trunks sitting
apart from the others He is puffing on a Camel

WHALE
Youre up Mr Boone

Clay ignores him Whale puts down his martini and cigar
picks up a Polaroid camera He moves over to clay

WHALE
The extras are in their places
Now we need the star Wouldnt
you like to get in the pool

CLAY
You first

WHALE
Oh no I never swim

Whale removes Clays cigarette crushes it with his shoe
Behind him the pool is now a pit full of naked shadows
WHALE
Youll have to remove that shirt

Whale touches Clays bare chest Clay grabs hold of his
wrist causing the old man to yelp in pain In the pool
the extras shriek in alarm

Clays hands close tightly around Whales throat

stories

WHALE

Everybody has stories to tell

CLAY
Not me

WHALE
What about your stint in Korea
Im sure it was full of dramatic

episodes

CLAY
I told you I dont like to talk
about that

Whale nods sensing that hes touched a sore spot

WHALE
And the fear you showed at our last
session How did you overcome
that

CLAY
Not fear More like disgust

WHALE
Same difference Mr Boone
Disgust fear of the unknown -- all

part of the great gulf that stands
between us Am I right in assuming
that youve had little experience
with men of my persuasion

CLAY
Theres no people like you in my
crowd

An
WHALE
No teammates in football No
comrades in Korea

CLAY
You must think the whole world is
queer Well its not War sure

WHALE
I was an officer

Clay breaks his pose to turn and look at Whale

CLAY
This was World War I

WHALE
No my dear The Crimean War
What do you think The Great War
You had a Good War while we had --

Whale clears his throat bored by his standard line

WHALE

-- a war without end There were
trenches when I arrived and
trenches when I left two years
later Just like in the movies
Only the movies never get the
stench of them The world reduced
to mud and sandbags and a narrow
strip of rainy sky

(a dry snort)
But we were discussing something
else Oh yes Love in the
trenches

Now hes talking only to himself

WHALE
Barnett Was that his name
Leonard Barnett He came to the
front straight from Harrow And he
looked up to me Unlike the
others he didnt care that I was a
workingman impersonating his
betters How strange to be
admired so blindly I suppose he
loved me But chastely like a
schoolboy

CLAY
Something happened to him

Whale looks up at Clay stares at him

WHALE
I remember one morning in
particular A morning when the sun
came out

EXT TRENCHES - DAY LEONARD BARNETT 19 boyish and handsome peers into a
periscope Whale stands beside him pointing out landmarks
on the bleak landscape

WHALE (VO)
Odd how even there one could have
days when the weather was enough to
make one happy He and I were
standing on the fire step and I
showed him the sights of no-mans
land through the periscope It
was beautiful The barbed wire was
reddish gold the water in the
shell holes green with algae the
sky a clear quattrocento blue And
I stood shoulder to shoulder with a
tall apple-cheeked boy who loved
and trusted me

Whale reaches over and lays his arm across Barnetts
shoulder Barnett smiles timidly at him We CUT TO

INT WHALES HOUSE - STUDIO - DAY
Whale leans forward completely disoriented His eyes fix
on Clay the white eyebrows screwed down until he is able
to recognize the face

WHALE
Dont do this to me again Mr
Boone I absolutely refuse

Whale stands his legs shaky

WHALE
You will not set me on another walk
down memory lane Not this lane
Not today

WHALE
Why do I tell you this I never
told David I never even
remembered it until you got me
going

CLAY
Youre the one who started it

WHALE

Youre very clever Mr Boone You

What a sorry old man youre
thinking What a crazy old poof

(comes closer)
Why are you here What do you want
from me

CLAY
You asked me to model Remember

WHALE
Of course I remember Do you think
Im so senile --

Whale stands over Clay His pale face turns left right
looking at Clay with one cold eye then the other Clay

returns the gaze worried for Whale

CLAY
Mr Whale Are you okay

Whale turns away He yanks out a handkerchief
WHALE
Stupid Very stupid What have I
been thinking

He sits on the daybed and bends over covering both eyes
with the handkerchief

WHALE
Just go Please Why dont you
go

CLAY

I dont get it First you creep me
out with homo shit Then you hit
me with war stories And now
youre upset because I listen

What do you want

WHALE
I want -- I want

His pained eyes focus on Clay and soften

WHALE
I want a glass of water

Clay gets up and goes to the sink

WHALE
A touch of headache

Clay hands him the water

Thank you

Whale sets the glass down and sits with his head lowered
his body folded like a bundle of sticks

WHALE
My apologies I had no business
snapping at you

CLAY
No harm done

WHALE

It was foolishness to attempt this
portrait You cannot force what
will not flow
CLAY
You dont want me to sit for you

Whale shakes his head sadly He gazes up at Clay sees the
disappointment on his face

WHALE
How would you like to come to a
party with me A reception for
Princess Margaret

out at couples strolling up the promenade An operator
interrupts says One dollar for the next three minutes
Clay deposits two quarters before his mother returns
Hes busy Clay

CLAY
Right

The operator comes on again asking for fifty more cents
Clay stares at the quarters in his hand

Clay listens as his mother prattles on until the connection
is broken and the phone goes dead Clay steps out of the

booth takes a deep breath of ocean air

slides his own mask into position moments before the trench
is obliterated by the yellowish smoke We CUT TO

Exactly Cukor was too cheap to
hire music Theres nothing but
chin-wag The cold dreary custard
of English chin-wag

Whale scans the crowd

WHALE
Slim pickings Well its early
yet Perhaps this is a good time
to pay our respects

Clay follows Whale toward a trellis alcove covered in ivy
A handful of people grin at the mismatched couple who stand
in the shade a homely older man in glasses and a pretty
woman in a white dress with polka dots GEORGE CUKOR and
PRINCESS MARGARET

WHALE
Lets get this over with quickly

Whale forgets to remove his hat when he comes forward
Before he can give Cukor their names Princess Margarets

polite smile bursts open in a joyful display of teeth

PRINCESS MARGARET
I had no idea youd be here

She seizes Whales hand in her little white gloves

PRINCESS MARGARET
How are you
WHALE
(taken aback)
Fine Quite fine And Your Royal
Highness

Standing beside him Clay is clearly impressed that Whale
knows a princess

PRINCESS MARGARET
Can we get together while Im in
town I so badly want to sit for
you again

Sit

PRINCESS MARGARET
Ive changed my hair you see
Since our last session Those old
snaps look rather dowdy now

his sunglasses down his nose so she can see his eyes

Oh dear Have I made a blunder

WHALE
Maam the pleasure is all mine James
Whale

PRINCESS MARGARET
(laughs)
I am such a goose I mistook you

Whale attempts to chuckle while he fights a feeling of
humiliation He turns to Cukor for help

WHALE
Hello George James Whale David
Lewiss friend I once made
pictures myself Maam

GEORGE CUKOR

rock in this town without hitting
one of us old movie directors

Whale feels the sting He turns to Clay

Clay steps forward to shake hands

WHALE
My gardener who insisted I bring
him today He so wanted to meet
royalty

Cukors face goes blank with indignation

CLAY
Pleased to meet you

PRINCESS MARGARET

Whale narrows his eyes at Cukor and sharpens his smile

WHALE
Hes never met a princess Only
queens

Cukor puffs out his chest quivers a bulbous lower lip at
Whale

WHALE
George Maam this has been an
honor An occasion to remember for
the rest of my days

He leads Clay away and an American couple promptly crowd in
to take their place Striding through the garden Whale is
obviously pleased with himself

CLAY
What was that about

WHALE
Nothing of importance Just two
old men slapping each other with
lilies Shall we have a drink

Whale leads Clay to a tented bar Across the way David
Lewis has come through the gate with a WOMAN on his arm
People look discreetly not at David but at the woman
lightly veiled in a scarf and sunglasses

CLAY
Whos that
WHALE
David The friend I thought was in
New York
CLAY
No The girl
WHALE

Girl Oh Elizabeth Taylor

Clay watches in amazement as ELIZABETH TAYLOR waves to
someone and pipes out a happy hello She hurriedly unties
her scarf thrusts it at David and runs off on tiptoes to
embrace a woman

CLAY
Is that really her

WHALE
David produced her last picture

David glances around while he slips the scarf into a coat
pocket He sees Whale looking at him He puts on a tight
smile and strolls across the patio

DAVID
What are you doing here

WHALE
Just what I was about to ask you
I thought you were in New York

DAVID
I was until last night Publicity
asked me to fly Miss Taylor in for
todays reception

The waiter arrives with their drinks Only when Clay takes
his glass of beer does David see that Whale is not alone

DAVID
David Lewis

CLAY
Clay Boone
WHALE
Our yardman Who was kind enough
to serve as my escort to Georges
little do

David freezes Whale lifts his martini glass at Clay and
takes a sip

DAVID
Should you be drinking in your
condition

WHALE

Oh David stop being a nanny

Clay clears his throat eager to escape this domestic
squabble

CLAY
I think Ill go look at Elizabeth
Taylor
He hurries off
WHALE

You should have seen Georgies face
when he met Clayton

DAVID
You didnt Jimmy

WHALE
I did But Princess Margaret was a
doll Were all equals in her
eyes As commoners I presume

DAVID
You only embarrass yourself

WHALE
Oh dear Ill never work in this
town again

DAVID
You know what I mean Your
reputation

WHALE

But I have no reputation Im as
free as the air
DAVID
Well the rest of us arent Cant

WHALE
No I never could You must
regret having had the invitation
sent

David is looking over Whales shoulder

DAVID
I didnt ask George to invite you

WHALE
Then who did

DAVID
Jimmy there are people here I need
to speak to Youll be fine on
your own

WHALE
Yes Perfectly

DAVID
All right then Ill come by tomorrow
for breakfast

Whale nods watches David stroll over to the pool and greet
a gaggle of executives Whale drifts toward some deck
chairs at the far end of the croquet lawn He sits takes a
sip of his drink Suddenly a high-pitched giggle pierces
the air

KAY
Mr Whale

Whale looks out to see Edmund Kay his interviewer from
several weeks ago marching across the lawn

WHALE
MrKay

KAY
Bet you thought youd never see me
again I didnt know if youd be
well enough to come to this party

WHALE
You didnt
KAY
Im the one who got you on Mr
Cukors guest list

WHALE
You Mr Kay How do you know
George Cukor

KAY
I interviewed him after I met you

Well assistant to his secretary

WHALE
I commend you If youre going to
pursue poofs go after those who
can do favors for you You waste
everybodys time when you court

dinosaurs

KAY
Dont think that Mr Whale I
love your movies Thats why I
wanted you to come to this So I

could see you with your monsters

WHALE
My monsters

KAY
Dont go away

Whale tries to do just that but finds himself caught in the
chair He is stumbling to his feet when Kay returns with
Elsa Lanchester 55 at his side

ELSA LANCHESTER
Jimmy How are you

WHALE
Elsa

She takes Whales hand with a look of deep concern and
sympathy Kay races off again

ELSA LANCHESTER
I saw Una OConner a few weeks ago
She said youd been under the
weather

WHALE
Oh nothing out of the ordinary
Growing old

ELSA LANCHESTER
Were all getting a bit long in the
tooth

WHALE
But you appear quite fresh my
dear

She swats aside the compliment and gestures at the chair

Kay returns

ELSA LANCHESTER
Please You shouldnt stand on my
account

WHALE
Perfectly all right But if youd
like to sit --

ELSA LANCHESTER
Im fine Jimmy I can only stay a
few minutes

Of course

ELSA LANCHESTER
Whats our pesky friend up to now

accompanied by a stopped gray-haired man with

a long rectangular face and wary heavy-lidded eyes

ELSA LANCHESTER
Is that Boris Our little chum
appears to be arranging a reunion

WHALE
Oh dear

Karloff age 70 comes reluctantly followed by his niece
ALICE a bashful young woman who carried a blanket-wrapped

bundle

ELSA LANCHESTER
Boris darling I didnt know you
were here These public revels are
hardly up your alley

BORIS KARLOFF
I came for the sake of my visiting
niece Alice And Miranda my
great-niece

His huge hand lifts the blanket in Alices arms revealing a
bald infant with enormous blue eyes Karloff gurgles and
coos at the child

ELSA LANCHESTER
And what do you make of our royal
visitant

BORIS KARLOFF
Perfectly charming A real lady

ELSA LANCHESTER
Of course shes a lady What did
you expect A hussy in tennis
shoes

Whale looks up and discovers Clay standing a few feet behind
Karloff He is ogling two bosomy actresses who are
listening intently to the monocled British consul

Whales eyes try to focus Karloff and Clay together his
once and future monsters Kay shouts to a passing
photographer carrying a bulky Speed Graphic

KAY
Hey you With the camera We got
a historical moment here Come get
a picture of it

The man scans the scene for a famous face

KAY
This is Mr James Whale who made
Frankenstein and Bride of
Frankenstein and this is the
Monster and his Bride

Clay looks up when he hears Kay identify Karloff

PHOTOGRAPHER
Oh Karloff Right

Karloff and Elsa drift into position next to Whale The
flash goes off a snap and a crunch of light Whale cringes
in pain

ELSA LANCHESTER
(through clenched teeth)
Dont you just love being famous
Another flash From Whales perspective the bulb resembles
nothing so much as the translucent tube of electrical
current from Dr Frankensteins laboratory Whale
concentrates on his smile as another snap of light stabs his
brain He clutches Elsa Lanchesters hand

ELSA LANCHESTER
Are you all right Jimmy

A sharp nod from Whale The photographer motions to
Karloffs niece

PHOTOGRAPHER
Let me get one with Frankenstein
holding the kid

Alice hands over the baby Karloff gently cradles the
child Whale stands on his left Elsa on his right They
all smile at the baby who gurgles and points up Whale
follows the babys gaze to the sky where a large kite rocks
and strains in a furious electrical storm

The camera flashes once then again

PHOTOGRAPHER
Got it

Whale glances up -- the kite is gone Thunder rumbles as
the group starts to disperse Whale nods to the faces
exchanging good-byes

BORIS KARLOFF
So good to see you again James

He strolls off clucking and cooing at his baby

KAY
Catch you before you go Mr Whale
Ill make sure everybody gets sent
a print

He goes off with the photographer Elsa kisses Whale on the
cheek

ELSA LANCHESTER
Well be in touch Jimmy

WHALE
Good-bye So nice to see you

Finally Whale is alone He staggers to the deck chair and
lowers himself sideways into the lawn chair
CLAY
You okay

Whale gazes up at Clay

WHALE
Tired A bit tired

Clay nods Whale smiles at him

WHALE
Are you enjoying yourself

CLAY
Actually no I feel a little out
of place

WHALE

Neither of us really belongs here

CLAY
Must have been funny for you
Seeing your monsters again

WHALE
Monsters The only monsters
(closes his eyes)
are here

Across the lawn conversation has stopped Birdlike shrieks
come from all directions

CLAY
Oh fuck And we left the top down
You want to run for it

WHALE
Run for what

CLAY
Cant you see Its raining

The rain is only a flickering of air but people are jumping
and shrieking throwing coats over their heads as they dash
toward the house

CLAY
Here

He takes Whale under the arm helps him up and escorts him
to a small tent On the patio everyone shoves and squeezes
to get through the one open door

Whale stares out hypnotized by the deluge From his POV
we see a young man step into the rain Whale squints is
finally able to identify the man as Leonard Barnett

Whales eyes follow Barnett as he emerges onto a new
landscape a scarred and barren battlefield As the storm
continues to rage

CLAY (0S)
Mr Whale

Whale shifts his gaze to Clay He takes a moment to orient
himself

WHALE
Lets get out of this funk hole

CLAY
You dont want to wait it out
Rain should let up soon

WHALE
Were not sugar We wont melt

Whale adjusts the brim of his hat and steps into the
downpour Clay has no choice except to follow They walk
briskly the minute splashes on Whales hat forming a
ghostly aura of spray

INT CAR - DAY

Whale opens the door and climbs in next to Clay The roof
slowly closes over them

CLAY
I better get you home before you
catch your death from pneumonia

WHALE
Catch my death

Clay glances over sees Whale sitting very wet and rigid
staring straight ahead

CLAY
You all right Mr Whale

Whale blinks slowly turns There is a cracked look in his
eyes
WHALE
Jimmy Please Call me Jimmy

Clay smiles starts to back the car out
INT WHALES HOUSE - FOYER - DUSK
The hallway is pitch-dark as Whale and Clay enter

WHALE
Hanna Bring us some towels
Were drenched to the bone

No response

WHALE
Blast her If we soil her holy
floor its her own damn fault

Whale goes squashing down the hall Clay remains just
inside the open door prying off his shoes and peeling off
his socks He follows Whale into

INT WHALES HOUSE - KITCHEN - DUSK
Whale stands over the table with his jaw open

WHALE
I dont believe this

He slides a note to Clay

WHALE
Its not like her

CLAY
(reading)
Just a night out Sounds like she
cant say no to her daughter

WHALE
Certainly you have better things to
do than babysit an old man

CLAY
Good Lets get dry

INT WHALES HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Whale stands just inside the closet buttoning a crisp white

shirt He reaches for a red bow tie closes the closet
door In the mirror Leonard Barnett stands behind him in
uniform Whales eyes twinkle in surprise He drapes the
tie around his collar

WHALE
What do you think

Barnett smiles his approval
INT WHALES HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
Clay opens the bathroom door calls out

CLAY
Mr Whale

No answer He goes to the top of the stairs and calls out

CLAY
Wheres those clothes you promised

Again nothing Rain ticks against the windows Clay goes
down the stairs

INT WHALES HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Whale fiddles with the knot of his tie

WHALE
He trusts me you know

Barnett sits on the edge of the bed now He smiles a bit
sadly

INT WHALES HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

Theres glow coming from the bedroom and the sound of
Whales voice

CLAY
Mr Whale Jimmy

Clay steps slowly toward the door pushes it open He peers
in

INT WHALES HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Whale pulls on a blazer

CLAY
Mr Whale

Whale jumps He slaps a hand over his chest twists around
sees Clay

WHALE
Oh of course Clayton You
finished your shower already

CLAY
Ten minutes ago Didnt you hear
me calling

WHALE
Im afraid not Terribly sorry
(stands)
I believe I promised you some
clothes

Whale crosses to the closet Barnett is nowhere to be seen

WHALE
Youre much wider than I am You
wont want to attempt to get into
my pants

CLAY
No Definitely not

Clay chuckles Whale smiles

WHALE
Very good Clayton

He takes a robe from a hook on the closet door Clay tries
it on but it wont close over the towel

WHALE
I know

Whale opens a drawer takes out a crewneck sweater

WHALE
Absolutely swims on me but should
take care of your upper half

Clay pulls the sweater over his head

WHALE
That only leaves the rest

CLAY
You dont have any baggy shorts
Pajama bottoms
WHALE
Sorry My pajamas are tailored
Would it be too distressing to
continue with the towel No more
immodest than a kilt you know

CLAY
Do I have any other choice

WHALE
Very sporting of you Clayton

Clay notices a framed drawing on the desk

CLAY
Is that --

WHALE
(nods)
The only memento I ever kept My
original sketch for the Monster

He hands the sketch to Clay who stares down at the famous
flat head hooded eyes bolted neck of the Monster

WHALE
Shall we

Clay puts down the sketch starts into the hall Whale
turns back sees Barnett standing by the window Whale
flips off the light and closes the door

INT WHALES HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Clay sits at the kitchen table Whale opens the
refrigerator and brings out two plates wrapped in wax paper
and a bottle of beer for Clay He pours himself a shot of
Scotch from a decanter and sits down

WHALE
After dinner if Hanna isnt back
Can we try a few more sketches

CLAY
I thought youd given up on my
picture

WHALE
Id like to try again If youre
game

CLAY
Why not Give us something to do
while we wait

Clay munches on his sandwich Whale pours himself another
Scotch takes a sip

WHALE
Tell me something Clayton Do
you believe in mercy killing

CLAY
Never gave it much thought

WHALE
Come now Im sure you came across
such situations in Korea A
wounded comrade or perhaps one of
the enemy Someone for whom death
would be a blessing

Clay stops chewing He stares down at his plate

CLAY
I never went

He takes a deep breath looks up at Whale

CLAY
I never made it to Korea

WHALE
But you said --

CLAY
-- that I was a Marine Which is
true You filled in the rest

WHALE
I see

Clay downs his beer refills the glass

CLAY
My old man was a Marine He
enlisted the day he turned
seventeen

The Great War

CLAY
(nods)
By the time he was ready to ship
out the fighting was over He
missed out

WHALE
A very lucky thing indeed

CLAY
Thats not the way he saw it To
him it was like his life never got
started Nothing else really
mattered Definitely not his
family

Whale gazes sympathetically at Clay

CLAY

The morning after Pearl Harbor he
drove down to St Louis to
reenlist He was so damn excited
World War II was going to be his
second chance

(sighs)
They told him he was too oldfat
nearsighted Said hed be more
use to his country if he stayed
home and looked after his family

WHALE
Is that why you joined the Marines
For your fathers sake

CLAY
I figured hed think you know --
it was the next best thing Hey I
loved it too A chance to be a
part of something important
Something bigger than yourself

WHALE
What happened

CLAY
I didnt have the guts for it

A look of surprise crosses Whales face

CLAY
I mean literally My body
screwed me up Burst appendix
They gave me a medical discharge
All I thought about was how am I
going to tell the old man
He breaks into a crooked smile

CLAY
You know what he did when I called
him He laughed He laughed so
hard he practically burst a blood
vessel Said it was a good lesson
for me Not to try to fill his
shoes

Im very sorry

CLAY
Thems the breaks right No war
stories for this pup

WHALE
Thats where youre wrong Clayton
Youve just told one A very good
story indeed

Whale lifts his glass in a toast Clay empties his glass of
beer He motions toward the decanter

CLAY
Do you mind

Not at all
He hands the decanter to Clay
INT WHALES HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Clay sits in a straight-backed chair smoking a cigarette
and sipping his Scotch Whale sketches from a wing chair
across the room

CLAY
Storms getting worse

WHALE
A perfect night for mystery and
horror The air itself is filled
with monsters

CLAY
Thats from your movie right
The only monsters are here
WHALE
I dont remember that one

CLAY
James Whale This afternoon at the
party
Whale looks up
CLAY

I said it must be weird seeing your
monsters again and you said The
only monsters are here I was
wondering which here you meant

WHALE
I dont recall Memories of the
war perhaps

CLAY
But that was so long ago It cant
still bother you

WHALE
Oh but it does Especially in
light of the journey Im about to
make

CLAY
Youre planning a trip

Whales gaze remains dreamy and preoccupied as SOUNDS of
battle fill the room A relentless rat-a-tat of gunfire
The whistling of bombs The tortured wailing of dying men
Whale stands moves over to the window

WHALE
Barnett Barnett on the wire

CLAY
Your friend

Whale gazes out at the storm From his POV we see a
scarred and barren landscape illuminated by occasional
flashes of lightning

WHALE
He caught his one night coming back
from the reconnoiter I wouldnt
take him out but McGill did Just
to give the lad a taste They were
nearly home when a Maxim gun opened
fire

EXT TRENCHES - NIGHT We race along the open trench with Whale the darkened sky
intermittently punctured by bursts of gunfire He reaches
the periscope pulls an enlisted man off it From his POV
we see Barnett and McGill dodging bullets as they attempt to
make their way back

WHALE
(through clenched teeth)
Come on Come on

McGill leaps over the barbed wire of a forward trench
Barnett follows Just as his feet leave the ground his
chest is riddled by a fresh round of gunfire Whales eyes
snap closed trying to obliterate what theyve just seen

WHALE (VO)
Barnetts body fell in wire as
thick as briers It was hanging
there the next morning a hundred
yards from the line too far out
for anyone to fetch it

INT WHALES HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Whale stares out impassively

WHALE
We saw him at morning stand-to and
evening stand-to Good morning

Barnett wed say each day

Hows ole Barnett looking this
morning Seems a little peaky
Looks a little plumper His
wounds faced the other way and his
hat shielded his eyes so one could
imagine he was napping on
bedsprings He hung there until we
were relieved We introduced him
to the new unit before we marched
out speaking highly of his
companionship

Clays eyes are filled with pity

WHALE
Oh but we were a witty lot
Laughing at our dead Telling
ourselves it was our death too

But with each man who died I
thought Better you than me poor
sod

(bitterly)

A whole generation was wiped out by
that war Millions and millions of
young men

Whale begins to hum a tune we have heard before

WHALE
Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling
Grave where thy victory

CLAY
You survived it It cant hurt you
now Its no good to dig it up

WHALE
Oh no my friend Its digging
itself up There is nothing in the
here and now to take my mind off
it All my diversions have
abandoned me Parties Reading
Painting Work Love All gone
to me now

Whale remains perfectly still staring out the window Clay
deliberates a moment then puts down his drink next to the
decanter of Scotch He stands and yanks the neck of the
sweater over his face then tosses it on the sofa Whale
blinks at the reflection in the glass not yet
understanding

CLAY
You wanted to draw me like a Greek
statue All right then

Clay pulls at the knot lets go of the towel He defiantly
parks his hands on his hips

CLAY
There Not so bad

Whale continues to stare at the reflection his back to
Clay his eyes wide and expressionless He turns slowly
fully expecting the vision to evaporate When he sees that
Clay is truly naked he mutters softly under his breath

WHALE
So it is going to happen after all
CLAY
Whatd you say

Whale doesnt respond Finally he opens his mouth to take a
breath

WHALE
No It wont do

CLAY
What wont do

WHALE

You are much too human

CLAY
What did you expect Bronze

WHALE
Dont move

Whale moves abruptly across the room He walks past Clay

INT WHALES HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Whale passes quickly through the dining room and out to the
kitchen

INT WHALES HOUSE - GARAGE - NIGHT
Whale reaches for the hatbox which sits on top of a garbage
can Suddenly a large hand appears on the box Whale gasps

when a flash of lightning reveals the face of the Monster

The Monster growls out an inarticulate greeting He picks
up the box and hands it to Whale

INT WHALES HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Whale removes the lid sets the hatbox on the sofa

WHALE
I would like you to wear this

Whale steps back Clay takes the box and covers his lap
with it He lifts out the gas mask

CLAY
Why
For the artistic effect The
combination of your human body and
that inhuman mask Its quite
striking

CLAY
I dont know

WHALE
Please Clayton Just fora
minute Long enough for me to see
the effect

CLAY
Its from the first World War
isnt it

WHALE
(nods)
There are straps in back

Clay fits the mask on the top of his head and draws it down
The living room turns brownish yellow in the thick glass

goggles

WHALE
Let me help you

Whale is suddenly behind him Clays vision is enclosed in
two round windows so he cant see Whale buckling the second
strap

CLAY
Now what

Mouth muffled by the inhalator Clay hears his voice from
inside his head Whale comes around to stand in front of
him He grins as he steps back to examine Clay Clay
nervously taps his knees with his hands

CLAY
All right Lets take it off now

WHALE
What was that

CLAY
Its too tight

Clay raises his voice to make himself heard He reaches
back to undo the buckles
Allow me
Whale steps in past the goggles

WHALE
We dont want to tear the straps

Clay drops his hands so Whale can undo the buckles But
nothing happens Clay turns left and right

WHALE
Oh yes I am still here

Two hands grip Clays shoulders

WHALE
What steely muscles Clayton

Whales hands squeeze Clay grabs the frame of his seat to
stop his arms from automatically swinging a fist Whales
hand slides over Clays shoulder to his arm caressing the
tattoo Clay jerks his shoulder to shake Whale off

CLAY
Just take off the fucking mask

WHALE
Relax Clayton I cant hear you
I cant hear a word

Whale presses his lips to Clays tattoo Clays muscles
tense from head to toe

WHALE
What a solid brute you are

Whales tongue moves down Clays arm

WHALE
No Maybe this then

The hand slides over Clays stomach toward his lap The
tattooed arm swings backward slamming an elbow against
Whales skull Clay jumps from the chair knocking into an
end table The glass and crystal decanter fall to the
floor The lamp spills over and the room goes dark

Clays ankle is caught by the sofa leg and he hits the
floor jamming the inhalator against his mouth He quickly
gets up on his knees and elbows pulling at the mask
Flashes of lightning strobe the room as Whale collapses over

Clays back and holds on

WHALE
Oh yes I have you now

A strap breaks Clay rips the mask off

CLAY
Get the fuck off

Whales hand squeezes between Clays legs

WHALE
What will you do to get yourself
back

Clay jabs with his elbow flipping Whale on his back His
body straddles Whales and pins him face to face

CLAY
Im not that way Get it through
your fucking head I dont want to
mess with you

WHALE
Oh but you feel good Clayton

His hands clasp Clays hips Clays fist opens as it comes
down he slaps Whale across the face

WHALE
That didnt even sting Youre not
such a real man after all Are
you

Clay whacks Whales face again

WHALE
Wait until I tell my friends I had
you naked in my arms Wont they
be surprised

CLAY
I havent done a damn thing with
you

WHALE

Oh but you have You undressed
for me I kissed you I even
touched your prick How will you
be able to live with yourself
Clay snatches Whales wrist before it can touch his crotch
With his other hand he picks up the heavy crystal decanter

CLAY
What the hell do you want from me

Whale tilts his face up for another blow

WHALE
I want you to kill me

Clay freezes He stares down at the old man with white hair
and wild eyes lying beneath him

WHALE
Break my neck Or strangle me It
would be oh so easy to wrap your
hands around my neck and choke the
life out of me Please Clayton
Weve come this far

CLAY
Youre crazy

Whales eyes glimmer in the sporadic bursts of lightning

WHALE
Exactly Im losing my mind
Every day another piece goes
Soon there will be nothing left
Look at the sketch I made of you

Clay turns to the sketch pad which lies on the floor next
to Whale The page is filled with nothing but doodles and
scrawls

CLAY
Look if you want to die do it
yourself

WHALE
No I dont want to die alone But
to be killed by you -- that would

make death bearable They say you
never see the one with your name on
it But I want to see death coming
at me I want it to be sharp and
hard with a human face Your
face Think Clayton Youd be my
second Monster Almost as famous
as the first It would be the
great adventure youve yearned for
A war story for both of us to
share

Clays breathing comes in quick panicked bursts

WHALE
Youd be fully exonerated Ive
taken care of that I wrote a
note Ill even leave you the
house the car

Clays body starts to tremble

WHALE
Do it now Clayton Make me
invisible
Clay lets out a howl -- his shoulders heave and shake
CLAY

I am not your monster

He climbs off Whale crawls away his body collapsing in
wracking anguished sobs Whale opens his eyes gazes at
Clay

WHALE
What have I done
(sits up)
Oh selfish selfish fool I
have lost my mind

He forces himself to his feet

WHALE
What was I thinking

Whale picks up the towel and moves over to Clay

WHALE
Youre a softhearted bloke A
bloody pussycat

Whale places the towel around Clays shoulders
WHALE
My deepest apologies Can you ever

forgive me

Clay doesnt look up
I suppose not

(a bone-crushing sigh)
Good God I am tired I really
must go to bed

Whale starts slowly down the hall
INT WHALES HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Whale sits on the edge of the bed tugs the bowtie from his
collar Clay taps on the door opens it

CLAY
You okay

WHALE
Oh Clayton

CLAY
Did I hurt you

WHALE

Nothing I didnt deserve

CLAY
Need some help

WHALE
Pray you undo this button

He lifts his chin and points to his collar

WHALE
I can never manage it when Im
tired

Clay leans in to open the button His face is only six
inches from Whales

WHALE
Do you believe people come into our
lives for a reason

Clay doesnt answer Whale turns breaking their shared
gaze

WHALE
I can undress myself thank you

CLAY
(steps back)
All right
Whale hauls his legs up and stretches out on the bed

WHALE
When you diebe sure your brain
is the last organ to fizzle --

CLAY
Youll feel better tomorrow

WHALE
Tomorrow and tomorrow and
tomorrow
Whale smiles fondly at him
WHALE

Goodnight Clayton

Clay pulls the door shut and it clicks He stands there a
moment

INT WHALES HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
Clay shakes open a bedsheet and wraps himself in it
INT WHALES HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Clay finds a pack of cigarettes on the floor and lights one
then sets the furniture back up He picks up the gas mask
from beside the sofa shoves it into its box

Clay sits in the wing-back chair props his feet on the
hassock adjusting the sheet around his shoulders We CUT
TO

INT WHALES HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Whale bolts up in bed An electrical storm flashes and
cracks in the window

Whale gets out of bed stares outside From his POV the
lawn is a barren slope covered with stumps

Whale turns on the desk lamp sits He pulls out a piece
of paper

EXT BATTLEFIELD - NIGHT
Were back to the scene that opened the movie a flat-topped

creature stumbling through the mud A flash of lightning
reveals Clays face He turns signals for Whale to follow
him Whale joins Clay on a slight rise of ground the rim
of a crater Clay points down into it

EXT CRATER - NIGHT
The crater is full of bodies gathered around a pool of
water Whale stumbles down reaches the bottom and bends
over the nearest corpse in khaki It is Leonard Barnett
here are no wounds on his body no rips or gaping holes
His eyes are closed in dreamless sleep

-

Whale looks up and sees that Clay is gone The only other
living creature is an owl which blinks wearily at him

Whale lies down finding a spot next to Barnett He takes a
last breath and closes his eyes We CUT TO

INT WHALES HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

A roar of bells blasts Clay awake The telephone is
ringing A hard pair of shoes thunder out to answer it

HANNA
Hello Oh Mr David

Clay blinks at the sight of Hanna in black dress and white
apron chattering on the phone by the far wall

HANNA
No no he did not tell me But no
problem I will make breakfast

She scoldingly cuts her eyes at Clay

HANNA
Ten Very good then Good-bye

She hangs up and faces Clay with a stern frown

CLAY
Its not what you think

HANNA
I have brought you your clothes
All I ask is that you get dressed
and go We are having a guest for
breakfast

CLAY
I need to talk to you about Mr
Whale
HANNA
There is nothing you can say that
will surprise me

CLAY
Maybe But I still need to talk
Do I have time for a cup of coffee
before I go

HANNA
I blame my daughter for keeping me
out so late I only hope you did
not get him excited It could give
him a new stroke

She stomps into the kitchen Clay gets up slips on his
undershorts Hes zipping up his chinos when she comes out
again with a breakfast tray She hands him a cup of coffee

CLAY
Thanks
(quickly)
Why do you do it

HANNA
What do I do

CLAY
Take care of Mr Whale like he was
your flesh and blood

HANNA
It is my job I did it when he was
happy and it was easy It is only
fair I do it now when he is ill
(picks up the tray)
Enough talk I must wake up the
master

She marches around the corner towards Whales bedroom Clay
hears her knocking on a door

HANNA (0S)
Mr Jimmy Morning Mr Jimmy

Clay pulls on his shirt Hanna comes back around the
corner

HANNA
What have you done with him

CLAY
I put him to bed Hes not there
She goes to the foot of the stairs and shouts

HANNA
Mr Jimmy Mr Jimmy

Hanna starts up the stairs

HANNA
Look for him

Clay reaches for his socks when he notices an envelope on
the floor next to the chair He picks it up On the front
is scrawled the word CLAYTON Clay opens the envelope
Inside is Whales original sketch of the Monsters head He
turns it over There is a message written on the back

CLAY
No

Clay drops the sketch looks out He sees something

Clay leaps headfirst into the water Whale rests lightly on
his back with an upward sway of straight white hair Clay

hauls the body toward the side

CLAY
Almost there Almost there

He gets an arm around Whales chest and heaves the body over
the curb he climbs out drags the body forward to rest in
the grass He grabs the wrist Nothing

CLAY
Son of a bitch You crazy son of a
bitch

Clay straddles Whales thighs and applies pressure on his
rib cage But its no use Clay sits up and takes a deep

breath

HANNA
Ohhh

Hanna comes down the path her run slowing to a walk She
stares at Clay

CLAY
I didnt do it This wasnt me

HANNA
Oh Mr Jimmy

CLAY
He wanted me to kill him but I
didnt He did it himself

HANNA
He says here good-bye I find it
in his room He is sorry he says
He has had a wonderful life

She waves a folded piece of paper

HANNA
You poor foolish man You
couldnt wait for God to take you
in his time

Clay slowly stands up Hanna looks around in panic

HANNA
You must leave You were not here
this morning

CLAY
But I didnt do this

HANNA
The police will not know that
They will want to investigate

CLAY
We have his note

HANNA
Do you want to be questioned about
you and Mr Jimmy Please
Clayton It will be better if I
find the body alone

CLAY
But howre you going to explain
this
(points at the body)
How did you get him out of the
pool
HANNA
You are right Yes We must put
him back

They both hesitate looking down at Whale Then Clay drags
the body parallel with the pool Hanna stoops over to
adjust the collar of Whales shirt

HANNA
Poor Mr Jimmy We do not mean
disrespect You will keep better
in water

She nods to Clay He rolls the body over and it splashes on
its belly It bounces a moment in the waves of the splash
then begins to sink As it drops the air in the chest
slowly flips the body around

Looking up at them with open eyes Whale sinks backward into
the thickening light His arms trail upward and the hands
lightly flutter as if waving good-bye The melancholy sound
of a solo violin pierces the silence as we CUT TO

EXTINT BLIND MANS HUT - NIGHT

A black-and-white scene from Bride of Frankenstein The
old BLIND MAN plays a mournful lullaby on his violin while
the MONSTER listens outside moved by the music He smashes
open the door of the hut in an effort to get closer to the
soul-soothing sound The blind man stops playing looks up

BLIND MAN
Who is it Youre welcome my
friend whoever you are

The Monster attempts to communicate manages only a
plaintive moan The blind man stands

BLIND MAN
I cannot see you I cannot see
anything You must please excuse
me But I am blind

The Monster holds out his burned hands
BLIND MAN
Come in my poor friend No one
will hurt you here If youre in

trouble perhaps I can help you

The old man touches the Monster who recoils with a
defensive growl

BLIND MAN
Can you not speak Its strange
Perhaps youre afflicted too I
cannot see and you cannot speak

INT SUBURBAN HOUSE - NIGHT MICHAEL BOONE 10 lies on the living room carpet staring
raptly at the movie playing on the large Zenith console
The house is small but tidy and comfortable

BLIND MAN (0S)
Its been a long time since any
human being came into this hut I
shall look after you And you will
comfort me

On the tv screen the old man starts to cry then collapses
onto the Monsters chest A thick tear rolls down the
Monsters cheek

Clay Boone sits on the sofa a baby on his lap Hes 40
now his hair starting to thin but still closely cropped at
the top and sides

On the tv daylight fills the hut The blind man and the
Monster share a meal

BLIND MAN
We are friends you and lI
Friends

MONSTER
Friends

BLIND MAN

Before you came I was all alone
It is bad to be alone

MONSTER
Alone bad Friend good

He takes the old mans hand

MONSTER

The blind man nods On the sofa Clay watches his son watch
the movie

Time for bed sport

Michael groans slowly stands

CLAY

Michael glances skeptically at his father

MICHAEL

son

block letters TO CLAYTON BOONE -- FRIEND

Clay nods At the same time his wife DANA appears in the
doorway A pretty cheerful woman in her mid-30s

DANA
The trash Clay Before it rains

CLAY

Okay

Clay kisses the top of his sons head
CLAY
Off to bed

EXT CLAYS HOUSE - NIGHT

Clay carries a large metal bin down the tidy lawn The sky
momentarily brightens with a silent flash of lightning

Clay gazes up at the electrical storm He glances back at
his house sees Dana cradling the baby in an upstairs
window

The skies open with a shattering crash of thunder Clay
tilts up his face drinks in the cool rain Then he extends
his arms and staggers along the sidewalk imitating the
Monsters famous lurch

We PULL BACK revealing a sleepy neighborhood of small
houses and neat lawns until Clay is only a small dot in the
landscape

FADE OUT
