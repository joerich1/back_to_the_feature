that you would be giving free

A typical aluminum sidings salesman in his early 40s
He leans into the microphone

MURRAY
Free storm windows

Yes That you would provide a

intention of giving away the storm
windows

ANGLE ON BB AND MOE

MURRAY (0S)

The storm windows as I can recall
was not an issue I mentioned

that I thought the storm windows
would cut down on their heating
bill and that they would obviously
enhance the look of the house with
the aluminum siding work we were
going to do

MASTERS (0S)
So you werent dangling a free
set of storm windows as a come-on
to selling them the aluminum siding
job Because it says here and
Im reading from a statement from
Mr Tabaleri

What do ya make of all this

INT TOBACCO WAREHOUSE - DAY

The Home Improvement Commission is in session Tilley
and Sam sit at the defense table Masters presides over
the commission table where four or five other commis-
sioners sit

MASTERS

(into microphone

to Tilley and Sam)
Didnt you approach Mr Boloshevski
August 18 1961 while he was
cutting his front lawn and tell
him that his house had been
selected as one of only 16 homes
in the state of Maryland for a
free aluminum siding job

TILLEY
Whats the name again

MASTERS
Boloshevski

TILLEY
Doesnt ring a bell
(to Sam)
Sam does it ring a bell to you

SAM
(leans into microphone)
It doesnt ring a bell to me either
sir

MASTERS
Didnt you suggest that for a
nominal labor charge he would
receive over five thousand dollars
worth of aluminum siding
( )

TILLEY
Thats an awful lot for nothing
Doesnt sound like good business
to me

MASTERS
Mr Boloshevski was ultimately
charged twenty-four hundred
dollars for labor which according
to our figures is about the average
cost of an aluminum siding job

SAM
(leans into the
microphone)
I dont get the point of this

MASTERS
Twenty-four hundred dollars that
you charged for labor is the same
as if Mr Boloshevski had purchased
the aluminum siding and had the
labor done

TILLEY
Maybe Im missing the point here
but if he paid twenty-four hundred
which is the cost of the job I
cant see anything wrong with that
I dont know the guy but I dont
quite get the problem

MASTERS
What were getting at here what
were trying to stress is that
the job was sold under false
terms The man didnt win any
award he was not getting
aluminum siding at a special price
A clear case of deception was
involved here

TILLEY
(to Sam)
Whats he talking about The man
got the job for twenty-four hundred
dollars and thats what it costs
in aluminum siding
(MORE )

( ) 125

TILLEY (CONTD)

(leans into

microphone)
Um I dont know we have no
recollection of this particular
job but I dont know if this is
deception Look if you work ina
clothing store some guy tries on
a suit it looks like shit but
you tell him it looks wonderful
The guys standing there looking
like a sack of shit the salesman
says what a great suit and the man
buys it Thats deception as far
as I can see but I dont
understand the deceptiveness that
you say were responsible for
if I make myself clear

SAM
(leaning into
the microphone)
Id go along with that as well

MASTERS
What were trying to establish
are the principles that have been
laid down as part of the Home
Improvement code of ethics
that you cannot mislead someone
intentionally and I think thats
the principle that applies to this

TILLEY

Did somebody put a gun to this
guys head and make him spend
twenty-four hundred dollars I
dont get the point here I
dont know the specifics of this
case not being privy to all the
information but all I can say is
this guy got a fair price for a
fair job

Another commissioner BUD DELANEY takes the microphone

DELANEY
(to Tilley)
Do you know Mr and Mrs Rayburn
of 156 Aberdeen Avenue Essex

( ) 125

TILLEY
(looks to Sam
and shrugs his
shoulders then
into mike)
I think youd have to familiarize
me

DELANEY

The couple purchased twenty-eight
hundred dollars worth of aluminum
siding and the two of you were the
salesmen on record They say and
I quote here that they would
have received one hundred and
fifty dollars per home for every
person in the neighborhood who
saw their house and decided to
buy aluminum siding

(looking up from

paper)
Is that true

TILLEY
It sounds right

DELANEY

Are you aware that according to
the Home Improvement code you
are not allowed to exceed a
twenty dollar limit in
incentives

TILLEY

(shrugs his shoulders)
We wanted to be a little more
generous thats all

DELANEY
The couple said that they never
did receive any money from any
other jobs as you had promised

SAM

(leaning into

microphone)
We didnt get any leads from them
Their house was not the showplace
that we thought it would be It
didnt generate the activity that
we had hoped

( ) 125

TILLEY
(interrupting)
But should a referral turn up in
the community wed be more than
happy to give them twenty dollars
instead of the hundred and fifty

MASTERS
(leaning into
microphone)
Excuse us for one moment

He then leans over to Delaney and they start to confer
Tilley and Sam watch wondering whats going on Masters
leans in the other direction holding his hand over the
microphone and he talks to the other commissioners

They nod in approval then Masters leans back into the
microphone

MASTERS
Thank you very much gentlemen
Should there be a reason in the
future to call you back we would
like to reserve that right

TILLEY
(leans into
microphone)
Glad we could be of some service

MASTERS
(into microphone)
Are you aware that thats a
violation of sections 258 and
261

( )

Im not
numbers

TILLEY
aware of the section
- Sometimes you get a

little overzealous in the heat of
the sales pitch thats all

BB is watching the proceedings CAMERA HOLDS ON him

MASTERS (0S)

Was it the heat of the sales pitch
on February 23rd of this year that
made you write across a contract
This Job Is Free

ON TILLEY

who is falling apart

TILLEY

As I remember no sale was made
concerning those customers

It fell

MASTERS
out because a loan couldnt

be arranged but the people did
agree in principle

(beat)

The point that wed like to stress

is that

you misled these people

Told them the job was free Then

you sen
cover s

t in your closer with some
tory about how you had

suffered a nervous breakdown and
a sale was ultimately made for

twenty-

three hundred and seventy-

seven dollars That is misleading
and deceptive sales practice

It was

TILLEY

temporary insanity I

dont know it just came over me
it might have been something

I ate
crazy

I dont know it was

Im the first to admit it

was a crazy thing to do Believe

me

( )

ON BB 147

MASTERS

(cutting him off)
We have other specific examples of
deceptive sales practices on your
behalf concerning a job carried
out on December 11 1962 You
violated sections 241 and 247
And concerning a job sold to Mr
and Mrs DeFranco on October 9
1962 violations of sections 251
and 257 took place

TILLEY
What are all these numbers here
Im not familiar with all these
section violations

who is watching the proceedings intently

MASTERS (0S)
It is the feeling of this commission
that these infractions are severe
violations of the Home Improvement
Laws and therefore constitute
misuse of the license to sell
aluminum siding as approved by this
state

CAMERA ON MASTERS

MASTERS
It is the decision of this
commission to revoke your license
to sell aluminum siding

CAMERA ON TILLEY

Hes not very happy

MASTERS (0S)
Which will prohibit you from
practicing in the state of
Maryland

TILLEY
Are you sure Maybe the guys
want to think this over
