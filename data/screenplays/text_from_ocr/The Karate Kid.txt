Words lose their meaning Eyes do the talking Slowly
their heads close the inch gap between them until their
lips meet torrid yet tender intimate yet innocent
The heat rises

ALI
Want to go outside

DANIEL
Sure

Still face to face they try to walk laughing at the
awkwardness of their position Ali gets turned around
Daniel opens the curtain enough to see POV BOTH
Twenty yards off in the crowd a giant chicken flops
around with a basket of eggs The chickens eyes fix
on the shower He removes an egg from his basket and
begins to run toward them clucking and flapping

DANIEL
Oh no

An egg comes out the top of the shower and splatters on
Daniels head Ali laughs at the sight Outside the
chicken crows Daniel forces a smile as the egg drops
down his forehead

Daniels brush stops in midstroke

Back to the wall dangerous-looking even with his eyes
closed the sensei JOHN KREESE kneels facing his
students As Daniel watches with rapt attention
Kreeses eyelids rise His eyes cold piercing seem
to be looking right through Daniel They send a shiver
up his spine

and rises No one moves The air is solemn with si-
lence

sweeps the line of students from left to right fixing
each one with his intense dangerous eyes Tension
crackles in the air Finally Kreeses voice breaks

A black belt springs from his knees His feet hit the
floor with a solid thump His clenched fists are
riveted in front of him

The black belt snaps heels and arms together smartly
coming to attention He bows crisply from the waist
Kreese bows back and steps aside as the black belt
sprints to take his place

meet Daniels above the heads of the still kneeling
class

begins to throw frontkicks into the waves to his own cadence
A wave hits hard DANIEL weaves unsteadily until the undertow
pulls him down He struggles to regain his footing finally
succeeding and resumes kicking until another wave wips him out
When he stands again he looks down the beach to where MIYAGI
is left standing on the last piling calmly balancedon his left
leg A wave looms towards him but just as it breaks the old
man leaps over it He fires a kick with his left leg and
lands perfectly balanced on the piling in the same position as

bamboo staves attached by springs sticking out at odd
angles He rights the contraption opposite Daniel

raps him on the head stunning him Miyagi laughs
hysterically

Daniel rubs his head scowling He sets and punches
again firing a head block almost simultaneously with
the punch This time however a side pole swings out
catching Daniel square in the ribs knocking the wind
out of him Miyagi nearly collapses in gales of
laughter Pissed off Daniel punches again only to be
hit by a pole from the opposite Side Miyagi laughs so
hard he chokes
