The Church of St Peter Los Angeles

June 1991

WHOEVER YOU SEE
Thats a notice

wall Heres another notice NO SMOKING Everyone is
ing This is an AA meeting Theres a lot of Faces to
at I dont know when well get to the one thats talking
but when we do its like this Eyes like glue 50 year
with a face the color of a snuff-users hanky He says this

BENNY

after my third recovery my wife made

me swear Id never bring

another bottle

into the house And I never did I bur-
ied it under the lawn Cut out a turf and
stood it upright with a piece of tin-
foil instead of a cork So here we are

out in the yard and she

s happy because

Im getting healthy in a pair of swim-

ing shorts and no way near

no booze She

decides to prune the roses Meanwhile
Im laying there with a straw stuck in-

to the fucken lawn doing

a quart of red

Curious thing about drunks Their disease often amuses

Thats how crazy I was -

I was sick for

half a life till I finally found my san-

ity again in these rooms

Dont take that

drink - And for the one or two new faces

I see here I say this j

ust do it by the

day You gotta do it by the day - Dont
take that drink And keep coming to these
meetings Because here is where it works

HERE â€”

them
CHAIR
Thank you Benny We have a few more
minutes Anyone else like to share

Ash into an ashtray and now a face Hes around 40 years old
Intense eyes and dark hair Probably good looking when the ang-
les right But this is a bad angle His name is JOHN BERLIN

BERLIN

My names John and Im an alcoholic
ALL

Hi John
BERLIN

I didnt intend to speak today Matter of
fact I wasnt gonna come to the meeting
But I wanna say a couple of things I hope
may be of use particularly as Benny says
to the new faces here I first came into
this fellowship ten months ago I came to

a meeting I was convinced was gonna be my
last - how could a buncha drunks help me -
Then someone got up I think it was Micky
and described himself as the shit around
which the universe revolved I dont know
if that was original to him - it doesnt
matter it was the first time Id heard it
and I still cant think of a better way to
describe how I felt - We all have our own
place in the darkness and I was in such a
mess I could hardly fucken see - Id lost
someone very dear to me - she hadnt died -
I had - I dont know whether she left coza
the drinking or whether I drank coz I knew
she was gonna leave - either way the booze
won - I replaced her with alcohol and anger -
I was angry with her myself everyone and
everything - Where I was I wanted to be
someplace else - any place but here - any
moment but now - But here I am and it is
now and theres a big change about to hap-
pen in my life - and Im going for it coz
this time I know Im not running away - Im
actually two miles into a 600 mile journey
and I feel good about myself going there -
So I stopped off to share that with you -
and to thank everyone of you and everyone
in this fellowship for letting me walk out
of here free

2 EXT OAKLAND BRIDGE SAN FRANCISCO BAY DUSK
High above the Golden Gate Too high for specifics But there
is something down there of interest to the Camera Descending
with the Music it seems to isolate a particular car Too many
and too distant to know which it is But the Camera is follow-
ing and already a mile up the 101 Interstate travelling north

Maybe via a dissolve And maybe not But red and white either
way as the headlights are coming on The Camera is closing on
the highway And a car has definitely been selected There is
nothing much of interest about it Its a blue Mercedes sedan

Mussorgsky will choreograph the pace of these cuts The first
puts the frame directly in front of the car In a few moments
its brights snap up And Titles continue in a dazzle of light

3 INT MERCEDES SEDAN 101 DUSK

Nobody in the car except BERLIN And a lot of cigarette smoke
Just time to wedge in a POV Theres an intersection coming
up He hits the indicators and crosses lanes winding his wind-
ow down Takes a last hit at his cigarette and exits the butt

4 EXT FREEWAY INTERSECTION DUSK

An instant of red as the cigarette shatters up the highway A
heavy sky of red and black cloud The Mercedes turns off head-
ing east This time the Camera doesnt follow Remains static
over the intersection until the tail lights finally disappear

5 INT LIVING ROOM HOUSE DAWN

Bare wooden boards and the sound of singing birds This house
hasnt been lived in for years No furniture other than a new
mattress in the middle of the floor Still in polythene wraps

BERLIN just about awake on top of it Ten seconds of disorien-
tation while he puts this together A stone fireplace Stairs

leading to whats got to be a tiny room above With enough ef-
fort this place could be charming But right now its a wreck

6 INT KITCHEN HOUSE DAWN

This kitchen was out of date by 1963 A huge china sink and a
fat fridge But the cooker works and a battered old kettle is
already on the gas T-shirt and instant coffee BERLIN checks
cupboards out Crockery includes a cup and thatll do for now

His lips articulate a silent expletive The gas has just gone
out Tries to relight it without success On hands and knees he
explores a rubber supply pipe that snakes under the back door
7 EXT OPEN END GARAGE AND YARD HOUSE DAWN

In the garage he finds the gas cylinder Empty and so is the
bastard with it He drags fingers through hair in frustration
Looks around at the heaps of crap that need clearing out The
view beyond he hardly cares to look at But if he does it is
as follows Clouds massing on the horizon Fields getting re-
ady for rain His nearest neighbor is around 200 yards away
His nearest Cow about 50 This house is remote and rural look-
ing with a veranda out back But BERLIN has no inclination for
sight-seeing As he walks away a dreary female Voice seeps in

8 INT LIVING ROOMKITCHEN HOUSE DAWN

The Voice comes via a police scanner Most of this dialogues
bullshit Illegally parked autos and a few drunks still about
BERLIN sits on the mattress eating a breakfast of chewing gum
and milk He unwraps another Juicy Fruit and regrets it Goes
round his mouth like a shoe in a washing machine A reluctant
decision is taken Spits gum at the sink as he arrives in the
itchen Starts unloading his leather bag A flotsam of stuff
is excavated including a 9mm Beretta and a pack of cigarettes

He lights up and takes a cruel hit full of nicotine and guilt
Wouldnt need a clairvoyant to realize hes trying to give up
Something on the scanner interests him and he wanders back to
the living room Theres a call going out for David 72 Sam 3
David 72 acknowledges and BERLIN clearly recognizes the voice

We have a 927D Springfield Street City Dump But David 72
is already hired Im outside Emersons I wanna be the first
horrible face of her day BERLIN exhales through a smile The
Controller needs an ETA for the 927 David 72 doesnt know
Advises her to roll a couple of cars and Secure the location

9 EXT HILLSIDE SPRINGFIELD STREET EUREKA DAY

A Chevrolet zig-zags up a shabby canyon Its the road to the
city dump Its final bend reveals a line of bellowing garbage
trucks Everything is backed up Nothing moves except the car
The cause of the hold-up is explained at the top A Sheriffs
car blocks the road A Uniform moves to wave the Chevrolet in

10 EXT ENTRANCETRACKINFILL CITY DUMP EUREKA DAY

The car parks at a weigh-house and a man in his 50s gets out
Looks like he hasnt slept in a while And got the mood to go
with it Sports jacket and cowboy boots A lot of laugh lines
around the eyes But you wouldnt want to get arrested by him
And especially not this morning His name is FREDERICK T ROSS

TRAVIS

You can drive down there Sir

ROSS
Im already walking Where is it

One of those walking with him is a 10-year-old Kid with a Dog
TRAVIS looks almost too young to own his struggling moustache

TRAVIS
On the infill The guy from
LAs just gone down there

ROSS
He has Whats he doing here

TRAVIS
He was waiting for you Sir Wait-
ed a good while Said hed go down
and take a look I hope thats OK

The track sinks through a valley of a million discarded tires

ROSS
Damn A its OK With a bit of
luck Im goin home What we got

TRAVIS
A derelict

TRIMBLE
They cut his throat

The information comes from freckles and a missing front tooth

ROSS
Who are you

TRIMBLE
Trimble

He wears glasses and wields a rusty 22 pump-action Remington

ROSS
Where do you fit in Trimble

TRAVIS
His fathers the manager Sir
The kid was up there shooting
vermin and he found the body

TRIMBLE
Get ready for it coz Im tell-
ing ya youre in for a shock
TRIMBLE speaks with some enthusiasm ROSS looks back with none

They slit him from ear to ear
Ya want me to make a statement

ROSS
Not right now No Thank you

11 EXT WORKING FACE INFILL GARBAGE DUMP DAY

A series of terraces have been created as the canyon fills up
Black smoke drifts from a distance at will of the wind Gulls
and bulldozers Plus a stinking ten foot cliff of human filth

Several cars parked here including the blue Mercedes Several
On Lookers behind yellow police tape ROSS negotiates it look-
ing pissed off Looks up and somewhere in the smoke is BERLIN

ROSS
Did you bring it with you

BERLIN
I hope Im not intruding

ROSS
Be my guest What you got

BERLIN
Old guy offed himself with a
knife I cant find the knife

And the next thing ROSS is looking at is a death in the trash
A massive dozer in the background Everything else is garbage

TRIMBLE
They cut his throat

ROSS
Would you get outside the tape
And tell your dad to put that
fire out that aint legal

Another face here is so familiar ROSS hasnt bothered to ackn-
owledge it BLATTIS is a 32 year old local newspaper reporter
Little is visible of the body except a blood-stained raincoat

TRAVIS
I wonder what would make
him do a thing like that
ROSS
Dont annoy me Travis

TRAVIS
No Sir

Truck horns wail in the distance On the horizon its thunder

ROSS
So wheres the knife

BERLIN wears surgical gloves Removes film from a small camera

BERLIN
I dunno Guess the dozer
musta shifted him You need
some hands up here to look

ROSS
You heard Look for the knife

Swatting smoke ROSS directs anger at a fat cop called VENABLES
You too Move that ass

BERLIN hands the film to ROSS as he gets into identical gloves
You done the pockets

BERLIN
No Sir I havent started
till Monday Ima tourist

ROSS
Welcome to Eureka

By now ROSS is crouched next to the Corpse examining the wound
How longs he been feeling like this

BERLIN
Week or two Musta been on the ker-
osene Stinks like a diesel engine

BLATTIS
Fucken noddles hanging off

ROSS
Mr Blattis of our local news-
paper You sure its a suicide

BERLIN
Uh huh Hes well rehearsed

BLATTIS
What does that mean Sergeant

BERLIN
Cut your own throat youre ner-
vous about it tend to hesitate
Hes got three trial cuts lower
left side of the neck before he
works up courage for the big one

BLATTIS looks vaguely impressed ROSS begins searching pockets

BLATTIS
You think Popeye would know that

ROSS
I dont think Popeye would be here

VENABLES (VO)

ROSS

les is the coroner called

BERLIN
So what happened to the
barbecues and fishing

ROSS
Watch my lips coz youre not

He finds keys and change and a sandwich in the Winos raincoat

How does anyone dead

TRAVIS

12 EXT INFILL GARBAGE DUMP DAY

ROSS crouches in garbage Peers into a trash sack with assist-
ance of a flashlight Youre right Its a fucken hand Pas-
ses the light to BERLIN His turn to examine the ruptured bag

BERLIN

14 EXT CAR PARK POLICE STATION CITY OF EUREKA DAY

The Mercedes descends an incline and parks Brown Chevys and
black and white patrol cars Dismal lights and raining like it
doesnt end BERLIN gets out and unloads the trunk (aquarium
and insulated picnic box) Slams the trunk and reveals BLATTIS

BLATTIS
You want some umbrella

Proffers a big yellow one plus assistance carrying equipment

BERLIN
Is this normal

BLATTIS
Average rainfall 48 inches
Pisses down October to June

Raining hard enough to hurt A brisk intimacy across the lot

Better in the summer You

He hits a security code at the door Obviously familiar with
the station Dialogue continues as they step into a corridor

15 INT CORRIDORADMINISTRATION POLICE STATION DAY

BLATTIS BERLIN

more So how long you known Freddy

BERLIN
Freddy Forever - he was my serg-
eant when I was a kid - dont get
to see a lot of each other - but
we been buddies two hundred years

BLATTIS
Did he get you the job
BERLIN
I think he would have if he could
have - been trying to get me up
here long enough - I think he may
have bribed the old guy to retire

BLATTIS
Popeye wasnt old Younger than you

They push through doors into the biggest room in the building
A dozen desks back to back and all the clutter and clatter of
typewriters and paperwork and Secretaries swapping the gossip
Too many cops to describe and no time to remember them anyway
But heres one making introductions About 60 years old Face

a mix of brick and fat The Chief of Eureka Police is CITRINE

CITRINE
Sergeants Serato and Taylor

Any handshakes and greetings that fit in around the equipment
Mr Travis I think you know
BERLIN
Do me a favor Travis Bring in
the resta the stuff from my car

BLATTIS tosses his parasol Dont lose it and follows BERLIN

BLATTIS
Did you find the knife Sergeant

BERLIN
No But we have a theory

BLATTIS
Kid told me he didnt take it

BERLIN
Maybe hes lying to you
By now theyre in an L shaped room with wood benches and bull-
etin board all over the walls Bullshit everywhere in packing

cases Dusty Playboy spreads amongst other junk on the boards

BLATTIS
Is it true you found a hand

And he benches the aquarium as BERLIN loses the insulated box
Is that it

CITRINE (0S)
Interview over Blattis

BLATTIS
Chief if its sensitive

16 INT MORGUE COUNTY HOSPITAL EUREKA DAY

ROSS has a Vic inhaler up his nostril An inadequate defense
A sudden stink slams into his neck muscles Head and inhaler
travel rearward He shifts eyes to BERLIN who scans the Bums
autopsy reports A PATHOLOGIST comments on his handiwork into
a microphone hanging from the ceiling Except as previously
noted the liver is not remarkable ROSS doesnt believe it

PATHOLOGIST
if the knife hadnt killed
him the booze would I nev-

er seen such a bad cirrhosis

BERLIN
You say the cuts left to right
(He does)
Isnt that unusual Hes left handed

He picks up a nicotine-stained left hand Simultaneously a LAB
TECHNICIAN wants BERLIN to sign in exchange for the picnic box

PATHOLOGIST
I guess he was so drunk he did-
nt know which hand he was using
(Re box)
What are you gonna do with it

BERLIN
Depends how healthy it is If its
any good Ill try and get a print
He hands the clip-board back and remembers a question for ROSS

Oh Ross that newspaper guy at the
station asked me if the hand was
frozen Why would he ask me that

ROSS
Frozen Ive no idea

Another fast fix on the Vic and BERLIN chews fresh gum A need-
le on a weighing machine quivers The liver weighs 1420 grams

A few beers wouldnt do
that to you would they

PATHOLOGIST
No Freddy Not a few

18 INT CRIME LAB POLICE STATION DAY

This in huge close-up Focus hardens on a finger tip A shock
of light The focus adjusts and a flash bulb fires again BER-
LIN moves away from the view-finder Chewing gum stuck to the
side of the camera returns to his mouth He activates an auto-
matic rewind It fills the silence while he heads for a phone

A lot of paraphernalia and technical type of shit The bullet-â€”

logue discovery of the bra This is Mike BlattisI cant take

paperwork VENABLES crouches over a desk filling something in

BERLIN

the corridor A couple of Coppers on their way in One big and
morose looking called BISLEY The other weve already met Tay-
lor is a tall balding guy with hazy reddish hair How you doin
BERLIN responds a happy OK with eyes returning to VENABLES

You know something strange about

VENABLES
Frozen

BERLIN

Apparently little They arrive in the big room Its deserted

Cmon Venables youre a policeman
And policemen always have an answer

BERLIN

VENABLES

ually in our county but south
of here Girl with no head no
hands You didnt read about it
(He didnt)

It was big shit They had forty
fifty detective working it Nev-
er identified her Never found
the head never found the hands

A vacuum cleaner starts somewhere but BERLIN isnt hearing it
So it could be that some crazys
stored her hand in a freezer and

only now decided to get rid of it

BERLIN
Where do I find the file on that

VENABLES
In there if we got anything I
believe the code was Jennifer
BERLIN is already looking A last question as VENABLES leaves

Was it really frozen Sergeant

BERLIN
No Been dead two weeks

20 INT CRIME LAB POLICE STATION DAWN

The atrophied Hand is emersed in some kind of fluid Index and
second fingers bound with wire just below the upper joint BER-
LIN reaches for steel pliers His face remains in close-up for
a nasty Snap as he cuts a finger off Hes filling a syringe

with the same fluid when ROSS walks in

Jesus you still here
BERLIN
What time is it
ROSS
Seven thirty-five Here
Town Gets Top Cop I was

gonna pin it to your wall

A newspaper featuring a small photograph and article on Berlin
Holding the Finger he carefully inserts a hypodermic needle un-

der the wire

BERLIN

Gently shoots in fluid to inflate the finger pad

Why so coy about the word frozen

ROSS
Because

BERLIN

Theres nothing in the files

ROSS
Watch my lips

Dont get into it

The Finger pad is sufficiently restored to try and get a print

It wasnt our case

21 jINT CRIME LAB POLICE STATION

DAY

wasnt our coun-
and got nothing to do with that

A slide projector does its stuff on a sheet of card pinned to

the door

Close-up of the Hand and off screen voice of BERLIN
Notice anything weird about it The answer from ROSS is No

A pen moves into frame and BERLIN points to marks on the Hand

BERLIN

Look - 1 - 2 -

The machine shunts up another slide Now the back of the Hand

I count eleven scars on this hand
and four that might be Now I

count em on my hand Five Im 42
years old This girls about 18
How come shes got so many scars
He walks out of the projection beam and neon light flutters on
So tell me about Jennifer

Reaches for a pack of cigarettes and perches on a nearby stool
You know Im gonna find out

BERLIN counts out cigarettes And destroys them in an ashtray

ROSS
Its an unsolved They spent 500
thousand dollars and bought emselves
a dead end - You might wanna check
it with Taylor he worked the case

BERLIN
I already did Whats his problem

ROSS reaches for the paper and thumb-tacks it to the wall That

ROSS
He thinks you stole his promotion
(Re cigarettes)
What exactly you doin there John

BERLIN
Its a method for quitting smoking

A Zippo opens (sports LAPD insignia) and BERLIN lights up
He takes a punishing hit and exhales a lungful across the lab

ROSS
Thats an interesting method
Must help beat the withdrawal

Back on his feet BERLIN is about to begin more work on the Hand

BERLIN
Its a technique I read about
If you smoke 60 a day you buy
three packs throw one cigar-
ette away and smoke 59 Day 2
you throw 2 away and smoke 58

ROSS
Why dont you throw them
all away and smoke none

BERLIN
Because its a ritual you gotta
go through with Im down to 10
Daftest thing Ross ever heard BERLIN is poised to make a print

ROSS
You want my advice

BERLIN
Maybe

ROSS
Find yourself a farmers daughter
with nice big fucking tits and
shake that bye-bye Send it to
Sacramento John I sniff grief

22 INT STAIRSLIVING ROOM BERLINS HOUSE DAY

gestions from ROSS win them another stair Plus advice from a

25 INT CRIME LAB POLICE STATION NIGHT

A florescent glow from a TV monitor supplies the only light
BERLIN vacillates interest between the scanner and the screen

CITRINE (0S)
What is that

BERLIN
Laser enhancement of the finger-
tip its really bothering me

See these striations right here
(Green on the screen)

Its like shes always worrying

the end of her finger Rubbing it

with a thumb nail or something

But CITRINE isnt interested in finger nails Hes staring at
a polystyrene torso of a faceless girl She wears a brassiere
stuffed with newspaper and a black wig (Welcome Jennifer Two)

Shes almost identical to Jennifer
Slim - White - same age - bra size
is even the same Nicely made lady

CITRINE stares at the Dummy like hes gonna ask it a question

CITRINE
How do you know her hairs black

BERLIN
Hair on her hand Plus Jen-
nifer had raven black hair
CITRINE
What is all this Jennifer stuff

He waves a handful of teletype before dumping it on a bench
These cases arent connected John

BERLIN
Yes Sir I think they maybe
I think Jennifer and this
lady got hit by the same guy

CITRINE
I dont see that at all

On the board is a super-imposed picture of a hand over a wrist

BERLIN
I got four points of posit-
ive comparison on the cut

CITRINE
Yeah thats all very inter-
esting but wheres the body

A question he doesnt need because he hasnt an answer CITRINE
has an eye on further photographs relevant to the Jennifer case

I dont know nothing about this Jenn-
ifer girl cept what some of the guys
told me - but principal feature of the
case was a gruesome displayal of the

body He wanted it found So if this is
the same guy whys he hidden this one

Another question he cant answer - and this time he doesnt get
a chance - BISLEY walks in with an apology for the interruption
Got a face like Humphrey Bogarts mother fucked a different guy

BISLEY
Just wondered if you had time to
get around to my pharmacy stuff

BERLIN
Youll have it in the morning

BISLEY
Alright Ill try again tomorrow

Bisley has gone but his tension stays BERLIN unwraps fresh gum

CITRINE
Probably making him feel a bit
antsy seein it back on the wall
He worked a lotta time on this

BERLIN
I thought it was Taylors case

CITRINE
Sucked in officers from all over
the county And it was the worst
six months this station ever had

This is CITRINEs shop and BERLIN isnt gonna row it with him

BERLIN
What do you want me to do Chief

CITRINE
Im not telling you what to do
What I will say is right now
that childs tricycle there is
more important to me than this

He refers to a little bicycle Vouchered and obviously stolen
By now CITRINE is at the hinges A pause before he disappears

Why dont you give it a minute and
stop by my office We should talk

26 INT MERCEDES SEDAN CITY OF EUREKA NIGHT

Melted neon in the streets A wet mid-town night Nothing but
sound of windshield wipers and click of a Zippo lighter ROSS
rides stoic passenger while BERLIN drives with festering eyes

ROSS
what does he think it is

BERLIN ROSS
Everything it isnt make a left

He even tried a self-inflicted

ROSS
Its possible

BERLIN
Cmon Ross the bra and hand were
in different bags a 100 feet apart
They stop at a light and a beeper goes as warning to the blind

Whats she gonna do Dump her bra
in one bag her hand in the other
and wander off whistling Hey Jude

ROSS
Its the garage on the far corner

BERLIN is worrying at his fingertip on the wheel of the Zippo
You cant stop it can you

BERLIN
What do you mean

ROSS
Worrying - clicking - picking - You
may as well be back in Los Angeles

BERLIN
What do you mean Ross

The lights change and off they go and BERLIN waits for a turn

ROSS
Why dont you dump it Mail it off
Give the fucking FBI a present

BERLIN
Why dont you dump the Fat Lady

ROSS
Because I dislike her too much

BERLIN
OK and Im not in love with this
fukker Thats how I feel about him

ROSS
No you dont Thats how you think
you feel about him Thats how you
feel about yourself You wont give
yourself one-fucking-minute for you

And by now theyve arrived and pulled up on the garage forecourt
Its indicative of their friendship that ROSS can talk like this

Wait for me It might not be ready

He quits the car and BERLIN watches him scurry towards a service
shop Rain beats on the roof and BERLIN looks stubbed out A lot
of cuts coming up and here are some of them Runs a hand through
his hair in unconscious frustration A finger constantly bothers
the Zippo Eyes towards ROSS who silhouettes in florescent light
Somewhere in the background the lights change to red Once again
the beeping sound of traffic-lights speaking to the blind Maybe
he looks across but that doesnt matter Something just happens

inside his head he isnt yet quite aware of Everything in close
up Big on the Zippo Big on BERLIN And he leaps out of the car

BERLIN sprints through the weather A station wagon is still in
the air at the end of an hydraulic jack Surprise from ROSS and a
MECHANIC as BERLIN arrives Fuck the fanbelt and listen to this

BERLIN
I just had this insane idea - if
Im wrong Ill take a week off
and redecorate your entire house

Rain beats at the roof and the jack sinks the wagon behind them

Shes blind Ross - thats why all
the scars - hear that traffic light
That noise is to help blind people -
thats why the marks on her finger-
tips - this lady reads in Braille

27 INT ADMINISTRATION POLICE STATION DAY

BERLIN sits at a desk at the end of the room Nothing here but
a legal pad and a phone The pad is covered in names and numbers
Right now hes into a call and this is sounding promisingHow
old And he writes 26 How long About 6 weeks ago Hope in
his eyes as he looks across to a woman called ANN Shes doing
what hes doing on a different line Wait a minute I specific-
ally said I was looking for a girl And all hope over because
Lesley is a boy But here comes ANN and this might be something

ANN
Shasta-Trinity Institute Line one

Sticks a sheet of notes on his desk and he junks the last call

BERLIN (New call)
Hello Yes This is Sergeant
Berlin Yes thats right I
believe my assistant explained
How long ago was that Uh-huh
OK Who is who Whass his
name Goodridge OK Ill hold

ROSS in transit grinning from ear to ear BERLIN interested in
little but his notes and ROSS in nothing but obvious good news

ROSS
Pig Woman agreed to take a test

BERLIN
I think I got something - twenty
two years old dark hair - study-
ing mathematics - (Yes yes Im
holding) - Last seen 5 weeks ago

28 EXT LANDSCAPEROAD TRINITY FOREST DAY

Mussorgsky is back on a shock cut Big music and a shattering
landscape Juniper woods and mountains Sunlight on fresh fal-
len snow Somewhere a long way off a car crawls up the valley

Rosss car bursts into frame and as quickly the bend snatches
it away An unexpected building in the distance Victorian at
a glance but probably later A clock tower and fifty lifeless
windows The Chevy disappears towards its somber architecture

29 EXT THE SHASTA-TRINITY INSTITUTE DAY

Pine trees and slush and parked cars The Chevrolet swings in
and parks in front of the mansion Breath in the air and eyes
on the ugly pile as they slam doors and head for its entrance

30 INT ENTRANCERECEPTION INSTITUTE DAY

BERLIN first with ROSS following As soon as they hit the ent-
rance they trigger a recorded voice YOU ARE NOW AT THE MAIN

ENTRANCE THERE ARE SIX STEPS Midway up them with ROSS look-
ing back RECEPTION IS THROUGH SWING DOORS AND TO YOUR RIGHT

31 INT PRINCIPALS OFFICER INSTITUTE DAY

GOODRIDGE is mid-50s with a beard like Abraham Lincoln Sits

far side of his desk alternating eyes between ROSS and BERLIN
The latter studies a photograph of a Girl ina file Its pos-
sible theyve found Jennifer Two How recent is the picture

GOODRIDGE
As recent as we have What ex-
actly is your interest in Amber

BERLIN
Im afraid I cant give you an ans-
wer to that Mr Goodridge As I ex-
plained to your secretary were do-
ing a lotta looking but were not
even sure its her were lookin for

GOODRIDGE
Then what are you hoping Im gon-
na do Dissuade or persuade you

BERLIN
I was hopin since we spoke that you
might have remembered something that
would give us an idea where she is

GOODRIDGE
Then you could have saved yourself
a lot of driving Sergeant What I
said on the phones the same as Im
saying now I got no idea where Amb-
er is or who it was took her there

He doesnt like them but not as much as ROSS doesnt like him

ROSS
A blind girl can just walk out of
here and you dont know who with

GOODRIDGE
You find something curious in that

ROSS
Yeah I guess I do

GOODRIDGE
Then let me put your mind at ease
Firstly Amber isnt blind - she

has some useful vision - and second
this isnt a prison its a college
of higher education - a severe vis-
ual disability doesnt mean my stud-
ents dont value their independence

as much as anybody else - and Amber
was a very independent young woman -
She decided to leave - so she left

ROSS
And you got no idea with who

GOODRIDGE
No Sergeant I got no idea with who
And I might add that in another six
weeks a hundred and fifty students
will be leaving here and driving away
for their Christmas holidays with pe-
ople whose name I-wont-know-either

ROSS could sock him in the crop but the phone rings and he ex-
cuses himself to answer it Whatever he hears he isnt liking
You have an appointment with Miss

Robertson
BERLIN
Yes Sir
GOODRIDGE

As shes a member of my staff
may I ask what this is about

BERLIN
Well apparently she saw Amber the
weekend she left and was briefly in
the room with the guy she left with

GOODRIDGE
I see Well shes teaching an-
other class at four Id apprec-â€”

iate it if you dont detain her
32 INT CORRIDOR INSTITUTE DAY

Looking back down a deserted corridor Someone tried to put sun-
shine on the walls with yellow paint Somewhere a long way away
there is a sound like children singing ROSS loathes this joint
Loathes its silence Eyes back to BERLIN as he rings a doorbell

ROSS
Where is everyone

BERLIN
I dunno I guess this is
staff side of the building

Here come footsteps and the door is opened by HELENA ROBERTSON
Early 20s and blonde and not immediately beautiful But delic-
ate features than need no make up and big dark eyes They look
away for introductions as though shes shy ROSS and BERLIN grab
glances as they follow in Neither expected HELENA to be blind

33 INT APARTMENT INSTITUTE DAY

Claustrophobia evaporates instantly Great views down the val-
ley from every window Plus a bizarre jumble of furniture and
colors But no pictures on the walls No friendly photographs
Nor any lights Although the afternoon is shutting down there
isnt a light in the room ROSS elects to stay at the windows
BERLIN takes an offered chair HELENA sits nervously opposite

HELENA
What dyou wanna ask Mr Ross
BERLIN
Im Mr Berlin Mr Ross is right
here And Mr Ross is maybe gonna
take a few notes if thats OK
(She nods)
OK Id like you to tell me
in what ever way you want what
you can remember about the time
you spent with Amber on the aft-
ernoon she left Take your time
and nothings too trivial OK

HELENA
Well I think I told you on the
phone I went up to her room

to say good-bye and we just sat
on the bed and chatted a while
while her friend was coming in
and out collecting her things

BERLIN
What kind of friend Was he a boy
friend An old friend New friend

Lots of headshake And lots of silences I really dont know

Thats OK Can you give me any

idea what this fellow was like
(Headshake)

Well dyou know how old he was
(Headshake)

Alright let me put it this way

How old dyou think I am Twenty-

six Thirty-nine Or fifty-three

HELENA
Fifty-three

Possibly the only grin ROSS is going to get out of this place

BERLIN
You must have some idea about him

HELENA
When we spoke on the phone
did you know I was blonde

BERLIN
No

HELENA
Why not You heard my voice
A good point And a point taken And BERLIN might even say so

We dont have some kind of
sixth-sense you know Ex-
cept in ridiculous novels

Now another silence overtaken by a low whistle in another room

A sardonic headshake from ROSS

He used a breath freshener

Well that solves the case then

And I think his name was John

BERLIN
John You never said that
on the phone What makes

you think his name was John

HELENA
I dont know I guess she must
have called him John Im mak-
ing tea Would you like some

BERLIN would but ROSS wouldnt She leaves and whispers begin

BERLIN
This looks promising I
think this one could be it

ROSS
Thank Christ we got a witness

BERLIN
Let me just keep going a while
She might remember something

ROSS

What Shes blind Bro You
may as well ask one of these
Beethoven guys on the piano

He thumbs a cluster of cheap busts of composers on an upright

Were better off having another
pop at old Abe Lincoln down the-
re Get angry with the prick Get
some of his useful visions in
Someone must have seen something

Negative from BERLIN Checked it out Sunday and no one about
This is fucken crazy Two hours
here two hours back and the
only word Ive written is John

A touch later and the sun is setting ROSS stands at a window
to watch it go Watches one or two cars driving away Watches
a bird sitting outside on the fire-escape BERLINs voice can
just about be heard off screen You said he spoke Can you re-
member what he said ROSS saunters back into HELENAs answer

HELENA
Well he just said come on
hurry up will you because
its starting to snow again

Empty teacups and empty notebook ROSS sits opposite BERLIN

And I remember he was a lit-
tle breathless from carrying
the cases because the elevat-
or had gone out that weekend

BERLIN
The elevator wasnt working

HELENA
No it has a mind of its own

A clock strikes four somewhere And BERLIN knows hes lost it

BERLIN
Can I see your hands

HELENA
My hands

He takes her hands and HELENA immediately looks uncomfortable
He examines scars and she stares at him with her useless eyes

I have a class I have to go

BERLIN
Is there anything else you can
tell me Anything about him or
her Doesnt matter how small

HELENA
No Except he smoked Like you

BERLIN
Me
HELENA
Yes I could smell it on his
breath like I can on yours

A taut instant between ROSS and BERLIN BERLIN caught out and
he knows it ROSS roars in silence YOU LYING PIG and writes
in his notebook The angle switches to see BERLIN IS A LIAR

Im late I really have to go
Everyone suddenly on their feet and HELENA gets into a jacket

BERLIN
Dyou have a dog Seeing Eye Dog

HELENA
No

BERLIN
Lotta scratch-marks on your door

HELENA
Sometimes I look after friends dogs
if they go to dances or something

ROSS
Could I just refer you to
this memo here Sergeant

He tries to get his notebook under BERLINs nose But BERLIN
isnt looking or listening but following HELENA into her hall

BERLIN
Did Amber have a dog

HELENA
Yes

BERLIN
What color was it

HELENA
I dont know

She opens the door and ROSS is barely through before it slams
34 INT CORRIDOR INSTITUTE DAY
ROSS baits BERLIN up the corridor Ridicules in silence while

counting imaginary winnings Watch my lips FIFTY HELENA
walks innocent of the pantomime and BERLIN tries to ignore it
BERLIN
if she writes or calls or any-
thing at all you let me know OK

He bells the elevator refusing to acknowledge ROSSs bullshit
Ill leave a number with the office

Lips drill a whisper into his ear Fifty fucken dollars OK
What exactly do you teach Helena

HELENA
Music composition and cello

ROSS
Fifty of em And I want em now

Meanwhile the elevator arrives triggering a Voice YOU ARE NOW
ON THE FOURTH FLOOR Doors slide open and Christ look at this
What kind of eye-defect needs glasses like this Lenses like ei-
ther half of a glass ball Hes early 30s and decidedly iffy
Is he studentstaff or what As he exits they enter staring aft-
er him As the doors close the MYOPIC turns to stare after them

35 INT CHEVROLET TRINITY VALLEY DUSK

ROSS drives and BERLIN studies Ambers file Wanna beer No
answer but cans appear anyway from a pack between Rosss legs

BERLIN
Had a seeing Eye Dog since she
was eighteen didnt I tell

you those dogs meant something

ROSS
No you didnt

BERLIN
Alright I didnt but I nearly
did and if I had Id have been
right I knew there was some-
thing about that Labrador that
dog was too good to be dead
We gotta get back up that dump

ROSS
No way not me Mister Im not
going up there again Might find
someones prick in a hot-dog roll
BERLIN

ROSS

iene rules Hes long gone in lime

ROSS pops cans and hands one over But BERLIN doesnt want it

BERLIN
Maybe not Im feeling lucky

ROSS
So am I But wheres my money

BERLIN

bet you cant keep winning it

ROSS
Pay me and I shut up

BERLIN

ROSS
Then give me that Zippo

BERLIN

ROSS

BERLIN
I had one puff on a pipe

ROSS

weird-looking stuff called cash

Snaps fingers Gimme the lighter And he does to shut him up
Ill tell you what Im gonna do
Im gonna do you a big favor

Forget the 50 and Ill keep this

BERLIN
What do you want it for

ROSS
To throw out of the window

ROSS

ber the old Bums lungs

BERLIN

imental attachment to that

ROSS
You want me to stop the car

An academic question considering the Zippo went down a ravine

BERLIN
No Get me to that garbage dump
Im gonna find that fucking dog

36 EXT CITY DUMP CITY OF EUREKA NIGHT

Gloom congeals around flashlights A winter mist falling down
TRIMBLE and Doberman watch as BERLIN goes at it with a shovel
A dozen graves already dug and hes halfway into another Des-
pite the cold he sweats in shirt sleeves Also breathless and
rests to catch his wind Dont you have to go to bed No he
doesnt He wants to see the victim Digging recommences with
TRIMBLE supplying the light BERLIN suddenly stops Get that
lamp down here White lime Black fur Theyve found the Dog

BERLIN begins an examination holding a tiny flashlight in his
teeth Eyes excitedly back to TRIMBLE and gesturing towards a
bag That bag there You find a knife and a paira long-nosed
pliers TRIMBLE does it relishing the snap of a switch-blade

BERLIN still busy with the light in his mouth TRIMBLE pissed
because he cant see whats happening BERLIN removes a crump-
led bullet from the back of the Labradors skull Holds it up
for scrutiny Small calibre Badly distorted Looks like a 22

BERLIN
You didnt shoot him did you
TRIMBLE
Me I love dogs Ask him

37 INT ANTI ROOMADMINISTRATION POLICE STATION DAY

LETTERS BIG AS A HOUSE And Loud The printer reciprocates as
fast as its mechanics are capable Details coming in from San
Diego VICAP Case NumberFBI Case NumberVictim Statusetc
etc Letters smacking into paper too fast to read But one de-
tail is repeated constantly and underlined Identity Unknown

Transmission ends and BERLIN hauls at least a yard of homicide
out of the machine Cant believe what hes looking at Jesus
He hit six Reads as he walks back into the big room and gets
interrupted by a call Miss Robertson Holding He heads for
the phone with eyes following ANN Find Ross for me will you

BERLIN (Phone)
Berlin yeah thats nice of
you Helena but I already found
out black yes No no of
course not good of you to call
You heard a what A hollow car

A hand shoves papers at the edge of his vision TAYLOR looks a
mite cheesy You got a minute for this And BERLIN nods sure

Yes Im still here Why didnt
you mention that I see Al-
right we should talk again No
Im just south of my eye-lids in

it right now How about Sunday

38 EXT COAST ROAD HUMBOLDT BAY EUREKA DAY

The first shining day of November Sand dunes and an infinite
stretch of beach Behind the sea-break is a lagoon and a tiny
harbor Berlins Mercedes descends the coast road towards it

39 EXT HARBOR HUMBOLDT BAY EUREKA DAY

Rosss boat is a 35 foot fisherman Shining brass and varnish
But like him its getting on and often grumpy This last qual-
ity presently evident in both Engine roaring and ROSS is cov-
ered in oil BERLIN has to shout above the racket to be heard

BERLIN
I put the slug in for a ballis-
tics report the man tells me for
get it Soft lead its worthless
I think fuck it And fuck Citrine
I call a friend of mine in Los Ang-
eles and he runs our whole damned
show through a main-frame looking

for anything similar to our ladies
shot with a twenty-two - you dont
believe what he finds in San Diego

ROSS detours eyes to wave at his Son Watch those revs there

Would you shut it down a min-
ute Ross This is important

ROSS signals BOBBY to turn off And the diesel splutters down

ROSS
Alright lets take a walk around
the block I gotta buy a gasket

40 EXT QUAYHARBOR HUMBOLDT BAY DAY

Seagulls and sunshine and probably Saturday because the place
is busy ROSS walks with BERLIN up a wooden quay Their journ-
ey will take them across a small bridge towards a Marine Shop

BERLIN
Six girls over a period of 18
months and give or take a head
or two the MOs exactly the
same Dark hair No hands All
shot with a high velocity twen-
ty-two in the back of the head

ROSS
How come the FBI dont put
anya this together They work-
ed over Jennifer for months

BERLIN
They possibly did - but they nev-
er had a head so they never had
a bullet - and they never got an

ID - not on any of em - never
bust a homicide unless you know
who your victim is - were the

first to get a positive identity

ROSS
Identity of whom You got a girl
doesnt even have a drivers lic-
ense Shes untraceable John
You need fifty detectives on this

BERLIN
Thats what Im here for I want
you to come and see Citrine with
me Hes not gonna here it from
me but I know hed listen to you

ROSS
Listen to me saying what

BERLIN
I wanna take that fucking Blind In-
stitute to pieces Every address

book every phone call everyone in
and outta there in the last 5 years

ROSS
For a dead dog

BERLIN
Weve fused into a major series
Ross This girl isnt the second
victim This is Jennifer Eight

And this is the second time they stop and stare at each other

That old Wino on the heap wasnt

a suicide He stumbled into some-
thing saw something and whoever
took him out knew how to fake it

ROSS
That isnt what you said before

BERLIN
I was wrong

Says it with remarkable humility considering hes the expert

Im going in to see Citrine this
afternoon Will you come with me

ROSS
Youre not Hes in hospital
He was trying out a new pair of
skis in his hallway The phone
rings and he goes for it and
falls off He must be the only
skier in Northern California to
break a leg in his living room

They arrive at the Chandlers with BERLIN in no mood to smile

BERLIN
You believe me dont you

ROSS
What does it matter what I bel-
ieve What you gotta worry

about is what Citrine believes
But he doesnt really believe it And doesnt enjoy saying no

But I cant help you with this We
cant go through the door with two
contentious issues you with a mass
murderer and me with the Mayors

best friend Do that we lose both
Im sorry Bro youre on your own

41 EXT TRINITY VALLEY DAY (HELICOPTER)

The Mercedes and Music travel north The latter made sinister
by this landscape Forest plunging into dark ravines The sun
colors the mountains red But most of the valley is in shadow

42 EXT DRIVEPARKING SHASTA-TRINITY INSTITUTE DAY

A high wind in the chimneys And the view is still from above
Like someones looking down from the top of the building And
maybe someone is BERLIN parks it and gets out Stretches and
walks towards the institute He looks very small from up here

43 INT GYMNASIUM INSTITUTE DAY

HELENA plays Elgar in an empty gymnasium Sunlight streams in
staining the air red As BERLIN arrives doors on the opposite
wall flap together like somebody just hurried out Did he see
someone Perhaps not The trees outside move a lot of shadows

Music stands Vacant chairs BERLIN takes one to watch her re-
hearse Realizes just how beautiful she is And HELENA realiz-â€”
es someone is there Before she can ask he identifies himself

HELENA
Have you been here long

BERLIN
No just a minute or two I
knocked on your door - no one
home so I followed the music

HELENA
Im sorry Ill get my things

BERLIN
No problem Im not in a hurry
But shes already fussing about stuffing sheet music in a bag

Matter of fact I saw a little
restaurant place down the road
Looked kinda pretty I thought
maybe we could have some lunch

No answer but the answer is no BERLIN finds her book for her

Alright whatever Was some-
one in here with you When I
came in the door was flapping

HELENA
I dont think so No one
comes here at the weekends

44 INT STAIRCASE INSTITUTE DAY

The gale shouts its head off The Camera looks down from above
Nothing to see except the stairwell and a hand on the banister

HELENA (0S)
I suppose Im the worst
witness youve ever had

BERLIN (0S)
I gotta admit youre one of
them Just wish I knew what
you meant by a hollow car

HELENA (0S)
Well some cars sound fat and
some cars sound thin and this
kind of car sounded hollow

Any moment now they turn a corner of the stairs into close-up

Maybe it was a foreign car
Our kinda cars sound fat

The elevator is parked on this floor with its doors half open

Are you sure you wanna see it
Its another three floors up

Despite breathlessness he does How often does it break down

Oh all the time They keep
threatening to have it re-
placed but they never will
45 INT ATTIC APARTMENT INSTITUTE DAY

Gloomy windows and a wardrobe BERLIN walks in leaving HELENA
at the door I sat right there on the bed The bed is gone
but why tell her He checks the wardrobe Guess what Hangers

HELENA
If I came to the diner with
you would you bring me back

BERLIN
Of course I would

His smile deteriorates as he realizes shes staring at him

What are you staring at Hel-

ena I mean Im sorry
HELENA

Thats alright You suddenly

reminded me of him He was

standing right where you are
ind of breathless like you

Nothing happening except the wind Then a smile as she leaves

ll get my coat wait
for you downstairs

And he begins an exploration Musty bathroom with old-fashion-
ed fixtures A tap leaking behind shower curtains Nothing in
the cabinet Nothing under the sink Six steps and he is ina
kitchen Finally finds something worth looking for Tears the
sack out of a vacuum cleaner Discovers a knot of hair froma
black dog Simultaneously the door slams Shock powers him in-
to the sitting room in time to hear a key turning in the lock
Hits the door and shouts Hears footsteps moving rapidly away

46 INT RECEPTION INSTITUTE DAY

A huge Christmas poster advertises SHASTA-TRINITY ARTSCRAFTS
HELENA sits in the deserted foyer reading Braille The volume
is the size of a phone directory BERLIN appears via the main
entrance Windswept and wasted and surprised shes still here

BERLIN
Im sorry someone slammed the
door on me I couldnt get out

HELENA
It was probably the wind

Hellava wind that turns a key But he says nothing Takes the
book while she gets into her coat Shes obviously made an ef-
fort A change of clothes and her hair pinned up But she has
got the sweater on inside out and the label is under her chin

BERLIN
What are you reading

HELENA
Hamlet Have you read it

BERLIN
No

HELENA
You should Its wonderful

By now theyre at the doors with BERLIN escorting her through
47 INT RESTAURANTDINER TRINITY VALLEY DAY

Red brick walls and help yourself to salad All but empty and
their food is yet to arrive BERLIN is clearly having a tough
time with the conversation Basically because there isnt any

BERLIN
Tll tell you what if I prom-
ise to stop being a cop will you
promise to stop being a witness

HELENA sits frozen like shes waiting for results of an X-ray
I mean we dont havta sit here

question You could ask one too

HELENA
Are you wearing a uniform

BERLIN
No

HELENA
Oh

BERLIN

Well Im glad we got the conver-
sational side of lunch over with

HELENA
Im sorry I dont like sitting
in the middle of a restaurant I
feel like everyones looking at me

BERLIN
Theres no one looking at you
Theres hardly anyone in here The
only person looking at you is me

And he likes what hes looking at And maybe HELENA senses it

HELENA
Are you married

BERLIN
Was But I dont like to talk about it

HELENA
You just asked me to ask you questions

BERLIN
I know but you pick on the one time
in my life I like not to remember I
was in the bad lands Really not well
Its something that happens to a lota
cops We dont wanna talk about that

HELENA
Thoughts that lie too deep for tears

BERLIN

ived Its clear GOODRIDGE is profoundly unhappy to see BERLIN

BERLIN
I dont know I havent read much I

prayers Not often Theyre Junk Mail

48 INT MERCEDES SEDAN SHASTA-TRINITY INSTITUTE DAY

Big pines either side of the driveway The Camera sits in the
back more interested in the approaching institute than BERLIN

BERLIN
I got really sick of the street
so I went to school and became a
Scientific Services Officer which
is basically a Scene of Crime Off-
icer Then this came up and I got
what they call a Lateral Transfer

Pulls into a parking spot and the next sound is the hand brake

I couldnt take another minute of
Los Angeles Felt like Id said
sorry in every street in the city

HELENA
Sorry

BERLIN
sorry your father mother sis-
ter whatever I couldnt take

gonna rob you of a cup of coffee

49 EXTINT FIRE ESCAPEAPARTMENT INSTITUTE DUSK

BERLIN looks down from the fire escape For the first time the
place sounds busy Cars arriving and doors slamming Voices of
Students coming back from the weekend Why were you out there
HELENA waits inside and didnt realize he was back in the room

HELENA
Coz I wanted to feel the snow
on my face I think thats

when I heard her call him John
Time to go and both know it Stale shadows and growing silence

Is it snowing now
BERLIN
No Getting dark though

And his eyes are searching her so hard she must be aware of it

You think youd know this man If
he was in the room with you again

HELENA
Youve already asked me that

The silence is almost uncomfortable BERLIN continues to stare
Ambers dead isnt she

BERLIN
Yes Im sorry

50 EXT SUBURBAN STREET CITY OF EUREKA DAY

Pretty houses in a pretty little street Hills in the back and
sunshine out front BERLIN pulls up in his Mercedes and does a
bit of tie adjusting as he walks up a path and hits the chimes
This could only be MRS CITRINE A budget smile and hes inside

51 INT STUDIOCONSERVATORY HOUSE DAY

Dozens of repulsive paintings A truly repulsive painting By
Numbers of the Mona Lisa in progress The color codes are com-
pletely fucked up CITRINE wears a wooly hat and hates walking
on crutches BERLIN picked a bad day to come in here with this

CITRINE
Youre pushing this too hard Its

going John Theres other work to
do why dont ya ease off a little

BERLIN
Coz this is a major and were closer to
this bastard than anyones ever been

CITRINE
Then wheres the body Wheres
the body and whys he hidden it

BERLIN
He hasnt hidden it He never made
a hit this far north before and
he never read a weather forecast
Shes probably fifteen feet from
the highway three feet under snow

CITRINE
Have you got a match on the bullet

BERLIN
No

CITRINE
Have you got a print from the hand

BERLIN
No Sir

CITRINE
It could be anyones hand Illeg-
ally disposed of hospital debris

BERLIN
Its her hand Her scars Her dog
Her dogs shot And shes missing

CITRINE
Shes not missing Did she shout
Did she scream Did he coerce her
No She left of her own free will
And if she gets on a plane and goes
to Peru with the prick shes still
not missing You got no case John

BERLIN
If youre not gonna hear me Chief

CITRINE
I have heard you You just dont like
hearing me You got this whole damned
thing outta proportion I dont know
what you gotten used to in Los Angeles
but I dont believe theres a Police
Chief in this country would put a
task force together for a body part

BERLIN
We have a multiple homicide Sir

CITRINE
We have a body part in suspicious
circumstances - a tailors dummy
wearing a brassiere - anda bill
for seventeen dollars for its wig
52 INT CORRIDORADMINISTRATION POLICE STATION DAY

BERLIN arrives at the station in the same mood he left Citrine
Heads for his room and runs into ROSSs stare Problems on his
plate too He sits at his desk looking uncharacteristically an-
xious What ever hes drinking isnt tea He finds a bottle of
JandB in a drawer and walks toward Berlins freshly slammed door

52 INT CRIME LAB POLICE STATION DAY

The lab is stuffed with junk waiting his attention (Dozens of
common things made sinister by their labels and plastic sacks)
ROSS delivers a dose of Scotch in a plastic cup Pours himself
another Leans on a bench and gets into the pissed-off silence

ROSS
Did he shut you down

BERLIN
All but How you doing

ROSS
I dunno I darent go in there -

ing with his staff We should be

BERLIN

He almost does the whiskey but reaches for chewing gum instead

He thinks the kid shot the dog
He looks at ROSS like what-are-you-looking-at-me-like-that-for
He didnt

ROSS
Did I say he did

BERLIN
You looked like you did

ROSS
No I think youll find I looked like
he could have By accident even Hes
up here spraying the scenery all day

BERLIN
He didnt shoot it Ross And

flash-burn It was point-blank

SERATO walks in with a cigarette plugged into his ashen kisser

SERATO
Flying colors

ROSS

Say you didnt say that Angelo
SERATO

ROSS

Oh my God Mothers shit Are we in it
54 INT ANTI ROOMINTERROGATION POLICE STATION DAY

This room and the interrogation room are linked with a one-way
mirror BERLIN looks through munching gum EMERSON is 25 years
old and many pounds of vexed flesh But something about her ex-
pression expects apology SERATO paces the place chain-smoking
ROSS listens devastated as the EXPERT explains his lousy chart

EXPERT
This is the important one She
gets a dead straight line and
thats an exceptional reading

SERATO
this is the stupidest thing
we ever done Fucking Citrines
gonna fire one of us for this

ROSS
I cant believe it I just
know she someway busted it

EXPERT
This is an honest girl She
couldnt lie if she tried

BERLIN
Is she lying Ross

For a moment there is an intense trust between ROSS and BERLIN

ROSS
Yes
Alright fuck it Lets go for broke BERLIN grabs the read out
Fueled on residual anger he vanishes out the door ROSS is fir-
st at the mirror to see him reappear in the interrogation room

55 INT INTERROGATION ROOM POLICE STATION DAY

The polygraph machine looks like state of the art A table and
two chairs BERLIN takes one and sits opposite EMERSON She at-
tempts a smile but he kills it with the intensity of his stare

BERLIN
My names Sergeant John Berlin

And the time is his He knows what hes doing And she doesnt

I been a policeman 17 years 16
years 9 months of which with the
LAPD I witnessed literally
hundreds of lie-detector tests
and I never seen one like this

EMERSON
What dya mean Sergeant

BERLIN
Well look at it Look at this
line Thats the important one
Dead straight down the page No-
body gets a dead straight down
the page Even our expert says
a dead straights exceptional

All hes doing is telling her truth Up to her to interpret it
Thought you might wanna comment
A tongue slides through the lipstick like something being born

EMERSON
I wasnt actually lying Officer

And suddenly the only thing holding her chops up is Max Factor
Hes got her on the roll now and all it needs is one more push

BERLIN
You busted the box lady You flunk-
ed it You lied about things you
didnt need to lie about The only
truthful statement you mades your
name Your name is Carol Emerson

The quivering lip and flooding eyes amalgamate into a horrible
sort of groan Shes bellied up and anxious to spill her beans
BERLIN better get through the door fast because he might laugh

You tell one more lie youre go-
ing in a cell Sergeant Ross is
coming in to take your statement

56 EXT ROSSS BOAT HUMBOLDT BAY EUREKA DAY

A wave atomizes and comes down like silver champagne HELENA and

BERLIN hang on the prow of the boat with the ocean rushing bel-
ow Another wave and more spray for HELENA She turns like get-
ting sea in your face is the best invention ever Oilskins sat-
urated and her hair streaming and she knows hes loving it too

57 INT WHEELHOUSE BOAT DAY

Sunshine and spray on the windshield ROSS at the wheel with MAR-
GIE next to him Eyes on BERLIN and HELENA playing like children

MARGIE
Such a shame Shes
a really sweet kid

ROSS
Shes a doll But I wish he
hadnt brought her out here

Stairs descend to a cabin and ROSS interrupts himself to shout

Bobby what happened to that
beer Rule one is you dont
diddle around with a witness

MARGIE
Hes happy darlin

ROSS
Im sure he is But gettin in-
to the element is a bad idea

BOBBY clatters up the stairs clutching a six pack of Budweiser

Tell em Im going up the coast

BOBBY exits the wheelhouse and walks their eyes back to HELENA
MARGIE (0S)

Except for the hair color
she looks just like Suzanne
ROSS (0S)
Well thats who she is
Cept she cant run away

58 EXT FISHING DECK ABOVE WHEELHOUSE BOAT DAY

Wind over and sea content and anchored about a mile from shore
Smoke from a dying barbecue and Nat King Cole croons Unforget-
able ROSS sports shades and sits staring down the line Some-
one plays lousy guitar and he shifts eyes into the well of the
boat HELENA teaches BOBBY to play chords Hardly worth the ef-
fort but theyre enjoying it BERLIN looks down from the oppos-
ite side of the deck His gaze interrupted by MARGIE You want
another Coke honey Sure he does and her eyes travel to ROSS

MARGIE
You want something darling

ROSS
I wouldnt mind another BEER

In code so BERLIN wont understand But he and ROSS swap grins
How much longer you on that diet

BERLIN
Im doing it by the day

MARGIE climbs the stairs with drinks and drinks a beer herself
Popped cans change the subject This seems like a question BER-
LIN doesnt really want to ask and MARGIE doesnt want to answer

Hows your little sister

MARGIE
Shes in Europe

BERLIN
Working

Clearly a sensitive subject and ROSS decides the truth is best

ROSS
She married some English prick

MARGIE
Hes not that bad of a guy

ROSS
Got a handshake like a
partially excited penis
The joke doesnt reach BERLIN MARGIEs hand is on his shoulder

MARGIE
Her loss darlin

And she heads for the lower deck A sweet smile as she descends

Anyway youre doing O
K Shes a sweet heart

And also playing the guitar In My Life And she does it well

ROSS
Whys she blind Bro

BERLIN
Car accident

Slow banging of something swaying And this exchange goes slow
Whole family wiped out

ROSS
No shit

A bleeper goes on one of the lines and ROSS twists in his seat
Strap me in Here comes another

And he winds in yet another three quarters of a pound Mackerel
Worst days fishing I ever had

BERLIN
Its been a great day

ROSS dexterously extracts the hook with serious eyes on BERLIN

ROSS
You just go easy Brother
(Looks at fish)
Alright were all goin home

59 EXT CAR PARK AT BEACH DUSK

Darkness in about an hour Wide over the car park Sand dunes
surround it Practically deserted of cars Headlights snap on
focusing attention on a station wagon exchange of good-byes

HELENA (VO)
I really liked Margie
Silhouettes with exaggerated shadows walk across the car park
What does she do

BERLIN (VO)
She runs a kind of hair dress-
ing and you know beauty salon

HELENA (VO)
Have you known her long

BERLIN (VO)
I was married to her sister

The angle changes and is closer now HELENA has taken his arm
You dont ask what Im like

HELENA
I know what youre like

BERLIN
How dyou know what Im like

HELENA
Ross told me

BERLIN

HELENA
He said youre quite chubby
And you have a nervous tick

BERLIN
He said that What else did
he say

HELENA

Just your age

BERLIN
Which is what

HELENA
Fifty-seven I dont mind

BERLIN is more amused than annoyed They arrive at the car and
his suggestion is met with an appropriate response from HELENA

BERLIN
You wanna drive Cmon were
in a car park miles from any-
where Theres nothing arou-
nd but nothing and sand dunes

I cant drive a car Doesnt like cars But hes not hearing

Cmon itll be fun You can
drive me around in circles

No lady ever had a driving lesson like this before BERLIN all
but sits in her seat Arm on the back of it Hand on the wheel
For a split second theyre doing 60 Now theyre doing about 4

The Mercedes spirals in widening circles Instructions and enc-â€”
ouragement from BERLIN OK Straight now The Mercedes
straightens and heads through the dunes Its a big car park

Were going along a little track
HELENA may like driving but she doesnt like the sound of that
Its OK Its not a public road

Headlights behind them approach quickly Disappear and reappear
as they follow the geography of the dunes BERLIN only now bec-
omes aware of them one more dip and they slam in Her anxiety
is misinterpreted He takes the wheel No problem Let him pass
The vehicle is right up behind them As it overtakes HELENA is
scared And still scared even though BERLIN has stopped the car

Its alright Im sorry It was
my fault it wasnt a good idea

HELENA
That was the Hollow Car John

Just time to see tail lights of a van disappearing in the gloom

BERLIN
A Volkswagen van Are you sure

60 INT LIVING ROOM BERLINS HOUSE NIGHT

Rain lashes the windows But a lot of improvements inside New

of every John in California with a V

61 INT CHIEFS OFFICE POLICE STATION DAY

A painting of Ronald Reagan fills the screen So awful its al-
most impressive Next to it is a formal photograph of the City
Mayor (Mr Heineman) BERLIN continues to wait with eyes switch-
ing to a picture of the Taj Mahal I love to paint He turns
as CITRINE walks in Its not great art but I change the col-
ors Heads for his desk and sits dispensing with the crutches

CITRINE
Im shutting you down on

BERLIN

embarrassing Mr Heineman

CITRINE
Dont underestimate me the
Mayors pissed - but thats
nothing to do with this - sit
down - How many times have you
been up at that institute

BERLIN
Three or four

CITRINE
Im talking outside the girl
BERLIN
Once

CITRINE
Got a letter from this Goodridge guy
Says youre upsetting his students

BERLIN
Thats bullshit

CITRINE
He says you freaked one of em out
(Reading the letter)
Asking a newly blind kid if he can
see is both cruel and dangerous

He floats the letter across the desk and hears the explanation

BERLIN
I never asked if he could see I
just asked one or two of the stud-
ents if they remembered anything

CITRINE
And did they

BERLIN
No

CITRINE rubs his forehead in preparation to change the subject

CITRINE
m not a nasty man John Im a nice
man I get a lot of Christmas cards

(a lot of cards on the wall)
and Im getting a lot of complaints
The guy you replaced was something you-
re not - a lazy sonovabitch - but the
reality is I was getting a faster ser-
vice outta Popeye than I am outta you
cant allow this to continue John

fq

If there was any argument to be had BERLIN would be arguing it

dont want you up at that institute
again and Im flat-out about that

to you - you can go tell your witness
if you feel you must - but as far as
youre concerned the case is closed

Waving his empty at the bar ROSS communicates need for another

How dyou know this girl isnt lying

ing up stuff to keep you coming back

about important enough to get a close-up TIME 1852 SUBJECT
A MAN CALLED DAN STANLEY TELEPHONED SAYS THERE ARE 109 JOHNS

stares at Jennifer 8 Fuck this for a Friday night Hes had
enough of it Grabs several envelopes and turns out the lights

67 INT ADMINOFFICE POLICE STATION NIGHT

BERLIN emerges from one office and heads for another JK Tay-
lor on the door Delivers the envelope and an his way out when
something detains him Lights on the tree strobe through venit-
ian blinds Illuminate bits and pieces of rattan Plus a board
covered in Christmas cards and a pair of steel filing cabinets

Maybe motivated by the booze But a desk drawer is open almost
before he realizes it and he searches for a key Nothing but a
bunch of business cards and family snaps Taylor with his Moth-
er Taylor with his Sister (red hair like him) and Taylor with

his Dog The drawer slams and one underneath opens Same flot-
sam of personal junk Scotch Tape and paper clips and more bus-
iness cards A bottle of tablets and salad of loose ammo Fuck
all else and he closes the drawer But whats this A cane let-
ter rack at the rear of the desk where he finds a pair of keys

Excitement lasts as long as it takes to try them Dont fit ei-
ther lock Now hes staring at the shadows with nothing moving
but thoughts A few moments more and hes heading for the door

68 INT OFFICE POLICE STATION NIGHT

Massive close-up of the lock A weird looking tool goes in and
another follows it This bastard aint easy even for an expert
The frame widens to reveal BERLIN He shuffles picks in a wall-
et on top of the cabinet Was that a noise somewhere He stops
to listen wipes cold sweat away Only thieves and foxes about

A final twist and the lock delivers Several dozen manilla col-
ored files from which to choose A pair of folders titled Jenn-
ifer travel to the desk The first is full of press-cuttings and
some gruesome looking snaps Next file and this one looks more
interesting A notebook full of random questionsanswerscomm-
ents A list of ships and sailing times MUST FOLLOW THIS UP

Underlined twice CANT OVER ESTIMATE IMPORTANCE Also under-
lined Lists of numbers Street numbers Vehicle numbers What-â€”
ever they might be is history because the neon just flashed on
TAYLOR stands in the doorway The surprise is mutual The play
one-sided This is already TAYLORs game Smokes his cigarette
BERLIN is up to elbows in the jam jar and up to him to explain

BERLIN

this guy and all the time feel
like Im sharpening a pencil with
a broken load Im sorry King J

TAYLOR
What are you looking for

BERLIN
Vehicle references

TAYLOR
Wrong cabinet

He gestures to the right one BERLIN feels about 2 inches tall
Im gonna get some coffee When you
finish in here maybe youll let me

As he exits he tosses a bunch of keys They crash uselessly on-
to the desk BERLIN looks like he couldnt get a fuck with mud

69 EXT ROAD TRINITY VALLEY DAY

71 INT CORRIDOR INSTITUTE DAY

Christmas vacations and the building sounds deserted BERLINs
foot steps might be the only sound in the place They stop and

BERLINs face gets ready for something he doesnt say Why did

BERLIN
I have to talk to you Helena

HELENA

HELENA

She stands and collects the cups and gets halfway with a smile
Ill make some more coffee

74 INT KITCHEN APARTMENT DUSK

A hiss of running water Close on the kettle Close on the tap

She knows what hes going to say And now shes alone her face

doesnt mask her feelings Shes missing him already But does-â€”

nt know why Simply knows she doesnt want him to say goodbye

She reaches high into a cupboard Her shirt stretches over her
breasts Christ this girl has a great figure Carting hair out
of her eyes she returns to the sink For an instant shes star-
ing out of the window and right into somebodys face Tall and
weird looking But just a glimpse before he moves rapidly away

75 INT APARTMENT DUSK

BERLIN has moved to the sofa A shaft of dead sunlight crosses
the apartment HELENA comes in making a brave face of it Does-
nt realize hes moved Im here Helena And she smiles and
changes direction Puts the coffee tray on a table in front of
him No music now and all sounds in close-up Close on the lip
of the coffee pot as she pours Close on the cup she gives him
Everything close in Helenas world or her world wouldnt exist

76 EXT (POV FROM FIRE ESCAPE) INSTITUTE DUSK

Not a lot to look at but the man is looking in From his POV
hes fortunate HELENA sits facing him but BERLIN has his back
to the window This sort of surveillance is always ominous and
here is no exception BERLINs explanation comes with occasion-
al use of hands HELENA suddenly smiles so it cant be all bad

They stand and BERLIN reaches for his coat HELENA crosses the
room Finds her Forget-Me-Nots and now theyre his at the door
As he takes them he takes her hand Kisses her finger tips and
cant avoid embracing her They kiss like awkward kids bumping
noses Finally part and disappear into the dark of the hallway

77 INT ELEVATORCORRIDOR INSTITUTE DUSK

BERLIN is already in the elevator Resists doors determined to
separate them They shunt in and out perpetually informing him
hes on the 4th floor Ill call OK She nods and releases
his hand He watches her walk all the way back up the corridor

78 INT MERCEDES SEDAN TRINITY VALLEY NIGHT

Headlights follow the meandering road Another bend and lights
in the distance In seconds hes passing the Diner Still open
with cars out front including the white Volkswagen that nearly
busted his fender Hes not gonna stop Then decides to Makes

79 INT KITCHENLIVING ROOMBEDROOM APARTMENT NIGHT

HELENA finishes the dishes Stacks a last plate and closes the
cupboard Heads back into the living room Something about the
apartment doesnt sound right She follows the noise through a
door into a bedroom Curtains dance in the darkness and behind
them she finds a half open window Curious because she doesnt
remember leaving it open Secures it and silences the icy wind
80 EXT VOLKSWAGEN VANCAR PARK DINER NIGHT

BERLIN checks the drivers door Locked and he explores with a
pencil-flashlight Moves to a slide door at the side Simultan-
eously the door to the Diner opens releasing a quartet of midd-
le-aged Drunks He dissolves while they bullshit around Laugh-
ter in chill air The Comedian of the night keeps himself amus-â€”
ed Jokes about getting into the wrong car with the wrong wife
BERLIN isnt laughing Cmon you drunken fuck Get outta here

81 INTEXT VOLKSWAGEN VANCAR PARK DINER NIGHT

A slide door rolls open and BERLIN peers in Full of furniture
and cardboard crates stenciled TRINITY INSTITUTE - CRAFT DEPT
Worth the try but forget it This bastard obviously has legit-
imate business at the institute Takes a last poke around with
the light Spots something red A cigarette butt caked in lip-
stick But whats this white stuff Some kind of powder spills
from a capsule crushed in the door rails He picks it up for a
look and gets a bad one from behind Whatta you doing Mister

BERLIN finds himself facing an irate looking Woman in her 20s
A lot of red hair and freckles But definitely more frightened
than angry His Police Department badge is an instant sedative
Gives her some crap about thefts from vehicles round here She
should keep her doors locked She smiles and thought they were

BERLIN
Got your drivers license

She hands it across and he inspects it coz thats what cops do

I noticed you coming outta the
institute You up there a lot

WOMAN
Oh it was you that
nearly ran into me

BERLIN
No it was you that nearly ran
into me You up there a lot

doors are locked Merry Christmas

82 INT BATHROOMLIVING ROOM APARTMENT NIGHT

If theres moonlight thats the only light Nothing to see but
a pair of large taps Nothing to hear but a bath filling Then
something starts bleeping Its a liquid-level-indicator activ-
ated by rising water A hand searches for taps Shuts them off
and silences the indicator The frame expands to reveal HELENA

She moves to a hand basin Finds a brush and fixes hair Finds
a clip and pins it up Close as she kicks off shoes Pantyhose
descend on top of them Walks into the living room unbuttoning
her shirt Vanishes into the bedroom and the Camera waits Ret-
urns with towels and the Camera follows back into the bathroom

A creaking hinge as she closes the door A dressing gown hangs
on a hook She reaches for it and turns and virtually bumps in-
to the Sonovabitch Dressed in black and stealthy as a cat He
retreats a pace deeper into the darkness Just enough light to
see he wears glasses And just enough light to see her undress

HELENA unzips her skirt Slides it down her lags Drapes it on
a chair Removes her shirt and hangs it on the back She wears
a white brassiere and panties And no apologies for repetition
This is a fantastic body She checks water temperature Either
too hot or too cold Either way a tap goes on Now she reaches
behind her back Unclips her bra Gets hit with dazzling light

The Intruder is taking photographs And if this is his turn-on
hes in paradise She stands in front of him in total oblivion
Her panties join clothes on the chair Nov shes naked and now
another picture Again the bathroom detonates with white light

His face is concealed by the camera But this bastard is about
to run out of luck Moves in as she silences the tap Suddenly
a lot of silence about HELENA twists in panic She just heard
something Didnt she just hear something Is somebody in here
Fear kills her scream She hits at the darkness But hes gone

83 INT LIVING ROOMKITCHEN BERLINS HOUSE DAY

Big close on telephone ringing No one home except the machine

still in its wraps Out the window a bonfire rages in the yard

up a corridor and through a door Faces look as he crosses the
department SECRETARIES and BISLEY and ROSS But only one face
of interest TAYLOR turns halfway through lighting a cigarette
Are you outta your fucken mind TAYLOR says nothing If any-
thing happens to that girl Im gonna break your fucking back

TAYLOR
Just easy on the words youre
putting in my face Sergeant

ROSS
Whass going on here

A question practically every expression in the place is asking

TAYLOR
His blind friend got attacked
Angelo went up there and some-
how it got itself in the paper

BERLIN
You put it in there

TAYLOR
I may have said some-
thing I dont recall

BERLIN
Dont lie Taylor I just had
this Blattis guy on the phone
asking me for a comment - you
gave him the whole damned case

TAYLOR
Alright I gave him the case

So the case is closed so what

His indifference inflames BERLIN Smashes the newspaper at him
BERLIN
So read it You just hung
a target around her neck

TAYLOR
Bullshit

BERLIN
Dont you know nothing about this
guy He reads the newspapers Col-
lects the cuttings When are they
gonna find her Now hes reading
Helena Robertsons name phrased
like shes a fucking witness You
couldnt have done anything more
stupid if youd sat down and tried

TAYLOR
Hey cmon country boys lets
all line up and hear the expert

BERLIN
Just walk away from me Taylor

Now the volume is going up Now the whole department is silent

TAYLOR

You think youre the only guy
ever worked a homicide I was

a big-city cop too And I bust-
ed the clock on fucken Jennifer
I know more about this man than
youll over know - and thats
how I know it aint him - you-
re investigating a soap-opera

ROSS

TAYLOR
He tells her bye-bye and she
gets attacked Well give me a

ial Killer Stick her name up in
neon theres still no Serial kil-
ler And I aint the only one say-
ing it Everyone in this building

His cigarette

A big mistake

Harrison Ford

ROSS

ting holy over us Sure I put it in
the paper Coz I wanted to stop this

ta your head searching my office ag-
ain its pissing me and everyone off

BERLIN
You dont know what you done Taylor

TAYLOR
If your friend from San Diego was
up here and thought for one out of
two fucken seconds she was a danger
to him heda taken her out weeks ago

is already stubbed and hes already walking away

Why dont you get yourself a dict-
ionary Look up the word witness

BERLIN
I know what a witness is

TAYLOR
Well her it aint That bitch
is blind as a blonde fucken bat

Mister Taylor Mister Berlin suddenly turns into

TAYLOR slams into filing cabinets right next to
tree Gets BERLINs forearm under his throat and
not to get the knuckles in his gut Both men are

heaving No volume necessary in this room of paralyzed silence

BERLIN
Im gonna do something you never
did Taylor Im gonna catch this
bastard And when I do hes gon-
na find out just how good a wit-
ness she is Meanwhile you be
aware of me - coz I wish you ill
BERLIN moves away and the silence is brutal Nothing happening
but bad vibes ROSS and BERLIN exchange glances And this shit
is really bad BERLIN vanishes into his lab and the door slams

86 INT CRIME LAB POLICE STATION DAY

BERLIN and his Dummy wearing a bra and his photographs and his
rage are all alone And thats how they wanna be But the door
opens and here is ROSS Have to be a friend to survive in here

BERLIN
Nothing you gotta say do I wanna hear
right now So save yourself saying it

ROSS
Im not in here to apologize John
I told you what was gonna happen and
its happened Good-bye Princess
and the same night she gets attacked
Thats a tough one to swallow Bro

BERLIN
Im already familiar with Taylors
opinion

ROSS

You dont really believe this

BERLIN
One hundred fucking per cent
And you know why Coz I never
told her good-bye OK Is that
good enough for the committee

And as long as you like evaporates before ROSS can speak again

ROSS

Well I didnt know that
BERLIN

No You didnt know that

BERLIN is drinking whisky Sticks another slug in the cup Now
realizes whose bottle this is Slams it somewhere on the bench

Here You left your booze in here

ROSS
Who dyou think it was

Ross gets the kind of smile a smart guy wouldnt give an idiot
You think it was him

BERLIN
Thats a very stupid question Ross

ROSS
Im asking it

BERLIN
How the hell do I know who Some
jerk-off Some peeping-tom prick

His hand has found the switch-blade A nasty click as it opens

but definitely not him This
guys in the trade Hes not gon-
na stand there looking at her ass
if hes in the room shes dead

BERLIN puts the knife in his Dummy If shes alive Shes dead

ROSS
Ease off John

BERLIN
Im sick of this toy town shit

ROSS
Everything you say sounds reason-
able But theres also a reason-
able explanation for the opposite

BERLIN

Dont give me that Not another
word When you had the Fat Lady
in there and I asked you if she
was lying you looked me right
in the eyes and said yes So as
far as I was concerned shes ly-
ing And if the King of fucking
England had walked in and told me
different I wouldnt have bel-
ieved him - because you told me

This atmosphere would stretch any friendship to breaking point

And now Im telling you Im looking
you right in the eyes and telling ya
theres a bad man out there and I
dont know if hes in the next room
or the next state and I dont know
what his trigger is But if he reads
her name in the newspaper I believe

hell be inclined to do something ab-
out it Ive got a bad feeling And I
been doing this too long to be wrong

There are tough eyes to look into And ROSS finally looks away

ROSS
I dunno what I can do to help you

BERLIN
I dunno what Id do with your help
Ive gotta take her out of there

ROSS
What about Citrine

BERLIN
Screw Citrine He can fire me

87 EXT LANDSCAPE COUNTRY ROAD DAY

Wide over the countryside The car is a long way off A pretty
magic looking dawn Cows on hills and mist in the hollows The
Mercedes finally arrives Up the track and into the (refurbish-
ed) garage Engine off and little but a sound of singing birds

88 INT LIVING ROOM BERLINS HOUSE DAY

HELENA sits on the sofa Shes a lousy liar and having a tough

time with the phone my aunt called twice well soon I
hope so right now Im scared to be there who just a
second OK just a second Goodridge wants the number

She seeks decision from BERLIN who doesnt want him to have it

HELENA (Phone)
Mr Goodridge I cant find it
No theres no one here to read
it right now Well yes I know
of course I will yes promise
Ill get it and call you tomorrow

And thats it except for Goodbyes He takes the phone and re-
places it Her expression is a toss up between guilt and anxiety

I feel really bad about it coz
they invited me for Christmas

BERLIN
Has he got your aunts address

HELENA
I dont think so He said the
police had been calling want-
ed to ask me some more questions

BERLIN

Probably Angelo Ill take
care of it Dont worry we-
re gonna find this guy and
everythingll be OK OK

Only thing he fails to mention is which guy hes talking about
Anyway the subject is already changed He notices tapes in her
bag Would you like me to put your music on No she doesnt
want music OK Hes gonna light the fire and make them lunch

99 EXT WOODSHED BERLINS HOUSE DAY

BERLIN is splitting logs and HELENA is sitting an a step watch-
ing him Shes looking almost happy with only worry in the way

BERLIN
Youre looking worried again Helena

HELENA
No Im not

BERLIN
Youre looking more worried now than
when you decided to stop worrying

HELENA
Alright Im worried about Christmas
I wish I hadnt told him Id be back

A log tangents off BERLIN retrieves it Tosses it in a barrow

BERLIN
Hell get over it Ill roast

les around it How about that

A distant owl hoots She knows hes smiling Shes smiling too
HELENA
Wouldnt it be better if I cook

90 INT LIVING ROOM HOUSE NIGHT

The Music is Puccini Part oneAct twoThe Humming Chorus from
Madam Butterfly Giant close of the spinning cassette The Cam-
era remains close as it explores the room Candle light and fire-
light Along a mantlepiece Eleven thirty-five on a clock Two
Christmas cards Several photographs from the happy years One
a picture of Ross and Berlin in uniform Another features Berlin
with his arm around a beautiful young lady with long dark hair
For a moment it could be Helena But the Cameras already gone

HELENA cuddles knees in the corner of a sofa Looks considerab-
ly more relaxed But theres a tension here and both are aware
of it Stifled yawns She stares at him and BERLIN stares back
A billion people in love have been through this Its bed-time
A suggestion of Berlins bed to be is heaped in pillowsblank-
ets at the end of the couch Come on Ill take you up there
She finds his hand and stands The Music follows them upstairs

91 INT BEDROOM HOUSE NIGHT

Moonlight through the windows They are silhouettes They want
to embrace but in a situation like this a bedroom is the worst
place to be No sound except the Music And whats anyone supp-
osed to say This atmosphere is about kissing and nothing more

Christ hear this Music A sweet pulse of Puccini Big close of
lips meeting in moonlight Now in each others arms They kiss
And then theyre kissing And nothing else is happening in the
whole fucking universe except a telephone just started to ring

Still ringing Still kissing Somebody has got to give in The
phone finally gets answered The voice at the end isnt expect-
ed But BERLIN sounds pleased to hear it It seems one problem
got solved I gotta tell you Margie You are Mrs Santa Claus

92 INTEXT KITCHENREAR ENTRANCE ROSSS HOUSE DAY

Is Ross throwing a party or opening a bar Crates of booze and
stack upon stack of beer A bit of where do you want it act-
ing from BERLIN as he staggers in with a delivery of Bud ROSS
makes room on a table Rips a beer out the plastic and pops it

BERLIN
Cant thank you enough Ross

ROSS
Dont thank me Thank Margie

Swallowing beer ROSS exits the back door with BERLIN following
Its her invitation And as

far as Citrine in concerned
better we keep it like that
The wagon waits outside with a few crates left to unload BER-
LIN heads for his Mercedes with ROSS calling after him John
Here Pulls a six pack from his supplies and throws it across

Theres an old desperado in
one of the cells Why dont
you give him this and tell
him happy Christmas from me

93 INT BEDROOM THE ROSS RESIDENCE DAY

The Girls prepare for festivity They got a full length mirror
A wardrobe of dresses A menu of shoes What they do with them
in this scene is their affair Right now MARGIEs holding some
blue number in front of HELENAIts blue silk You like blue

MARGIE
Not you blue This isnt you

She slings the dress on the bed It joins a pile of rehearsals
Moves deeper into her dresses and HELENA appears in the mirror

HELENA
When did John divorce

MARGIE
Two or three years ago

HELENA
What was she like

MARGIE
Suzanne Very pretty She was a semi-
professional model But a policemans
wife she wasnt So one day she just
packed it and left And his whole life
went straight down the nearest toilet

HELENA
What does that mean

MARGIE
You know he crashed He just couldnt
come to terms with it John hates to
lose and he hated losing her Every
spare minute hes driving down to San
Diego having a terrible time with her
getting drunk and driving back you
just dont believe the amount he drank

She pirouettes with black sequins What do you think of black
Evidently not much and MARGIE is getting short of alternatives
Wait a minute I just had
the most brilliant idea

HELENA
You think he still loves her

MARGIE
Think he still thinks about her But
not like then Then was an obsession

She emerges from the wardrobe with red satin high heeled shoes

Here try these if these
fit we got the perfect dress

HELENA
I havent worn heels since I was 16
I dont think I could walk in these

MARGIE
Sure you can Anyway parties
are all about standing still

HELENA is excited to try them out The experiment is a success

Ill go get the dress Its kinda
sultry I only wore it once coz
in reality I cant get away with it

HELENA
You think John would like it

MARGIE
I think John would love it

94 EXT HOUSE NIGHT

The Ross residence looks like an ad for JandB Warm yellow light
from the windows Holly wreath on the front door The Mercedes
pulls up and BERLIN gets out with his bag and suit on a hanger
A hard wind around the house He walks inside without knocking

95 INT DEN HOUSE NIGHT

The den looks like a little museum Walls decorated with Civil
War memorabilia One wall occupied by a cabinet of modern guns
ROSS looks like Roy Rogers trying to look like Fred Astaire A
powder blue evening suit Ho dumps ice in a barrel full of Bud-
wieser and BERLIN produces a couple of presents This is from
Helena And this is from me The first obviously a music tape
ROSS holds it to his ear Sounds like Frank Sinatra And the
second a bottle of (Ross tears the wrappings off) Chivas Regal

ROSS
Lets do one of these right now
then well hide the sonovabitch

But hes already lost BERLINs attention MARGIE walks in with
HELENA Jesus what have you done to her Bright red lipstick and
jet black mascara and dress made of blood red sequins Sexy it
is but her it isnt She looks like one of those big tit dopes
from Tennessee She also looks like 37 million dollars Christ
that smile works with paint An appraisal comes from ROSS Wow

96 INT LIVING ROOM HOUSE NIGHT

The whole house is going around in a haze of booze and colored
lights and laughter Buddy Holly supplies the music True Love
Ways and ROSS is a victim of the nostalgia Dances close with
MARGIE Among the kaleidoscope of passing couples are HELENA and
BERLIN Eyes closed and oblivious of everything but each other

But someone is staring at them About forty years old with big
hands Too old for acne but the skin is bad Got a scar on his
cheek like a ladder in a stocking He continues to stare until
the dancers separate Music ends and hes already in the crowd

BERLIN arrives with a whisper for MARGIE and next thing HELENA
is on her arm heading for the stairs Obviously a ladies room
run Everly Brothers next record up and SERATO appears through
the crush Spots ROSS who wants to know What happened to you

SERATO
Duty Sergeant fucked up can
you believe it Im on tonight
How long have you got One big drink And they head for it

Did you get my message

BERLIN
No

SERATO
I left a message on your machine

It wasnt me calling Sam around

This last question to ROSS who delivers a typically large shot

ROSS
Yeah I guess shes in the kit-
chen We got a so-called prof-

essional cook out there having a
nervous breakdown over a turkey

BERLIN
Are you sure you didnt call

SERATO
I spoke to old whass-his-name
a couple of times But not to
her and I never asked for her

ROSS
Her who

BERLIN
Someones calling the institute
to talk to Helena Says he wants
to ask her some more questions

SERATO
Not guilty

And he pushes off to see his wife BERLIN looks around worried

BERLIN
You got a quiet phone somewhere

ROSS
Hey John dont start getting
antsy over this tonight It may
well have been the local cops

BERLIN
Thats just what I wanna find out

97 INT BATHROOM HOUSE NIGHT

MARGIE fixes HELENAs lips Big on the lipstick Another layer
of magenta is going on Are you sure I look OK Her question
interrupts the Revlon Youre the prettiest girl here by about
two hundred per cent MARGIE moves in again for the lower lip

MARGIE
How you doing on those shoes

HELENA
Dont mix very well with beer

Perhaps she is a tiny bit tipsy MARGIE smiles and says Press
MARGIE

Girl like you should be drinking
chill white wine Press All done
A knock on the door Come in and BOBBY sticks his head inside

BOBBY
That woman in the kitchen says
if she doesnt get help within
10 seconds shes gonna resign

MARGIE
That woman is a disaster

She turns to the mirror in exasperation and mends her own face

Alright tell her Im coming No
wait a minute honey Take Helena
for me and find John And dont
let go of her hand until you do

INT LIVING ROOMDEN HOUSE NIGHT

A pause in the Music amplifies conversation Bullshit and beer
and everyone talking about nothing BOBBY leads HELENA through
the row Cant find Berlin and now theyre in the den The ser-
ious Guzzlers have made it base Everyone talking and everyone
lying but no Berlin and BOBBY is about to make a major mistake

BOBBY
Ill just go see if hes in the
kitchen you stay right here

Her protest is absorbed in sound And anyway hes already gone
At once she is vulnerable Doesnt know if shes staring at the
back of a head or straight into someones face Didnt we meet
somewhere The question comes from the man with the scar Hes
drunk as a dog and already got a tattooed hand around her waist

VENABLES
Hey Popeye

POPEYE
Hey Fat Guy Gimme 2 minutes Im
about to ask this lady for a dance

Trash aftershave and lousy breath and clearly the answer is no

If I told you Id driven all the way
from Oakland would you dance with me

Willy Nelson starts to sing And HELENA attempts to break away

Whats so special about the other guy
You like cops dont you Im a cop
HELENA finds the top of a couch Holds it like a raft of secur-
ity But where ever she goes this frightful mouth is following

let me ask you a question How do
you know the difference between one
guy and another Maybe you dont
Maybe you only know the difference
when youre dancing (he laughs) If
you knew what I looked like youd
dance with me I look like John Wayne

HELENA
I know what you look like Excuse me

She navigates the back of the sofa Collides with somebody and
apologizes Im sorry Is anyone sitting there Enough ambiv-
alence in the question for the guy not to know shes blind No
No one sitting there Simultaneously a pair of middle-age crew
cuts occupy the sofa A second later HELENA sits bang into one
of the laps Spilt drinks and surprise all round Pleasant sur-
prise for the victim Hes a lecherous looking old bastard and
Helenas dress rides up for a damned good view of the lingerie

FLESHY VOICE
Happy Christmas Max

MAX
I normally get socks

Every humiliation there is However HELENA gets out of this is
however she achieves it But by the time she does shes crying

99 INT HALLWAYSTAIRS HOUSE NIGHT

A calm spot between kitchen and stairs In the background Guests
raid the kitchen for food BERLIN looks like he should be smok-
ing a cigarette At last MARGIE comes downstairs with the news

MARGIE
She wants to go back
to the institute
ROSS already arrived BERLIN looks desolate She cant go back

You better go talk to her

ROSS watches him walk upstairs His eyes an assessment of this
absurd relationship All sorts of people fall in love Darlin

ROSS
I know aint it a shame
100 INT BEDROOM HOUSE NIGHT

A wedge of light as BERLIN walks in Then moonlight again HEL-
ENA sits at the edge of a single bed Hair a wreck and mascara
streaks down her face He sits identifying himself with an emb-
race Clears the hair from her eyes and kisses where the tears
were It was an accident everyone has accidents Whatever
he said would be the wrong thing to say Because he doesnt un-
derstand And her only explanation of this misery is new tears

HELENA
I cant walk in these shoes

Gently he reaches down and takes off her shoos You dont have
to dress like this for me And suddenly the mood is different
He is amongst her tears Kissing her mouth Already undressing
her Her dress glides up Silk stockings He unclips them She
feels his hands drift down her legs Hears the zip opening her
dress She returns his desire and helps him with her brassiere
He kisses her breasts and by now the Cameras too close to see

101 INT BEDROOM HOUSE NIGHT

HELENA asleep in BERLINs arms Just the worry of the wind He
isses her and slips out of bed and everything slams into MASS-
IVE CLOSE-UP PLUS A MASSIVE AMPLIFICATION OF SOUND THE SLIDE
SNAPS BACK ON A 9 MILL BERETTA THE MAGAZINE SHUNTS OUT SLUGS
LOADED AND MAG BACK IN THE SLIDE TRAVELS FORWARD BIG AS A CAR

BERLIN is fully dressed Geared up for work Black leather glo-
ves and black leather jacket Shoves the Beretta into his belt
From somewhere a very soft sound of Christmas carols drifts in

102 INT STAIRSLIVING ROOMDEN HOUSE NIGHT

This is deep past midnight The house is quiet and gone to bed
Fallout from the party everywhere Still that distant sound of
carols BERLIN dumps his bag and walks into the den Just dark-
ness and the forgotten tape machine Flips on a lamp and tries
to open the gun cabinet Still trying when startled by a voice

ROSS (0S)
You cant get in there
Thats Comanche Proof

BERLIN swings round in surprise ROSS is half asleep on a sofa

BERLIN
Jesus What are you doin

ROSS
I spose Im drinking myself to
sleep Its Helenas Christmas
songs theyre really pretty

Silent Night Holy Night and about two inches of Chivas left

BERLIN
Have you got any Glasers
(Ross does)
Twenty fives

BERLIN sticks a foot on a table Pulls a 25 Walther automatic
from an ankle holster Ejects the mag and clicks out the slugs

ROSS
What exactly you doing John

BERLIN
Im going up to the institute

ROSS
Now

BERLIN
This cop thats calling thinks
she gonna be there over Christmas

ROSS unlocks a cabinet and BERLIN is about to load the Glasers

I checked with the locals and our
station no ones called Whoever
it is isnt the police I think
this bastards getting worried ab-
out something and I think the-
res just a chance hell turn up

ROSS
Well lets hope he does

ROSS selects a 12 gauge Winchester and rams the mechanism open

And if he does Im gonna
drop a bomb on the fukker

BERLIN
Listen you dont havta come

ROSS
Hey

ROSS is stuffing solid lead car killers into the pump action
Watch my lips Im your partner
103 EXT SHASTA-TRINITY INSTITUTE NIGHT

This is probably a crane shot A gale works up the valley The
institute is in total darkness Not a vehicle out front Not a
sound except the marauding wind Rosss Chevrolet is concealed
amongst trees Been here long enough to allow slow flurries to
accumulate It stares towards the building maybe 75 yards away

104 INT CHEVROLET SEDAN NIGHT

BERLIN wears a black wool hat ROSS a big black overcoat Both
got shit frozen out of them A bottle available and anyone who
wants a slug better help himself Plus sleet on the windshield
and a lot of stale time BERLIN asks what time it is And ROSS
takes a heave on the booze and waits for about a week to go by

ROSS
Wheres your watch

BERLIN
I guess by the bed

ROSS
Its twenty of three

Yawns do a circuit ROSS flops in his seat and the angle chang-
es The view from the rear covers windscreen and back of heads

A little young for you Bro
(Gets his eyes)

You think if she could see

shed be hanging around with

an old dog like you You got

a stomach growing around to

meet itself behind your back

BERLIN

Bull shit Im in my prime
ROSS

Bits
BERLIN

What dyou mean bits
A star-light on the windshield Distant and nobody seen it yet
ROSS

Policemens bodies age at diff-
erent rates Look at me Gut in
its fifties Balls in their six-
ties And feet in their eighties

BERLIN
Hit those wipers Ross

Urgency snaps him into close-up Big noise as wipers clear the
screen I thought I saw a light BERLIN stares at the instit-
ute through small binoculars There Flashlight went right ac-
ross those windows Instant excitement as the adrenalin pumps
in Fourth floor See it Hes fucken in there And suddenly
everything including super-sinister Music is happening at once

105 EXT CHEVROLET INSTITUTE NIGHT

Pines singing as the gale tears into them Clutching his Winch-
ester ROSS opens the trunk A dim light and a fluster of equip-
ment BERLIN sorts out a pair of radios Selects a channel and
ROSS whispers What are you on (local Tac) Here come huge
12 cell flashlights and the intense whispers continue Local

ROSS
What if we need a back up

BERLIN
Were not here I dont
want the desk to hear us

OK its channel 4 and copy And theyre already on their way
106 EXT BACK OF BUILDING INSTITUTE NIGHT

The storm bullies its way around the building Lights approach
quickly But one of them is already fading It belongs to ROSS
This fuckers got about 5 minutes in it And whatever the plan
was it just got changed BERLIN looks around in apprehension -
going in there alone aint no joy - his flashlight ascends the
fire escape And there it is 2 floors up A half opened window

BERLIN
Alright Ill start at
the top and work down

ROSS
You aint going in alone

BERLIN
Thats a liability Ross I
dont want you hanging on to
my shirt Anyone but me comes
down these stairs take em out
but try and keep him alive I
want this bastard living

Takes off up the stairs ROSS watches him vanish (Waiting out
here aint so tasty either) The wind rages in nearby trees A
door slams repeatedly somewhere a long way away Ross 102
Im going in Big on ROSS and the radio You take care Bro

107 INT REAR STAIRWELL INSTITUTE NIGHT

BERLIN climbs through the window Drops down and waits to orien-
tate himself Hes on a small landing midway between flights of
stairs Different kinds of noises in here One hundred per cent
more sinister Ross Ross You hearing me 102 Im going
upstairs Snaps the safety-catch on his Beretta And it sounds
ominous Every shadow in this place is animated with foreboding

108 INT STAIRWELLCORRIDOR INSTITUTE NIGHT

Looking down the stairwell The light comes up BERLIN arrives
on another floor Hard to sweat in here but hes doing it His
progress is distinctly cautious A harsh wind rockets down the
stairs flapping a pair of owing doors BERLIN eases through in-
to the corridor At its far end is the elevator He travels to-
wards it in an eerie piston of light John Whats happening

109 EXT REAR OF INSTITUTE NIGHT

ROSS has moved into the shelter of a wall Sleet passes almost
horizontally His flashlight is over The color of a tangerine

ROSS BERLIN

Im on Helenas floor Im
just gonna take a look at her
apartment You OK Fucken
flashlights kaput Doors
locked shit Whats happen-
ing Brother I can hear some-
thing Something upstairs

110 INT CORRIDOR INSTITUTE NIGHT

BERLIN stares up at the coiling I can hear footsteps right
up above They disappear into the gale Doors beat at the end
of the corridor He moves towards them and pushes out onto the
stairway Nothing but the wind Hes about to climb when an al-
arming voice shocks him rigid YOU ARE NOW ON THE THIRD FLOOR

BERLIN is already running Light swinging wildly as he sprints

back up the corridor Fifteen yards to elevatorstairs Breath-
less as hell he hits the radio Fuckers in the elevator Al-
most jumps stairs in haste Bursts out onto the 3rd floor Ham-
mer back on the Beretta Just in time to see the doors closing
Get ready Ross He maybe coming down But he isnt Hes go-
ing up By the time hes recovered breath the Voice is back in
business Whoever rides the elevator is now on the fifth floor

111 INT STAIRWELL INSTITUTE NIGHT

Totally breathless now Eyes ascend faster than feet Whine of
a swinging door BERLIN rounds the stairwell The doors still
busy Top of the building here and the ceilings are closing in

BERLINS POV as he heads for that door Closer Three steps
to go Closer Two steps more One step Reaches for it Whamm
The door smashes into him like it hates him So fast it hardly
happened He staggers back His flashlight clatters downstairs

Banisters capsize as the light passes Every shadow goes crazy
The flashlight arrives at a lower level Rolls away and stops
Wastes power into a corner Cant see Berlin and cant see his
radio But Ross cuts into the silence with increasing disquiet

John John Are you al-
right Come in John

112 EXT REAR OF INSTITUTEFIRE ESCAPE NIGHT

ROSS savaged by the gale In considerable anxiety Less than a
volt in his batteries His failure to contact Berlin accelerat-
es his concern by the moment Calls repeatedly You hearing me

Big close on the radio Fingers switch channels Tries calling
on fivesix Still nothing and goes to channel eight Come in
John Alright fuck it Light or no light Hes going up there
Still calling he barges at the wind making for the fire escape

You hear me Just be care-
ful now coz Im coming up

Stares up into the gloom of the iron stairs Hardly got a foot
on the first before a Figure rushes down Dressed in black and
very breathless A powerful flashlight floods on dazzling ROSS

Is that you John Ans-
wer NOW Or I blow this

fucken staircase to pieces

BERLIN
Me Freddy

Thank Jesus the anxietys over The 12 gauge drops to his side

ROSS
What the hells going on up there
Brother I been calling 10 minutes

The light remains steady and blinding and straight in his face
Hey cmon John Talk to me

Just the sound of breathlessness Plus a 25 Walther automatic
Jesus Christ What are you doing

It glints at the peripheries of his vision and ROSS is alarmed

What the fuck are you doing - Its
me - Holy shit - John - John - Not
you - Dont shoot you crazy bastard

Two deathly flashes in quick succession The first practically
taken Rosss hand off The second slams into his guts and hes
down The Glaser is unequalled in ferocity by any other bullet

113 EXT FIRE ESCAPE (ATTIC LEVEL) INSTITUTE NIGHT

The MYOPIC JANITOR looks down Five floors below a man lays on
his back His shotgun discharges uselessly into trees Another
man leans over him Illuminates his agonized face with a flash-
light Shoots him again point-blank in the upper body The MYO-
PIC isnt staying for more Hurries back along the fire escape

114 INT ATTIC APARTMENT INSTITUTE NIGHT

Wind breaks on the roof like waves An utterly dismal room lit
by a starving light bulb The MYOPIC arrives from the fire esc-
ape Huge eyes behind those orb-like glasses Picks up a phone
and dials Piles and piles of old newspapers Hundreds of fuck
magazines In the kitchen section a mass of photographic equip-
ment includes an enlarger on the table a flash camera On the
wall behind him a collage of snaps of half dressed girls Plus
a special enlargement of Helena standing naked in her bathroom

MYOPIC
Gimme the police Quickly

115 EXT REAR OF INSTITUTE FIRE ESCAPE NIGHT

Close on a bulb in a flashlight The merest glimmer of energy
Barely the light to see the blood It seeps into a long-frozen
footprint in the ice Fills it fast and expands over the sides

Somebody say this cant be happening BERLIN crumples to knees
in the snow Dumps his light gasping for breath Oblique light
creating desperate silhouettes BERLIN howls like a dog Howls
into his radio Nine - Nine - Nine Blood all over his hands
This is a Nine - Nine - Nine - officer down ROSS is heaving
like an old bull elephant On the verge of unconsciousness He
tries to speak Got hit in the throat BERLIN fights off tears

Dont talk old man Repeats the emergency code but this time
he cant be heard Almost imperceptibly a Carol filters in (In
The Bleak Mid Winter) and the Camera moves slowly away BERLIN
cradles ROSSs tragic head and the song drowns the raging wind

This beautiful Christmas carol will articulate rhythm of these

116 EXT CITY STREET CITY HOSPITAL NIGHT

A blue emergency light Revolving in slow motion Like a dream
The city streets are a blur The light accelerates into sudden
reality Ambulance plus police convoy speed to a city hospital

118 INT WAITING AREA HOSPITAL NIGHT

Outside in the corridor Looking in at BERLIN He sits head in
hands on a bench This is somebodys point of view The camera
travels up the windows Waits at a distance as CITRINE arrives
Pajamas under his clothes He walks with assistance of a stick

Neither say anything because both know what this is about BER-
LIN stands and hands over his badge Exits the mag and now his
Beretta A brief word from CITRINE and he turns and walks away

119 EXT LANDSCAPE BERLINS HOUSE DAWN

A little house in winter meadows Kind of pretty now its pain-
ted Just the first tint of pink on its roof The Carol dissol-
ves into birdsong Here comes the sun for a fine Christmas day

120 EXT VERANDA HOUSE DAWN

All new paint and all new things in expectation of happy times
A barbecue still in polythene wraps Price tag and unconnected
gas pipe shift gently in the breeze A brand now swinging seat

BERLIN sits in it with shock wearing on Expressionless of sor-
row Though he suffers every sorrow and guilt and regret there
is Sunlight reaches the veranda and colors the end of it red
silent and motionless he watches the lousiest dawn of his life
121 EXTINT THE ROSS RESIDENCE LIVING ROOM DAY

Lights glow on the Christmas tree Unopened presents still und-
erneath SERATO sits smoking in silence Listens to a sound of
plates getting stacked in another room He looks up but not in
surprise He just wasnt aware BERLIN had arrived in the house

BERLIN
Wheres Margie

Stunned and stubbled and full of grief And thats just SERATO

SERATO
Taken Bobby to her sisters

This atmosphere is unbearable and even these whispers seem laud
They were going there anyway

BERLIN
Does he know

SERATO shakes his head Loses his cigarette And SAMMY appears

SERATO
Thinks his dads in hospital

SAMMY SERATO is 30 and pretty She continues collecting plates
Whyd you go up there John

Knows hes not going to get a reply and doesnt bother to wait

for it HELENA materializes from the den like a shadow Sallow

for want of sleep and glad to have BERLINs hand to hang on to

BERLIN
I want you to go to your Aunts

A suggestion that surprises HELENA And clearly doesnt appeal

HELENA
Why cant I stay with you

BERLIN
Its not possible right now

HELENA
Why

BERLIN
Please dont ask no quest-
ions now Not right now

If silence can intensify its now Sound of the front door and
then footsteps BERLIN freezes as MARGIE appears Wracked with
grief Dead sickness of tears Like she cried bones out of her
face But no weeping now Maybe shock Maybe brave Maybe both

The strongest face

HELENA
Is that Margie

MARGIE
Im here honey Im right here

in the house And now HELENA is in her arms

Dont cry darlin he was a big
old cop and he didnt like tears

Dead echos of plates in the kitchen And song of birds outside

Raises her hand to

Feels like every second in my life
was just the moment leading to this

BERLIN
Margie

MARGIE
Dont

silence him and this is silence Margie owns

Dont

122 INT BEDROOM BERLINS HOUSE NIGHT

The Camera will slowly crane down on BERLIN Fully dressed but
wiped out he lays an the bad Last thing he needs is booze He
is clearly full of it Drifting in and out of consciousness A
nightmare either side of the line He relives that night again
And Ross is alive again as guilt and regret demand to be heard

(ROSS)
You want me to make a predict-
ion This guy aint turning up

(BERLIN)
Maybe not What time is it

(ROSS)
Twenty-six minutes past two

(BERLIN)

(ROSS)

in time for Bobbys presents

A memory that is too terrible to bear BERLIN gets up and sits
at the edge of the bad Head in hands Wants the pain to go aw-
ay But anguish is stronger than alcohol Hears noises outside
and makes it to a window Tears curtains back revealing lights
His Mercedes hangs in space as though staring into the bedroom

123 EXT FRONT YARD HOUSE NIGHT

St Annes ASSISTANT sucks a pencil Busy with a cross-word puz-â€”
zle Fills in a word but the Camera isnt interested It moves
away to discover head phones And moves closer to hear St ANNE

Always figured Id like to retire
to a little town like this - maybe

126 INT INTERROGATION ROOM POLICE STATION DAY

A change of chairs A wood chair for the subject Mobile chair
for the man Castors give him considerable freedom Enable him
to back off or move in with the intimacy of an ophthalmologist

St ANNE
You fish John

BERLIN
I have done

A side table features several pin sharp pencils A Sony pocket
recorder Two packets of Pall Mall reds Two yellow legal pads
The chair moves into reverse and he breaks a puke colored file

St ANNE
Alright lets not beat about the
bush what ever that may mean and
get down on it You were specific-
ally instructed by your chief not
to go anywhere near the blind inst-
itute So why did you go up there

BERLIN
Because of a feeling I had a bad
feeling this man was gonna turn up

St ANNE
Which man is that

BERLIN
The man I detail in my report Sir

The report thats in his hands (St Anne knows well which man)

Is this an interview or an
interrogation

St ANNE
Its an enquiry
BERLIN
Im not prepared to be interrog-
ated Ill be interviewed as an
officer who may be expected to
cooperate with the investigator

St ANNE
Well thats fine by me John And
Im sure thats fine by your Chief

He smiles the non-smile Tosses his pencil down And sits back
So you thought your man might show

BERLIN
Yes

St ANNE
Bit of a long-shot wasnt it

BERLIN
It was the only shot I had

St ANNE
So the one night you decide to
go up there he goes up there

BERLIN
Thats right Except Id decid-
ed to go up there every night

St ANNE
Despite the wishes of your Chief

BERLIN
Yes

St ANNE
You were prepared to fal-
sify your reports to him

BERLIN
I had very good reasons for do

St ANNE
Just a second John I knew
there was something missing

St ANNE cuts him off to pick up the phone Obviously something
vital is needed Could you bring an an ashtray in here Got a
coupla guys who smoke in here And attention back to the file
You dont mind if I jump around a
little this morning do you Just
while Im easing my way into this

BERLIN
Youre asking the questions Sir

St ANNE
You had an argument with Ross Ass-
aulted one of the officers right

BERLIN
I wouldnt use the word assault

St ANNE

You got a racy temper

Sergeant
BERLIN
Not especially

St ANNE
Just something they did on this
occasion made you lose your rag

BERLIN
Not they He Taylor put a piece
in the newspaper which in my op-
inion put my witness in jeopardy

St ANNE
From whom

BERLIN
From the man I detail in my rep-
ort A crazy man who to my cert-â€”
ain knowledge has killed at least
eight girls Six in San Diego one
someplace else and one up here

St ANNE
Not a lotta support for that
scenario though is there

BERLIN
Not a lot

St ANNE
Not even from Ross

BERLIN
No
St ANNE
Is that why you lost your temper with
him Frustration No one believing you

His ASSISTANT brings the ashtray And St ANNE smiles gratitude
So what can you tell me about you man

BERLIN
What do you mean Sir

St ANNE
I mean who is he

BERLIN
I dont know who he is Whos
Jack The Ripper Hes Jack
The Ripper with an automobile

St ANNE
You didnt run a profile

BERLIN
No Sir I didnt have the res-
ources and it isnt my expertise

St ANNE
This crazy man What makes you think
he wants to eliminate Miss Robertson

BERLIN
You read my report Sir

St ANNE
Im asking a question

BERLIN
Because he reads Im investigating
the disappearance of her friend and
Miss Robertson becomes the focus of
his anxiety How good of a witness
is she Hes crazy but not stupid
hes intelligent Got a flexible M
O and he doesnt wanna get caught

St ANNE
Just like Jack The Ripper

This is meant to humiliate and meant to annoy and it does both

Alright well have plenty of time
to discuss your Mystery Man and
his flexibility later Right now
Id like to talk about the event

127 INT ANTI ROOMINTERROGATION POLICE STATION DAY

CITRINE rests on his cane staring through the one-way glass A
menu of anxieties But perhaps sadness is his principal expres-
sion His eyes slide to the ASSISTANT Can you turn that thing
on Glad to oblige and Voices cut in This is CITRINES POV

St ANNE BERLIN
Alright the door comes back and
hits you Knocks you down Knocks
you out For how long I dont
know Approximately you figure
A minute OK OK then what
happened Immediately you get up

128 INT INTERROGATION ROOM POLICE STATION DAY

BERLIN
I realized the flashlight was
at the bottom of the stairs

St ANNE
Did you check your weapon

BERLIN
Maybe It would have been
instinctive All I know was
I was in possession of it

St ANNE
You didnt check it

BERLIN
Not that I specifically remember

St ANNE
Why not
BERLIN
I dont know I wasnt think-
ing about it I was dazed
St ANNE

You were woozy Confused

BERLIN
I was unconscious 10 seconds ago

St ANNE
I understand Then

BERLIN
Then I picked up the flashlight
tried to get Ross on the radio
Nothing Static I got blood on
my hand realized my eye was cut

St ANNE
Could you see out of it

BERLIN
Yeah I could see Then I ran
Climbed out of the window ran
down the fire escape and right
at the bottom I found Ross

St ANNE
Were you breathless

BERLIN
Sure I was breathless

St ANNE
When did you realize you were no
longer in possession of the 25

BERLIN
Not until I was in the hospital

St ANNE
You figure you lost it in the
hospital Or on the way there

BERLIN
No I thought it must have
fallen down the stairwell

St ANNE BERLIN
Like the flashlight Yeah Had
you been drinking that night

BERLIN
It was Christmas Eve

St ANNE
That wasnt my question

BERLIN
Yes

St ANNE BERLIN
How about Ross Sure Were
you drinking in the car
There was a bottle in the car

BERLIN
I think Ross had a mouthful

St ANNE
But not you

BERLIN
I may have had a nip

St ANNE
To keep out the cold Very cold
that night very windy wasnt it

St ANNE motors off and refers to notes without looking at BERLIN
Which hand was the flashlight in

BERLIN
My left hand

St ANNE
And the Walther was in your right

BERLIN
The Beretta was in my right hand

St ANNE
You said you didnt check it So how
dyou know which gun youre holding

The chair moves back in and its pilot has an icicle up his ass

You said you figured it had fallen
down the stairs with the flashlight
You said you were confused You pick
up the flashlight in confusion how
dyou know you didnt pick up the 25

BERLIN
Lets not start playing games Mr St Anne

St ANNE
Games

BERLIN
I told you Id lost the Walther

St ANNE
The dead smile and

For the first time

You told me you didnt know youd

lost it until you were in the hos-
pital So if you didnt know till
then it coulda been either weapon

BERLIN
The gun in my hand was a Beretta
And for the record I want that
note corrected Now please Sir

rubber in action St ANNE changes his

St ANNE
OK Im corrected Im
sorry I made a mistake

BERLIN
With respect Sir you didnt make
a mistake I know who you are and
youre far too experienced for mis-
takes Now if you have doubts over
the content or veracity of my rep-
ort I wanna be made aware of them

St ANNE
Sure

BERLIN
I wanna be made aware of them now

St ANNE
Do you want a lawyer Sergeant

BERLIN
There you go again Do I want
a lawyer Sergeant Its a game
question What do I want a law-
yer for I got nothing to hide

St ANNE
You dont

BERLIN
You know I dont So lets quit
the bullshit and get down to it
Whats your angle Mr St Anne

St ANNE moves his chair into BERLINs

St ANNE
Wheres the little gun Sergeant

notes

space
BERLIN
Ive no idea

St ANNE
You dont

BERLIN
If it isnt in the institute
the man who shot Ross took it

St ANNE
The man who shot Ross used it

Implications are ganging up quicker than BERLIN can focus them

And you dont know where that little
twenty-five calibre Walthers gone

BERLIN confirms it Looking very concerned The wheels retreat
St ANNE shakes out a cigarette and takes his time with matches

OK Sergeant here it is I intend to
produce evidence that will prove you
shot Frederick Ross with malice afore-
thought My angle therefore is to pre-
pare a case on behalf of your Chief to
prosecute you for first degree murder

129 INT ADMINISTRATION POLICE STATION DAY

The lights on the Christmas tree are off That just about sums
it up The words out and it talks in barren silence as BERLIN
appears TAYLOR and SERATO in conference at a desk The former

up Like some coffee John Seems like ANN is the only benev-
olent face around She gets a lost smile and bewildered shake of
his head Disappears into his room And quietly closes the door

The Cameras getting closer and so is St ANNE And today there
is a definite change of mood Still very measured Still a pro-
fessional demeanor But a bad sense of shit about to come down

St ANNE
there was a gale that night all
the doors are swinging so this door

swings back and clips you and down
Bit of a cold coming on and near enough for BERLIN to catch it

you go within 35 seconds of uncon-
sciousness youre back on the fire es-
cape and youre confused really con-
fused you dont know if Tuesdays
come in twos or happen once a week

You see a figure coming up the stairs
Ross aint meant to be on the stairs
He challenges you and this aint a
piece of wood with a nail through it

up your nose and hes drunk and
youre dizzy and your eyes fulla
blood you aint thinking good and
youre seeing worse Wow it just
went off You just put him down
and you get hit by a Glaser you stay
down But he aint dead Now you

seconds later you put another one in
his throat Isnt that what happened

BERLIN
No

St ANNE

BERLIN

I already told you what happened

Youre looking for an inconsisten-
cy and youre not gonna find one
because Im telling you the truth

St ANNE

Tell me the truth again

134 EXT TRACKFRONT YARD BERLINS HOUSE DAY

A yellow cab splashes through puddles and pulls up in front of

the house HELENA gets out and pays

No she doesnt need assis-â€”

tance Picks up her suitcase and the cab vanishes into drizzle

135 INT KITCHENLIVING ROOM BERLINS HOUSE DAY

Back door opens and HELENA walks in

First thing she senses is

cold This place smells like it hasnt been lived in since she
was last here And last time she was here she was happy Dumps
her case and heads for the living room Cant see it but feels
the overwhelming gloom Finds a couch and now she sits to wait

The silence is almost total But something disturbs it HELENA
looks around Back on her feet she tries to discover source of
the sound Finally arrives at a table lamp She feels the bulb
and its hot A large moth beats itself crazy inside the shade
Reaches in and turns it off and the house is in virtual darkness

136 INT INTERROGATION ROOM POLICE STATION DAY

St ANNE lights a cigarette Attention with his notes Sniffing
a fair bit Hes acquired a toilet roll to deal with it Occas-
ionally will tear a sheet or two off to blow his nose Glances
at BERLIN You want a cigarette No he doesnt Ive given up

St ANNE
You have How about the booze

How does St ANNE know Perhaps he doesnt Sounds like he does

Too much booze can be very dangerous
memory black outs stuff like that

His attention still with notes like a quack about to prescribe

The Man Takes a Drink Then the Drink
Takes a Drink Then the Drink Takes

the Man Something like that isnt
it Anyway why did you give up

BERLIN
I guess I was drinking too much

St ANNE
I was talking about cigarettes
(Score 10 outta 10)
Find yourself getting breathless

BERLIN
Sure

St ANNE
Specially if youre running Which
floor did the elevator run up to

BERLIN
Five

St ANNE
You ran up to the fifth You must
have been real breathless by then

BERLIN doesnt know where this is going but he doesnt like it

Eyes to BERLIN now

and his smile looks real for the first time

Were gonna get our observer in
here this afternoon Keep an eye
on us (He smiles) Notorious for
withholding information the FBI

St ANNE makes a note Junks the pencil Sits back in his chair

St ANNE breaks off

Were you aware there was a janit-
or in the institute that night

BERLIN
No

St ANNE
You didnt check

BERLIN
There wasnt time

St ANNE
That wasnt my question

BERLIN
No Sir I didnt check

to blow his nose BERLIN looks very worried

St ANNE
Im really catching cold up
here Must be all this fog

BERLIN
Whats the relevance of the janitor

St ANNE
The janitor Let me just ask you
a question - before I forget - do
you take any medication for that

BERLIN
For what

St ANNE
Breathlessness

BERLIN
No
Hits the cigarette

St ANNE
Alright let me answer your question
Whats the relevance of the janitor

like this is the one that caused the cancer

Why dont I take you through it from
where Im sitting At some time bet-
ween 2 and 230 am the janitor thought
he heard a vehicle approaching through
the woods He looks out and sees noth-
ing no lights nothing Figures it must
be hunters Some time later he thought
he heard something else like a door or
a window slam He gets up and between
half past two and a quarter of three he
makes a search - with a flashlight - of
the top 3 floors Finds nothing untoward
and goes back to his apartment in the roof

BERLIN looks grey as sick Knows whats coming And here it is

The flashlight you saw was his The
footsteps you heard were his The
elevator you were chasing up and down
after was empty and is prone to such
activity due to an electrical fault
Apparently it happens frequently dur-
ing gales The gale that was swinging
the door That knocked you down That
confused you so much And here we are
back to where Im sitting You wanna
tell me what really went on that night

It seems St ANNE has effectively destroyed the Serial Killer
scenario Stubs his cigarette and waits for BERLINs response

St ANNE is winning

BERLIN
Two people know I didnt kill
him Mr St Anne Ones me and
the others the man that did

St ANNE
What man

And they both know it And he almost grins
We just dealt with the man

BERLIN
How dyou know the Jan-
itor didnt shoot him

If St ANNE can raise an eyebrow he does By implication BERLIN is
ditching his Killer During this St ANNE rewinds his Sony

Youre telling me its his
flashlight I saw OK he
sees my flashlight And Im
coming up the stairs with a
Beretta in my hand And hes
frightened He hits the door
on me Picks up my gun Hes
running He runs into Ross
and in panic he shoots him

The little Sony snaps to a stop and St ANNE looks at his watch

St ANNE

Not unless he had a gun in one
hand and a phone in the other
he didnt Ross was shot at ex-
actly two fifty-seven am The
janitor put a call through to
the local police at 257 am
You obviously realize how I can
get so accurate with my timing

St ANNE backs off and carefully replaces the Sony on the table

Ross switched into channel 8 and
we got a recording of the whole
incident I was gonna play it to
you but I got a meeting well
have to do it after lunch Its
one lets make it back by three

137 INT BEDROOM BERLINS HOUSE DAY

HELENA is curled up under blankets Maybe day-dreaming but not
asleep Shes maybe here to keep warm as much as anything else
Sound of a vehicle approaching and she sits to listen The car
pulls up and its engine silences HELENA is already out of bed

138 INT LIVING ROOMPORCHFRONT YARD HOUSE DAY

Silhouette of a figure outside the front door Someone rattles
the handle but its locked And by the time HELENA reaches the
door the visitor has gone Thinking its Berlin she twists the
key and steps onto the porch A stale winter fog settling down

Hardly a sound except her own voice John Is that you Just
the rattle of local Crows and a Bull heaving somewhere in some
distant field John She cautiously descends wood stairs and
walks two or three paces before bumping into a brown Chevrolet

Exploration of the car establishes nil More confused than con-
cerned she listens Country sound and not a sound out of place

Then suddenly she is alert Something clatters somewhere Like
cans kicked in the garage Was it the garage John is it you

139 INT KITCHENLIVING ROOMBEDROOM HOUSE DAY

HELENA locks the front door Moves into the kitchen Locks the
back door Glum silence in the house Nothing but an old alarm
clock ticking Then a sound like something moving Like a door
creaking open Was it in the garage The living room Upstairs

She returns to the living room Curtains drawn and almost dark
The endless silence is interrupted by a rush of water in pipes
If anybodys here theyre upstairs HELENA moves to the bottom
of them John are you up there Its me darling I got a cab

The only reply is more silence She begins to climb the stairs

One hand on the wall She ascends slowly Her helplessness giv-
ing way to suspicion with each new step At the top she pushes
into the bedroom John are you here Darling Are you alright

Apparently no one is here Certainly no one in the bed And no
one in the bathroom She reappears with an expression suppress-â€”
ing anxiety Feels her way past an antique wardrobe Curiously
its door is open A full length mirror inside Shuts it as she
passes and for a split-instant the Man in the room is revealed

Almost simultaneously fingers in black leather clasp her wrist
HELENA in speechless with shock Both she and the INTRUDER are
breathing hard The only other sound is the wardrobe door whin-
ing open again under its weight Manifests a reflection of his
back Totally in black Black wool hat Leather jacket Gloves

INTRUDER
Got really fucken lucky didnt ya

He backs her to the bed and sits her before releasing his grip
The frame remains static and staring into the mirror and still
on the INTRUDERs back HELENA stares unseeing at her own face

I was getting kinda concerned about
you Jenny Like how blind are you
Blind as your friend Or less blind
Coz she could see you know Had a

view outta one of em But you dont
see nothing do you Nothing at all
He reaches into his jeans and produces a stainless steel knife

Even closed this thing is 10 inches long A leather loop attat-

ched at one and He teases the metal in front of HELENAs eyes
Can you see this blind girl

Not a switch-blade but by snapping it like a whip it locks out
Gimme your hand

Too terrified to obey and her inability momentarily angers him

Gimme your fucken hand

HELENA lifts her hand and he takes it He runs the edge of the
blade over her palm Then closes her fingers around the handle

You like it
She is paralyzed except for the tears spilling down her cheeks

I cut your friends
head off with that

Words come out she can barely hear herself You are a coward
You say something Jenny
In this terrible silence she hears a double hiss of an aerosol

Id like to cut you Id like to

cut you so bad But aint life
strange Youre my little buddy
now I guess we all got lucky

140 EXT CAR PARK POLICE STATION CITY OF EUREKA DAY

Fog and dusk in that order Headlights descend the slope Park
and CITRINE plus cane get out As he crosses the lot a Uniform
fires up a Harley Next face is SERATO heading for his car He
accosts the Chief with a piece of paper It is read with escal-
ating incredulity This would be comic if it wasnt so serious

SERATO
Shes in love with him
Chief and try anything

CITRINE
Are you going up there

SERATO
No I just sent Travis
Ive got a call to make

CITRINE
What about the man Has he
seen this No he hasnt

141 INT ANTI ROOMINTERROGATION POLICE STATION DAY

CITRINE walks in in his overcoat BISLEY looks across from the
window And the ASSISTANT up from a crossword Are they busy

ASSISTANT
No Sir they just got back

CITRINE
Would you ask Mr St Anne
to come in here a moment

The ASSISTANT does it via phone And BISLEY looks over unhappy

BISLEY
I hear Ive been nominated
as an official observer

CITRINE
Its either you or Taylor

BISLEY
He dont wanna do it either

CITRINE
Ill toss a coin for you But
one of you is going in today

St ANNE comes in blowing his nose CITRINE shoves him the mess
age He reads it with similar incredulity (but perhaps a touch
more amusement than Citrine) What dyou wanna do with it Sir
What do you wanna do with it
St ANNE
Let him have it I dont

mind putting a little salt
at the edge of his plate

142 EXT FRONT YARD BERLINS HOUSE DUSK

A single light in a downstairs room The house is stifled with
fog A brown police Chevy parked out front Here comes another
to join it As BERLIN gets out SERATO appears on the porch He
descends stairs with the impartial expression of a working cop

BERLIN
I need a friend Angelo

SERATO keeps it dispassionate Ignores BERLINs desperate eyes

SERATO
You got one

Puts a thumb towards the house and already heading for his oar

Shes a bad witness John
But a fucking lousy alibi

143 INT LIVING ROOM HOUSE NIGHT

This isnt a good place to be A dismal lamp supplies light A
close-up Of HELENA on the sofa Hears a sound of booze getting
poured But nothing else in the house except for a harsh voice

BERLIN (0S)

I know why you did it darlin
but youre not helping me Every-
thing theyre hearing they think
is a lie Now here comes the man
Im desperate to prove exists and
whadda-ya-know he turns up at my
house and has a chat with you

By now BERLIN and his glass of anaesthetic are well into frame

No one in the State of California
is gonna believe that They got the
man in there - an A1 FBI inter-
rogator and hes taking me to pie-
ces - doesnt believe a word comes
outta my head - not a word - no one
believes me - I dont believe me

HELENA
Dont say that Dont you dare
say that I believe you

BERLIN
I know youre trying to help
me but you dont understand

HELENA

BERLIN

The man who killed Amber is a
psychopath He was up at the in-
stitute to kill you - he dont
wanna kill Rose - he was there
to kill you - thats the truth -
and I didnt wanna tell it to
you - but thats the reason I
want you to stay at Margies -
coz I cant protect you here

HELENA
Why does he want to kill me

BERLIN
Coz he thinks youre a witness

HELENA
I cant identify him

BERLIN
He dont know that I didnt

HELENA
Then why didnt he kill me

Back at the booze and hes almost inaudible Stop it will you

Something snaps in

Why didnt he kill me John

BERLIN and he throws his glass at the grate

BERLIN
Will you fucken stop it Im not
Serato He didnt kill you coz
he wasnt here he isnt in the

room with you and lets you live

And just as suddenly hes full of remorse Takes HELENA in his

arms with a lot of

sorrys But she isnt interested in apology

Theres a passion in her face And fire even in her blind eyes

HELENA
Kiss me John Kiss me he does
I love you kiss me again he does
I love you Are my lips lying to
you Kiss my mouth he does Is my
mouth lying to you He Was Here
144 INT GARAGE HOUSE NIGHT

Music slams in on the cut Berlin is about to take this garage
to pieces He searches cans and boxes and stacked timber What
ever it is his eyes are looking The Camera looks down from ab-
ove Bits and pieces all over the floor but he discovers nothing

145 INT BATHROOMBEDROOM HOUSE NIGHT

Close on a hand searching underside of the bath Pipes and cob-
webs He reaches toward the taps His hand is literally inches
from the Walther (taped to the end of the tub) Fingers almost
touch it Just a fingernail away when HELENA interrupts John

HELENA (0S)
I just remembered something

And BERLIN rolls out and stares up like a mechanic under a car
He used a breath freshener

BERLIN
A breath freshener

HELENA stands in the doorway and BERLIN is already on his feet

HELENA
I heard it hiss twice

BERLIN wipes a thought through his hair with fingers I dont
know what that means Walks past into the bedroom Everything
taken apart Every drawer open and the bed heaped with clothes

BERLIN
hes either here to take
something or leave some-
thing I dont find nothing

146 INT LIVING ROOM HOUSE NIGHT

BERLIN pours last of the whisky Looks totally snuffed out He
and HELENA sit on the same sofa but the atmosphere puts them a
mile apart A yellow pad on the table covered in notes BERLIN

swallows scotch and reads to himself I guess we all got lucky

HELENA
You gotta stop drinking darling

Another mouthful of scotch and she hears the glass hit the table

Hes glad youre drinking Every
drink you take youre helping him

BERLIN
He doesnt need my help

HELENA
I know about alcohol John

BERLIN
You do

HELENA
Im blind because my father drank

Thats what she knows about alcohol and hed prefer to be dead

I lost everyone I ever loved I
lost my hopes my future Im
in love with you John I dont

want them to take you away from me
147 INT INTERROGATION ROOM POLICE STATION DAY

St ANNE is close enough to kiss BERLIN Right into his space and
talking right into his face And today hes not in a good mood

St ANNE

He humiliated you In front of every
one In front of a bunch of secret-
aries Well that would piss any-
one off That would piss me off
Id be real mad if a guy did that to
me and called himself a friend Coz
that aint a friendly thing to do
You side with friends You dont
go bitchin on them behind their back

And he suddenly switches gear And whispers like its a secret
He wasnt much of a friend at all

BERLIN
Ross was my best friend

St ANNE
Did you shoot your best friend

BERLIN
No

St ANNE
The next time I ask you that quest-
ion youre gonna tell me the truth

St ANNE shunts back in his chair Expands the frame as he goes
Sergeant TAYLOR sits on a chair with his back to the wall Cig-
arettes and ashtray on the table next to his St ANNE lights a
Pall Mall and as if its an after-thought he snaps the Sony on

TAPE

up Footsteps on cast iron stairs

ces Sound of someone breathing hard

BERLIN already looks devastated Hes about to got annihilated

ness Jesus Christ What are you do-
ing What the fuck are you doing Its

Dont shoot you crazy bastard 2 shots

Sony off and BERLIN is too stunned to breathe

St ANNE
Thats second degree - you wanna stop
at that Will you give me that John

BERLIN gives him nothing but silence A knock on the door Come
in And the ASSISTANT hands St ANNE a note Reads it and excus-

es himself Leaves

the silence for BERLIN But TAYLOR breaks it

TAYLOR
Hes offerin you a deal
Why dont you take it

BERLIN
He aint offerin me shit

TAYLOR lights a cigarette and exhales Something of a real red-
headed fuck about him And BERLIN would like to break his neck

Youre letting it show King Jay

TAYLOR
I dont like you But dont kid
yourself I dont take no ple-

asure sitting in on another cop
He rolls ash off his cigarette and pushes it round the ashtray

Your an alcoholic arent you
(BERLIN stares)
Its written in your file

The phone rings and TAYLOR answers Puts his red eyes at BERLIN
They want you to look in the mirror

BERLIN has to find every strength for this one Humiliation com-
pounds Gets up and stares at his own haunted face in the glass

148 INT ANTI ROOMINTERROGATION POLICE STATION DAY

The MYOPIC peers into BERLINs face St ANNE stands close with
his toilet roll Light refracts in the MYOPICs lenses I seen
him up there quite a lot St ANNE blows his nose Is that the
man you saw that night He stares again at the tormented face

MYOPIC
Well I dunno it could be

St ANNE
Alright thank you Mr Dawson

Hes escorted to the door and his space is occupied by CITRINE

CITRINE
Whats all this deal business

St ANNE on his way to the door now He pauses for the question

St ANNE
I can have him out of here on a sec-
ond degree this afternoon I own him
and he knows it And Chief Im still
waiting for that warrant on his house

149 INT WAITING AREA POLICE STATION DAY

HELENA waits on a bench in the empty room Maybe a few scruffy
magazines But nothing of use to her in here except shes near
Berlin He arrives like every hope got abandoned and sits next
to her They clasp one anothers hands before she embraces him

BERLIN
You dont wanna sit here
any more sweetheart

HELENA
I wanna be near you
Something difficult to tell her and doesnt know how to say it

BERLIN
I think theyre gonna arrest me

HELENA
I dont want them to arrest you

BERLIN
Its not as bad as it sounds
They cant refuse me bail Raise
bail of my own cognizance and find
the best damned lawyer there is

Her tears are close to his face No one but him could hear her

HELENA
Oh John Id do anything
anything to get you free

150 INT INTERROGATION ROOM POLICE STATION DAY

If the waiting room felt bad try sitting in here Both St ANNE
and TAYLOR are smoking and the Sony playing again This is the
final part of the tape No speech but a lot of labored breath-
ing Ross groaning and now the sound of his shotgun More desp-
erate inhalations and now sound of the last shot into his neck

St ANNE
and that ones with malice
that ones first degree why

dont you stop lying to me
(Clicks Sony off)

Cmon John I can help you Why

dont you tell me the truth

BERLIN
Ive told you the truth It
isnt me Ive never call-

ed Ross Freddy in my life

TAYLOR
Ive heard you call him Freddy

BERLIN
You havent And you got no voice
in here Taylor so keep it shut

St ANNE
Tell a lotta lies dont you Some-
thing that comes naturally to you

BERLIN
I dont lie

St ANNE
Prepared to lie to your Chief

BERLIN
Under exceptional circumstances

St ANNE
What were the circumstances that
caused you to lie to Freddy Ross

BERLIN
I never lied to Ross

St ANNE
You didnt

Shakes his head in confirmation And St ANNE finds a notebook

Well he thought you did Wrote
it down in his book John Berlin
is a liar Right here underlined

BERLIN stares at the book and can barely credit what hes seeing

Dated the day you got your first
break with your Mystery Man
You dont know why he wrote that

(He doesnt)
Maybe he thought there was no Myst-
ery Man That the investigation was
bullshit That you were making it up

And during the next attack St ANNE will work himself into rage

Coz you wanted to be Top Cop Isnt
that why you went running up that gar-
bage dump so everyone could stand in
awe of the Top Cop Isnt that why
you came up here Coz you couldnt make
it in LA Get yourself a pissy lit-
tle degree come up here and be Top
Guy But Ross was Top Guy wasnt he
Always would be Top Guy And you know
what He did it without even trying
Everybody loved him He had everything
you wanted didnt he - Great woman -
Great kid - Everything you couldnt

have - And you wanted it to go away
Coz your life was lousy wasnt it -
A lousy life with a lousy wife who
was fucking everyone wasnt she Is
that why you pick on a little Blind
Girl - coz you can control her - Is
that it - Control who shes fucking

Tears of grief and tears of rage BERLIN cant restrain either

You wanna lose your temper with me
Cmon John lose your fucken temper
Youre good at losing your temper

BERLIN
No way Mr St Anne

St ANNE

Lost your temper with Ross didnt
you Cmon tell me the truth Is
that what happened You had an arg-
ument in the car Lost your temper
with him Stood over him blew his
fucking larynx out with a Glaser -
Where were you aiming John Going
for his face Blow his fucking face
away because you hated him so much

BERLIN is a wreck of despair But somehow he keeps his dignity

BERLIN
I loved that guy and the hard-
est thing to take in here is

knowing he thought I killed him
St ANNE
Well that he did And
that do I Sergeant Berlin
And at last he looks pleased Because hes got this man busted

What do you take for that
breathlessness Sergeant

Cant take anymore questions Answers with a shake of his head
How about Aminophylline

BERLIN
I dont know what that is

St ANNE
You dont Its ant anti-asthma medic-â€”
ation prescribed for breathlessness

Produces a capsule in a plastic bag and throws it on the table
Came out of the ashtray of your car

Every cell in BERLINs body freezes Misinterpreted by St ANNE
But you dont know what it is

But he does know what it is The pill he found in the VW van
You dont know how it got there

TAYLOR stares a rock drill and St ANNE stares something similar
You dont use it for breathlessness

BERLIN focuses a fragment of hope But no sign of hope in here
Im running outta questions John and
youre running out of lies Im offer-
ing you one last chance and you better
take it or the US Attorney is gonna

put you in the God-damned gas chamber

BERLIN
I need some time to think Sir

St ANNE
Alright Think about it But dont
you make a fool of me You come in
here with one more lie and I bull-
shit you not Im gonna press for
the maximum penalty there is And
thats the death penalty Sergeant

151 INT WAITING AREA POLICE STATION DAY

BERLIN hurries in and grabs HELENAs hand Instantly transmits
the adrenalin They head for the door with him whispering hard

BERLIN
We got a break - isnt much but its
a break the man that murdered Ross

gets asthma - its not a breath fresh-
ner darling - its an asthma inhaler

BERLINHELENA couldnt have been in the house longer than its
taken to call Los Angeles MARGIE infected with the excitement
although as yet she hardly knows whats going on BERLIN paces
the tiles on a long phone lead Eyes to MARGIE while they wait

BERLIN
This capsule came out of a VW van -
I didnt even think about it - stuck
it in the ashtray - if Id been smok-
ing ita been thrown away weeks ago

Another excruciating wait plus further explanations for MARGIE

I had the van - this guy drove that
van takes his medication and loses

Dumps the phone and stokes anxiety in HELENA and MARGIEs eyes

No Amanda with a white Volkswagen

ta get down there find that store

Everything happens in a hurry He embraces HELENA Shell pray
for him Already out the back door with MARGIE in tow A black
and white parked in the drive with VENABLES stuffed inside Plus
a grim wind tearing trees BERLIN pauses as he reaches his car

BERLIN
You be careful This mans close

Catches her eyes Can barely look at them Theyre full of hate

MARGIE
If you find him John I want you
to call me I wanna know his name

153 EXT HILLSIDE OAKLAND DAY

Wide over the bay area Wind swept and rain swept City lights
beginning to come on In the distance the docks and far beyond
the ocean Somewhere here is a solitary phone booth Im look-

ing for a special type of rattan friend of mine recommended
you said I should ask for someone called Amanda You dont
OK Thank you Followed by sound of a phone slamming down

154 INT PHONE BOOTH HILLSIDE STREET DAY
A stack of coins and a pair of ripped out Yellow Pages BERLIN
crosses off another number Running out of craft shops and run-
ning out of quarters A new number hears the same old bullshit
But this one is answering good Fights to keep his voice light

BERLIN (Phone)
Shes not there - Let me just make

155 INT ANTIQUE MARKET CRAFT EMPORIUM DUSK

The kind of store heads open in abandoned warehouses A jungle
of jewelry and cane furniture and ethnic junk Many chairs of
the ilk Berlin saw in the Volkswagen van And now hes staring
at its driver His POV through windows He watches as a red
headed Girl clears the till in preparation to close up within
moments the lights are dead and AMANDA is heading for her door

156 EXT MARKETWAREHOUSE CAR PARK DUSK

Plenty of rain to hurry in AMANDA drives a red Datsun She ex-
its the car park with a man in a brown Chevrolet following her

157 EXTINT CARSTREETS SUBURBS OAKLAND NIGHT

The Chevy tails the Datsun through city streets A lot of rush
hour traffic Music to go with it and its probably Mussorgsky

A final cut and headlights are navigating the hills Disappear
and reappear as they ascend Steep inclines and the houses are
middle class Too dark to see much now but lamp posts and rain

Still climbing the Datsun takes a side street BERLIN keeps 50
yards behind She turns off and parks in a sloping driveway A
white Volkswagen van at the top of it BERLIN has already pull-
ed over Kills his lights and watches her hurry into the house

158 EXT STEEP STAIRS PORCH HOUSE NIGHT
BERLIN just rang the doorbell Imposes an impartial expression

But this is his last chance and he knows it The front door is
opened and secured on a safety-chain AMANDA carries a white Cat

BERLIN
Im sorry to trouble you but eh
Wait a minute dont I know you
And she stares like he does not Before she stares like he does

Youre Amanda Remember you near-
ly ran into me Way up in Trinity

His smile disarms the securities And she opens the front door

AMANDA
As I said Sergeant you nearly
ran into me Whats the problem

BERLIN
Im afraid its the van again

AMANDA
The van

BERLIN
Is it your vehicle

AMANDA
No my mothers You better stop
in Im just here to feed the cat

159 INT HALLWAY HOUSE NIGHT

So far so good Inside without showing an ID he doesnt have
This is a gloomy place She shuts the door Shuts out the gale

BERLIN
Im sorry to worry you with this but
we had a real serious robbery and we-
re chasing a white VW van You guy
came up an the computer so as a matt-
er of routine we have to check Could
you tell me whos driven it recently

AMANDA
Only me and Mom

BERLIN
How about any guys on your staff

AMANDA
We only got one He doesnt drive

BERLIN AMANDA
Would he have lent it to anyone No
How bout your Dad Husband Boyfriend

AMANDA
He is my boyfriend My fath-
ers dead and Im divorced

BERLIN
I see

His hopes are collapsing by the moment and nothing else is left
Would you mind if I took a look at it

AMANDA
I thought this was routine

The Cat cries for its food and AMANDA begins to look suspicious

The only man that has driven it in
the last 6 months is my uncle And
no way is he involved in a robbery

BERLIN
Could I have his name Just so
I can officially eliminate him

Maybe too much charge in his head and she doesnt like the vibe

AMANDA
Could I see your badge again

Sure she can and he searches for it Must have left it at home

Then you better go and get it I
feel uncomfortable without an ID

AMANDA opens the front door just long enough for BERLIN to leave

been thorough St ANNE appears at the door and TAYLOR looks over

TAYLOR

BOBBY appears somewhere behind the Ladies TV commentary con-
tinues Meanwhile Sergeant Berlin remains in a cell at police
headquarters arraigned on what is believed to be a 50000000

Except for the one face that isnt sad and it belongs to BOBBY

HELENA descends the stairs with her luggage Shes towards the

stall as the gale sucks their electricity Ignorant of his pre-
sence she loses her bags and disappears into the den He moves
after her and startles the shit out of MARGIE as she comes out

MARGIE
Jesus What are you doing here

TAYLOR
Been trying to call your lines

MARGIE heads for a table and unloads a strong-box of documents
Is she going somewhere
MARGIE

ute Her new term starts tomorrow

rage But get mad in here and get nothing No shoe strings and

ortunity to talk to them - thats

because if you dont shes dead

St ANNE
Didnt push her down stairs on
their previous meeting did he

BERLIN
He was up there to plant the gun

St ANNE
Did Taylor plant this too

Produces a Zippo in a plastic sack and BERLINs senses capsize
Is it yours

A question for which St ANNE expects no answer and he is right
We found Jennifer Eight At least
weve found a headless and handless
girl A couple of hunters found her

Maybe BERLIN asks him Where or maybe his expressions enough
About 4 miles south of the institute
less than 50 feet from the road This
was less than 100 feet from the body

BERLIN cant believe it and knows St ANNE wouldnt believe him
Is it yours - (no answer) - I know
its yours - You know its yours

The only prints on it are Freddys
You wanna tell me how it got there
BERLIN wouldnt believe it either

St ANNE and BERLIN look surprised

TRAVIS
Margie Ross put up your bond Sir

BERLIN
Are you getting in the way of it

Door open and TRAVIS enters

And BERLIN looks at St ANNE

St ANNE examines the bailbond paper and raises eyes to BERLIN

St ANNE
I dont make the law

stairs in apparent oblivion to BERLINs distress BERLIN races

back to the den and new problems

Desperate to get at the guns
but all cabinets locked Wheres the keys Bobby I need a gun
Theyre my Dads guns

BERLIN
Come on Bobby for Gods sake I
wanna get the man that killed him

BOBBY stares at BERLIN as though hes staring at that very man

olver plus a 12 gauge Remington and the slugs that go with it

ion thats the link - thats why

upon mile of road he has yet to travel Still it ascends until
the Chevrolet is reduced to an insignificance by the landscape

NIGHT

PIC Janitor is halfway
no time for explanations Call the Police Do it Now Shout-
ing up at him shes already descending Tell em the gymnasium

188 INT GYMNASIUM INSTITUTE NIGHT

MARGIE patrols plate glass windows Where are the fucking cops
Shes shocked and looks strange indeed Wig off but hair grips
all over her head An overcoat and shoes but still wearing the
nightgown underneath A couple of dreary lights in the ceiling
HELENA sits numb under one of them all but hidden in a blanket

MARGIE cant stand waiting any longer Im gonna call them my-
self HELENA nods and sure shes OK to stay here The doors
settle and she is alone Headlights cross the windows shifting
the shadows of everything Swooping the walls they move attent-â€”
ion back to the door TAYLOR stares in and then pushes through

Worse for wear but very much alive Discarded his leather jack-
et revealing the bullet proof vest Blood all over his T-shirt
Looks like he caught one in the shoulder A bad burn and blood
runs from his left hand In his right hand he clasps the knife

He cracks it open like a whip HELENA hears it and stands Ter-
ror as the footsteps approach Margie Margie But Margie is-
nt around Hes less than 30 feet away She tries to back off
but is hindered by the blanket Tries to scream but is stifled
with fear Maybe six seconds to live but this refers to Taylor

Taylor He swings around but this time he doesnt get time to
look surprised BERLIN blows the fucker across the room Solid
load slugs weighing an ounce each crash into him BERLIN keeps
pumping the Remington and doesnt stop firing until the magaz-
ine is over No conjecture now This bastard is very much dead

BERLIN throws the 12 gauge aside And maybe it means something
Maybe at last he accepts hes stopped living in that world and
ready to give himself a chance in this HELENA in his arms and
this is his new world Flashing lights and headlights flood in-
to the darkness Their embrace goes on And this story is told

THE END
