OVER BLACK

The rhythmic percussion of waves lapping on the shore

EXT SLAHI HOME - BEACH - DUSK 1

SEARCH PARTIES stream out of a large WEDDING TENT
Flashlights in hand they comb the grounds of a modest beach
front home but the music and laughter tell us this is all
fun and games The WEDDING PARTY hunt for the bride a
Mauritanian tradition Their fine clothes and high spirits
lend a surreal decadence to the pastoral scene

Away from the Revelers FIND a lone figure drifting across a
scrub of beach This is MOHAMEDOU OULD SLAHI His white daraa billows in the coastal wind A permanent grin
on his face the lightness of his footsteps give the
impression that he could be carried away on the breeze

SUPER Nouakchott Mauritania November 2001

The sun sets on the Atlantic Ocean beyond him but
Mohamedou’s focus is on a trail of footprints in the sand
They lead to a brightly colored skiff beached on the shore
Mohamedou perches against the boat pleased with himself

(NOTE ALL NON-ENGLISH DIALOGUE WILL BE WRITTEN IN ITALICS)

MOHAMEDOU
(playful in Arabic)
The tide’s coming in Stay here
much longer you won’t just be
hiding you’ll be gone for good

MOHAMEDOU’S NIECE (FROM UNDER BOAT)
Go away Uncle You’re not supposed
to be playing you’re too old

Mohamedou peers inside the skiff finds his NIECE hiding Dressed in a black bridal lakhel dripping with gold
jewelry her hands painted with henna

MOHAMEDOU
I’m not too old to shout tell your
groom where to find you

She clicks her tongue at him He laughs it off leaves her to
her hiding place
INT SLAHI HOME - WEDDING TENT - NIGHT 2

The noisy happy wedding now in full flow Mohamedou moves
through the crowd exchanging embraces with the MALE half of
the wedding party Across the tent the FEMALE half dance
around the bride (his Niece) The BAND lays down rolling
traditional tunes on a lute and electric guitar

MALE WEDDING GUEST 1 MOHAMEDOU
Mashallah Mohamedou Germany It’s been too long Uncle

MALE WEDDING GUEST 4 MOHAMEDOU (CONTD)
You go to the Bundesliga Faster even

as he looks on TV Hold on hold on

Mohamedou tracks down a TEA BOY snags a glass from his tray
as he passes Mohamedou sips the hot green tea winces

MOHAMEDOU (CONTD)
Are you serious This isn’t enough
sugar

Mohamedou steps after the Tea Boy but is intercepted by --

A MALE WEDDING GUEST huddles close to him whispers in his
ear Concern washes over Mohamedou his eyes dart to

The FAMILY HOME beyond the wedding tent A MAN in a western
suit waits ominously by the back door This is DEDDAHI (50s)
the head of Mauritania’s Intelligence Service Nonchalantly
he cleans burnt tobacco from his pipe

EXT SLAHI HOMESTREET - MOMENTS LATER 3
Mohamedou emerges from the house to find

His terrified MOTHER standing near Deddahi and two more
UNIFORMED OFFICERS Their two Black Mercedes sedans block the
narrow dirt road A few WEDDING GUESTS look on with concern

everyone knows who Deddahi is

MOHAMEDOU
Mama go inside
MOHAMEDOU’S MOTHER
Is this about the new satellite
dish you put up

MOHAMEDOU
No It’s nothing

MOHAMEDOU’S MOTHER
If it’s nothing they can come back
tomorrow

MOHAMEDOU
Then tomorrow will be ruined too
Please let us talk

Deddahi takes a puff at his pipe and blows the smoke away
from the face of the older woman Mohamedou gently ushers his
Mother back towards the house Then turns to Deddahi --

MOHAMEDOU (CONTD)
How many times can I say the same
thing I don’t know where Mahfouz
is I doubt Bin Laden even knows

DEDDAHT
After these New York attacks the
Americans they’re going crazy

MOHAMEDOU
Yeah they put Mahfouz’s bounty up
to 25 million Wallahi if I knew
where he was I would have turned
him in myself I had to borrow from
my boss to pay for my niece’s
wedding

DEDDAHT
It’s not in my hands Mohamedou
They want to talk to you
Mohamedou glances back to his Mother watching from the house
MOHAMEDOU
Let me change they’ll confuse me
for a Gulf prince

Deddahi smirks nods him on

INT SLAHI HOME - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER 4

Mohamedou changes into jeans and a shirt eyes out the window
where Deddahi and his Officers smoke and chat in the street

Mohamedou slips out his cell phone a moment of hesitation
before he deletes all his contacts

EXT SLAHI HOMESTREET - MOMENTS LATER 5

Mohamedou steps out his Mother trailing after him anxious
The Officers perk up as they approach --

DEDDAHT
You’1l ride with me

MOHAMEDOU
I can drive myself
(then explaining)
The only thing people should talk
about at a wedding is the bride

DEDDAHT
(suspicious)
Then give me your phone

Mohamedou hands it over Deddahi’s insurance policy

DEDDAHI (CONTD)
(to Officers)
Yalla he knows the way

Deddahi and his Officers climb into their Mercedes Mohamedou
hustles to his old silver NISSAN parked in the street

MOHAMEDOU’S MOTHER
What do I tell everyone

MOHAMEDOU
Tell them it’s work

MOHAMEDOU’S MOTHER
At night like this you’re
working

MOHAMEDOU
German client different time zone

His Mother suddenly wraps him in a tight hug mutters the
crisis prayer under her breath Mohamedou comforts her

MOHAMEDOU (CONTD)
They wouldn’t let me drive if I
wasn’t coming back
(then)
Save me some cake

Mohamedou squirms free from her embrace slides into his car

His Mother attempts to hold on as if she already knows this
is the last time she will hold her son

INTEXT MOHAMEDOU’S NISSANSTREET - CONTINUOUS 6

Mohamedou pulls out following the police Mercedes ahead He
takes a long look at his mom in the rear-view mirror She
counts out Tasbih (prayers) on her raised right hand

A wave of sadness washes over Mohamedou as she slowly fades
into the night behind him We drive with him for a moment
through this sandy nighttime city

be lucky to have you

NANCY

DAVID
Nancy wed all love a pop at this
administration but there’s more to
consider
(RE top sheet)
PEOPLE WANNA SEE THESE GUYS BURN

JOHN
Including plenty of prospective
clients

JOE

Do we even want to legitimize what
they’re doing down there

NANCY
The US government is holding
upwards of 700 prisoners in
Guantanamo We don’t know who they
are the charges against them and
when or if they’ll ever appear
before a judge This is happening
whether we legitimize it or not

DAVID
-- I don’t want you spinning your
wheels on this

Nancy eyes David who clearly wants her to drop it

NANCY
David as partners we agreed we
could pick our own fights pro
bono without interference I like
the look of this fight
(David nods)
I’m here as a courtesy

Reluctantly amused David eyes Nancy with the warmth reserved
for an old friend Yes she’s trouble but the good kind

DAVID
OK What do you need

NANCY
Just me for now and a translator
with security clearance The
prisoner speaks --
(checks her notes)
Arabic French and German

JOHN
Sounds expensive

NANCY
(Is this a retreat or a
plan)
Teri you speak French right

Teri perks up surprised to be drawn into a conversation way
above her head

TERI
Yes but I’m on the Goranson case
(clarifying)
Airlines price-fixing

NANCY
It doesn’t have legs
(to David)

I looked at it

(back to Teri)
Youve got the wrong plaintiff
He’s already the goof with the
suitcase on his head That’s all
any jury will ever see him as

DAVID

Nancy glances back locks eyes with Teri expectant Implicit
in her poker face is a challenge

The World War II case
Eight Nazi saboteurs got caught
sneaking into the US by sea

the electric chair Rough justice -
that’s what this Administration
wants We’ve taken a lot of
prisoners in Afghanistan working
our way up to bin Laden and the
guys who planned this shit There’s
a backlog needs clearing

COUCH
My understanding is not all the
detainees at Gitmo were caught in
Afghanistan sir

BOB
(from back of room)
Does extraordinary rendition
disturb you Major

COUCH
No They’re the ones who picked
this fight They hit our embassy’s
in East Africa the Cole in Yemen -—
and then the US mainland They made
the battlefield global We gotta
scoop them where we can find them

advantages

Nancy shrugs it off looks out the window

Nancy Teri and the other lawyers sit incongruously in a re-
purposed yellow American school bus They all have GITMO

a Jamaican contractor with short dreads He has Jimmy Buffet
styled island music playing quietly on the radio A MILITARY
ESCORT stands in the aisle to address them

room Across the table sits

Mohamedou gaunt clean-shaven dressed in a tan jumpsuit He
squints at the sunlight streaming through the open door He
puts down a SMALL GREEN EXCERCISE BOOK and a pencil The
Guard quickly slams it shut behind them

Mohamedou has not only lost weight but also his lightness of
spirit His calm zen-like presence masks a deep-seated
hopelessness born from his three years of captivity

TERI
(unsure)

NOTICE Mohamedou wears ankle shackles looped into an eye-bolt
in the floor Teri nervously starts in French

Theresa Duncan et je voudrais
présenter Parteneur Nancy
Hollander

Mohamedou moves to his feet A small smile breaking on his

face

MOHAMEDOU
My lawyers

He holds his arms out and Teri and Nancy in turn awkwardly
embrace him

TERI

Amazing You speak English
MOHAMEDOU

So do you
TERI

We didn’t know - how did you learn

MOHAMEDOU
One word at a time When I first
came here I hated the sound of
English because of the pain they
caused me I tried not to learn it
But that was emotion Later wisdom
took over I decided to learn so I
could better understand my
situation and my environment

He gestures to the chairs
19A

MOHAMEDOU (CONTD)
Please sit If we are in my home

I offer tea y’know but we are not
in my home

NANCY
Let’s see what we can do about
that

They all take a seat
NANCY (CONTD)
I’m Nancy Hollander this is my
associate Teri Duncan We are with
a firm called Freedman Boyd and
Hollander based in New Mexico We
wish to represent you

MOHAMEDOU
Straight to business very American
of you Maybe we get to know each
other first yes

TERI
We brought you some food
(offers him the take-away
bag)
I hope it’s okay it’s all they
have on base

Mohamedou peers in the bag pushes it away

MOHAMEDOU
Thank you but I watch my figure

NANCY
Mr Slahi - I under --

MOHAMEDOU
Mohamedou Call me Mohamedou

NANCY
Mohamedou yesI understand it
might be hard to believe but we are
not here as interrogators or
working for the US government in
any way

MOHAMEDOU
When you walk in already I know
this No interrogator is afraid of
his prisoner y’know

Teri embarrassed but Nancy pushes on --

NANCY
Let me explain your legal
situation In June the Supreme
Court ruled that prisoners in
Guantanamo are entitled to file
habeas corpus petitions A habeas
petition requires the government to
produce the evidence which they
have against a prisoner

(MORE)
NANCY (CONTD)
Then a court decides if that
evidence is enough to justify
holding the prisoner If it isn’t
the prisoner is released

Nancy slides a contract and pen across the table
NANCY (CONTD)
If you agree to let us represent
you well file for a writ of
habeas on your behalf

Mohamedou eyes the form with suspicion

MOHAMEDOU
But you don’t even ask me if I am
guilty
NANCY
Are you
MOHAMEDOU
No
TERI

So why do you think you are here

MOAHMEDOU

I was in the wrong place at the
wrong time And because of this
they kidnaped me from my home
imprisoned me in Jordan for 5
months then a military base in
Afghanistan - which was like living
in a toilet by the way - and then
brought be here with a bag on my
head and chains around my body

(getting upset)
Would this happen to you If I was
Swedish or American No They think
they can do it because I am an Arab
and my country is weak - and I am
stupid

Nancy just nods but Teri is visibly distressed

NANCY
What do they accuse you of during
your interrogations

MOHAMEDOU
Wallahi I am interrogated eighteen
hours every day three years
(MORE )
21A

MOHAMEDOU (CONTD)
That’s like go ask Charlie Sheen
to name all his girlfriends

Teri laughs at the unexpected reference

TERI
So you get the news here

MOHAMEDOU
Now because I “co-operate” they
let me have a TV We don’t get real
news but y’know we have this
show ‘E exclamation’

TERI
(continuing the joke)
It’s just ‘E’ I think the
exclamation is silent

NANCY
(wont be distracted)
They must accuse you of something

MOHAMEDOU
They accuse me of being here They
say “you are here so you must have
done something bad Otherwise you
wouldn’t be here” How can I argue
against such crystal logic

NANCY
Were you a member of Al Qaida

MOHAMEDOU
Yes - but a long time ago for a
few months in 1991 I fought WITH
the Americans against the
communists who were killing our
women and children I killed no
one Then I left I have nothing
more to do with them

NANCY
Can you prove that

MOHAMEDOU
What do you want a receipt

He lets out an exasperated “bof”

NANCY
Have they shown any evidence
against you
MOHAMEDOU
Nothing One time they showed
that I had taken a call from Bin
Laden’s satellite phone --

TERI
Did you

22A
MOHAMEDOU
Yes but it was my cousin He calls
me I don’t know what phone he is
using Its a crime to take a call

NANCY
And he only called you once from
Bin Laden’s phone

MOHAMEDOU
(suddenly cautious)
They are watching everything I
say y’know everything I do

Mohamedou motions to the security camera in the corner

TERI
They only have video

Mohamedou just laughs cynically at their naivete

MOHAMEDOU
We can’t talk about these things
not here

NANCY
Would you write it down
Your story How you got here
everything that happened to you

MOHAMEDOU
So my interrogators can read it
ask me “What do you mean by this
Why you are talking in code”

NANCY

We need your testimony and if you
let us represent you we’ll have
attorney-client privilege That
means anything you tell us and
anything you write down is
protected from the prosecution by

the envelopes That’s very
important Then they’1l be sent to
a secure facility in the US where
we can read them If the seal’s
broken we’ll know

So I tell you everything and
you go to America and make trouble

answer for all the trouble you’ve
made

As long as you’re here I’1ll keep
coming back As your lawyer that’s
what I’1l do until you get out

Mohamedou scrawls a number onto Nancy’s notepad

MOHAMEDOU (CONTD)

Teri studies the number on the notepad as --

Suddenly the door swings open the Female Guard steps in She
holds out a manila envelope --

get them back at the secure
facility Stateside

Nancy and Teri drop their notebooks into the envelope The
Female Guard seals it as she leads them to the door --

MOHAMEDOU

TRANSLATOR( THROUGH PHONE)
Yes she is here

TERI
Please tell her my name is Teri
Duncan I’m here with my associate
Nancy Hollander We’re lawyers

TRANSLATOR (THROUGH PHONE)
Mohamedou You’ve seen him

TERI
Yes In Guantanamo prison Cuba

The translator relays this We hear a heaving sob emanate
from Mohamedou’s mother - something primal and gut wrenching

Teri struggles to keep her emotions in check

A PARALEGAL at the door Nancy motions her into the room The
Paralegal slinks in hands Nancy a note

Nancy eyes the note mutes the phone --

TERI (CONTD)
They asked for money to feed and
clothe him -- he wasn’t even in the
country -

Nancy cuts her off

NANCY
- why do you think Mohamedou wanted
us to call her

TERI
Because she’s his mother

NANCY

Because every mother thinks their
son is innocent That’s what he
wants us to hear But that’s not
the case we’re building We need to
prove the US government lacks
evidence sufficient to detain him
Anything else is a distraction

that

NOTICE an office door open - other LAWYERS and GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS reading quietly in their own bubbles

KENT (CONTD)
Once weve reviewed the material we
either designate it classified or

have to come in here to view it -
we will fax it to your office
where it can only be accessed by
those with proper clearance If
anything outta here shows up in my
Sunday paper - well you ladies are

his POV He wears black-out goggles and a hood and initially
he can only see a small amount of light coming in at the
bottom of the hood

Blackness Shouts struggle to be heard over the air-sucking
whine of the C17’s jet engines

MULTIPLE GUARDS
WALK HEAD DOWN KEEP WALKING NO
TALKING DO NOT TALK I’M GONNA
FUCKING HURT YOU

From Mohamedou’s POV we begin to see glancing images out of
the bottom of his baggoggles A piece of the C-17 airplane
a daisy-chain of MILITARY GUARDS shoving a line of PRISONERS
in orange jumpsuits black bags over heads hands and feet
shackled NOTICE a soldier’s glove has GITMO CUBA
stencilled on it

The guards force the detainees to keep their heads down
bending their backs Mohamedou stumbles --

MISC GUARD
Up Get the fuck up

A Guard yanks him to his feet pushes him on

We stay in Mohamedou’s POV as he steps out into the blazing
Cuban sun

MISC GUARDS
Step don’t fucking fallDon’t you
die on me honey

The C17 sits on the Guantanamo airstrip Mohamedou moves on
keeping step with the others

Military Guards shout for the prisoners to kneel

MISC GUARD

down Fuck-head

Moahmedou is pushed down on his knees and his black-out hood
is lifted and his goggles are knocked as a guard pours water
somewhere near his mouth Now he can see a little bit more
The Prisoner next to Mohamedou struggles to stay upright

PRISONER 1 (THROUGH BAG)

remove his goggles and hood The goggles have left raw
broken skin around his eyes and ears

For the first time Mohamedou can see soldiers and other
prisoners around him It’s all a blur of faces lights a
shower another prisoner - a big black man naked

Mohamedou is shoved by the Guards into the open shower The
water is freezing his chained hands cover his privates
Unmasked we see that his head and beard have been shaved
clean

The Guards pull Mohamedou out roughly dry him and then bend
him over a table for a rectal exam

Then he’s marched into

INT GUANTANAMO BAY - CLINIC - DAY - FLASHBACK 37

A NAVAL NURSE (30s M) examines Mohamedou He checks his
eyes ears heart-rate but never directly addresses
Mohamedou A young MOROCCAN TRANSLATOR translates --

NAVAL NURSE
Any known diseases

MOHAMEDOU
Sciatic nerve my lower back

The NAVAL NURSE ignores this and just takes blood

When he’s done two guards pull Mohamedou up dress him
pulling his chains through arm and legs holes ina
choreographed practiced manner His legs will barely support
him - we realize how exhausted he is after a 40 hour journey

(NOTE Unless otherwise mentioned Mohamedou is always clean
shaven (beard and head) and wearing an Orange Jumpsuit in the
FLASHBACKS)

Now they take his picture and attach it to a LARGE GREEN
ARMBAND which is wrapped around his wrist and locked with a

Mohamedou puts his free hand on his head while they undo the
other hand Once that’s done they slam the bin-hole shut

Mohamedou ( claustrophobic struggling to breath) takes in
his new home

There’s no window just dim strip light which remains on 24
hours a day The walls are metal There’s a toilet and sink
in the corner A thin mattress on a concrete slab for a bed
Neatly placed on the bed are a prayer mat a Quran and basic
toiletries a small bar of soap a micro-tube of toothpaste
and a ‘finger toothbrush’ which has “Maximum Security”
printed on it

This must be the loneliest place on earth

was lying here So we buried him

The Bedouin motions to a pile of rocks on the ground A
modest burial marker

MOHAMEDOU’S MOTHER
He died alone

BEDOUIN
(nodding)
His camels were still here

Mohamedou stares at the pile of rocks all that remains of
his father The vast desert stretches beyond him Mohamedou
perks up at the sound of distant singing

MOHAMEDOU’S FATHER
Something that never holds still I
cannot keep it in place

His FATHER walks a line of camels into the endless desert He
sings a traditional hida song to calm his flock --

10 YO MOHAMEDOU
Baba Baba we’re here come back

But his Father doesn’t hear him keeps on walking slowly
disappearing over the horizon

10 YO MOHAMEDOU (CONTD)

desert

But he can’t move his ankles now buried in the sand As he

Poulson takes a chair opposite Mohamedou The translator sits
warily off to the side Santiago stands in the corner -
chewing tobacco and spitting into a plastic bottle

Santiago is a former Marine at once type-A and mellow a
Californian who actually surfs Poulson feels more East
Coast uptight and buttoned-down

Poulson leans in and unshackles Mohamedou’s wrists

POULSON
Are you hungry Thirsty

The translator translates Mohamedou shakes his head

POULSON (CONTD)
Were here to have a conversation
We want to understand your whole
story - that’s it No one’s going
to hurt you that shit’s not
allowed If we were in the U-S
youd be provided with a lawyer
free of charge We’1ll sit here as
long as it takes You understand

SANTIAGO
You have any questions

Mohamedou looks up eyes suddenly alive - a glimpse of a
younger more naive man that we have seen before

MOHAMEDOU
Why Cuba

The agents are taken aback

MOHAMEDOU (CONTD)
You guys hate Cuba

POUSLSON
Who says we’re in Cuba

MOHAMEDOU
I saw it on a guard’s glove when we
got off the plane It’s a secret
were in Cuba

bottle grudgingly amused

SANTIAGO
Not any more The idea is to
disorient you We have a base here
It’s secure It’s warm I can surf
when I’m off-duty

MOHAMEDOU
It works for everybody

SANTIAGO
Exactly

There’s a knock on the door Poulson gets up and returns with
a steaming cup of tea Hands it to a grateful Mohamedou

Santiago assesses whether to answer

Divorced too But we’re not here to
talk about me

POULSON

MOHAMEDOU
He traveled constantly for work He
was a camel herder

MOHAMEDOU (CONTD)
He died when I was nine All his
life he refused to ride in a car
He felt it would ruin his natural
ability to navigate For a Bedouin
knowing what time of day it is and
what direction you are going is
everything It’s so easy to die in
the desert

POULSON
He never rode in a car

SANTIAGO
I’m calling bullshit

MOHAMEDOU
You are right I’m lying One time
he got in a car to look for a lost
calf But he freaked after about 2
seconds and got out

Santiago spits into his bottle

Mohamedou sighs - been through this a thousand times

POULSON (CONTD)
Co-operate and you’ll go home
Start by telling me why your cousin
wired you five thousand dollars
from an Al Qaeda training camp

MOHAMEDOU
I told you this already I’m
beginning to worry about your
memory

POULSON

the money and I paid the hospital

POULSON
Do you have any proof

MOHAMEDOU

BIN AL-SHIBH

MOHAMEDOU (CONTD)
I don’t know this man

SANTIAGO stands away from the table casually chewing tobacco
with a coke-bottle spittoon Mohamedou Focuses on the spit
gently dripping down the sides of the container

SANTIAGO
Well he knows you We captured him
in Pakistan and I interrogated him
myself He was very co-operative

Mohamedou studies the photo again genuinely puzzled He
closes his eyes for a second trying to recall

MOHAMEDOU
Yes I think we met one time

SANTIAGO
Wrong again bud Ramzi Binalshibh
says he knows you very well

MOHAMEDOU
That’s his name Ramzi

SANTIAGO
He was a key actor in 911 - the
20th hi-jacker He says he stayed
with you in Germany That you
recruited him and other members of
the Hamburg cell - Marwan Al-
Shehhi Ziad Jarrah

MOHAMEDOU
(baffled)
He said that It’s not true

SANTIAGO
Youre not getting what I’m laying
down Mo

SANTIAGO (CONTD)
We now have sworn testimony saying
you were the head recruiter for
911 If you can’t sell me on your
version of events I gotta go with
Binalshibh’s

Mohamedou stares at the photo remembering

MOHAMEDOU
Yes yes I remember He stayed
with me only one night It was a
favor for a friend from the Mosque
My house was like that ask anyone
in Duisburg anybody could come
stay This guy it was late he
slept on my couch I had to work

I mean

I mean what I say there is no

me I am innocent What do you need
to see to believe this

NANCY
It doesn’t matter what we believe
it only matters what we can prove

old story from home There’s a man
who is super scared of chickens
like always he’s hiding when he
sees them

It is so bad he goes to a
psychiatrist The psychiatrist
yknow he asks ‘why you are afraid
of chickens’ ‘Because the chicken
wants to eat me he thinks I am
corn’ ‘But you are not corn you
are a big man It would be crazy to
think you are corn’ The man says
‘I know that’s why you should be
talking to the chickens’

(then)
You cannot fight for me if you are
chickens and all you see is corn
too

Nancy steels over Refuses to say the words he wants to hear
but Teri --

TERI
Of course we don’t think you’re
corn - or chicken or whatever
right

Nancy still remains mute

We know you’re innocent but we have
to prove it We can’t do that
unless we see the allegations
against you That’s all were
asking for

The sound of the gate opening in the next cell Mohamedou
listens as the Guard shackles Marseille and leads him away

Mohamedou scrambles to his gate brings his eyes up to a
small tear in the mesh He watches through the hole as
MARSEILLE is led back towards the cells

MOHAMEDOU
Don’t let them break you brother

Marseille glances back over his shoulder It’s the first and
only time Mohamedou sees his face He’s a young skinny
French-Algerian Doesn’t look much older than twenty

borders interrogated and held
against his will since 2001
without a single charge laid
against him The Supreme Court said
it will not tolerate further delay
when it ordered these cases to
proceed The government has had
plenty of time

his papers eyes the JAG LAWYERS on the opposite bench

Nancy takes a seat next to Teri as the Government Lawyer
steps up to the lectern -- she glances around as though
missing somebody Teri notices

Your honor the government does not
object to the defense’s right to
disclosure But clearing classified
evidence is an extremely time
consuming process Mr Slahi is a
self-admitted member of al-Qaeda
his case is in fact uniquely
complicated We simply need more
time

JUDGE
The government has ten days to file
or it will find itself back in my
courtroom

Nancy and Teri look to each other flooded with relief But
then a puzzled expression passes over Teri’s face as she
looks around the courtroom catching up with Nancy

confessions how much more could
you need

They were given under duress sir
Fruit of the poisonous tree He
spent seventy days in special
projects tortured Nothing he said
will be admissible

Very much so

That being said even with all the
help we’re getting from the ACLU
we have an uphill struggle It’s

feet on a court date One strategy
to consider is releasing your

To a newspaper

Or maybe a book The court of

one you get

GUARDSTEVE

TERI (THROUGH TV)
- We did explain there would be
times where we would be muted so
he doesn’t think it’s a mistake

Frustrated Mohamedou reaches around the back of the TV set

MOHAMEDOU
I know how to fix this it’s what I
do for work Trust me

Camp Six Guard steps aside Mohamedou switches around a few
cables A moment later the video feed turns on A blurry
image of the courtroom appears on the screen

have any questions

MOHAMEDOU
He is asking me I am the
petitioner

JUDGE ROBERTSON (THROUGH TV)

Open that line a little wider

A flurry of activity in the courtroom as BAILIFFS futz with
the technology

The simple
Mohamedou

On the TV

MOHAMEDOU
He can’t hear me It all works
here why can’t they hear me

NANCY (THROUGH TV)

idea that his voice will be heard startles
NOTICE he nervously traces prayers into his thigh

the banal bureaucracies of the court continue but
Mohamedou

JUDGE ROBERTSON (THROUGH TV)
Now do counsel anticipate opening
statements

NAVY JUNIOR ASSOCIATE (THROUGH TV)
Yes Your Honor

JUDGE ROBERTSON (THROUGH TV)
And will the Bobs determine them to
be classified of unclassified

NAVY JUNIOR ASSOCIATE (THROUGH TV)
There’1l be at least one
classified Your Honor

Mohamedou’s eyes remain wide and alert But as his fate is
decided in a courtroom 1300 miles way the anguish of eight
years imprisonment finally catches up to him He struggles to
hold it together

JUDGE ROBERTSON (THROUGH TV)
Is the detainee going to testify
He understands he doesn’t have to

NANCY
Yes your Honor He wants to He’s
fighting for his life and he has
nothing to hide

truth

JUDGE ROBERTSON
Go ahead detainee

MOHAMEDOU

Thank you your honor
(then)

Where I come from we know not to
trust the police We know the law
is corrupt and the government uses
fear to control us

(MORE )
145A

MOHAMEDOU (CONTD)
But then I moved to Germany as a
teenager for the first time I
experienced living where people
don’t fear the police Where they
believe the law protects them For
me and for so many people in the
world America is like this Even
in Mauritania we have watched ‘Law
and Order’ and Ally Mcbeal And
when I first arrive at Guantanamo
I was happy - because I trusted in
American Justice Never did I
believe I would be eight years a
prisoner without trial That the
United States would use fear and
terror to control me
All my time here I have been told
“You are guilty” Not for what I
have done or what has been proved
but because of suspicions and
association (Beat)
Forgiveness is part of my religion
But if you have a problem with the
United States you will have that
problem forever My captors will
not forgive me for something I have
never done But I am trying to
forgive I want to forgive because
that is what Allah wants
(Beat)
For this reason I do not hold a
grudge against those who abused me
In Arabic the word for “free” and
“forgiveness” is the sameAnd this
is how even here I can be free
(Beat)
For eight years I have dreamed
about being in a courtroom Now
that I am here really I am scared
to death But I hope I can find
peace because I believe this court
is guided by law not fear So I
can accept whatever you decide
Your Honor May God forgive us

EXT GUANTANAMO PATHWAY - SOME WEEKS LATER - DAY

Nancy and Teri walk towards the regular interview room

145A

accompanied by a MILITARY ESCORT They turn as though to

enter the hut -
119A

MILITARY ESCORT
You’re not in there today Maam
Youve been cleared to visit 760 in
his own cell

Surprised Nancy and Teri walk on
145B

MILITARY ESCORT (CONTD)
(conspiratorially)
Were all praying he gets out of
here

Nancy is struck by the simple decency of this soldier

INT MOHAMEDOU’S CO-OP CELL - CAMP ECHO - DAY 145B

This is where Mohamedou has been housed ever since he “co-
operated” - separate from the other detainees Out front he
has a little patch of earth that he has turned into a garden
The cell itself is relatively spacious by Guantanamo
standards the shelves are stacked with books and dvds)
There is a Biblical quotation tacked to the wall What
profits a man if he gains the whole world but loses his soul

Nancy and Terry step in to find Mohamedou already on his
feet arms wide open --

MOHAMEDOU
My lawyers

He wraps them both in a massive hug

MOHAMEDOU (CONTD)
When I am back in Mauritania you
will come to my house I will show
you off to everyone in Nouakchott
‘I know the best lawyers in the
fucking world’

TERI
I look forward to it

Nancy sits down already back to work --

NANCY
In the meantime we need to prepare
for the Government’s appeal --

MOHAMEDOU
What can they appeal We won

NANCY
They’re gonna jam this in the
courts but we’ll be ready --

MOHAMEDOU
Wait how long is this

TERI
We can’t say for sure

MOHAMEDOU
You knew already they would do
this

TERI
The government’s a sore loser
Obama was embarrassed by some of
the coverage in the US press which
called him “soft on terrorists”

MOHAMEDOU
But why you don’t tell me

NANCY
We can only fight what’s in front
of us

MOHAMEDOU

This whole place is in front of me
around me everywhere How long
until I go home

NANCY
- We don’t know But we’ll be
here as long as it takes

Mohamedou is crushed - but as he looks from Nancy to Teri he
knows that they will do everything they can for him

CUT TO BLACK

CARDS OVER BLACK

I remained in custody and never saw my mother again She died
in 2013

Nancy and Teri were as good as their word they visited me on
alternate months for over a decade

In 2015 a redacted version of my letters to my lawyers was
published with the title “Guantanamo Diary” The book brought
public attention to my case

I was finally released on October 17th 2016 having spent 14
years and two months in prison

I was never charged with any crime

goes black
