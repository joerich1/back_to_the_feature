Sweet oblivion without form and void

The tremor of falling water and beneath it a deeper tone
like the rumble of a distant engine

CUT TO

EXT THE WATERFALL DAY

MELISSA McCARTHY opens her eyes convinced she heard her
fiancee’s voice She starts to turn only to remember where
she is her aching shoulders still propped against the
trunk of a stunted rowan tree at the top of the falls the
river foaming brown as heather ale across the rocks below

And of course she is alone
Not merely solitary but truly alone

It is late in the season the boughs of the tree thick with
berries like drops of blood the hills rising wild around
her untrodden and unvisited a wall of snowcaps hanging
over the barren valley like an unspoken threat

MELISSA is still in her mid-twenties but it is as if she
has miswandered on her path through life and grown old
beyond her years pale face etched with concern her
tangled auburn hair already streaked with grey

Noticing a change in the shadows she nervously checks her
watch tears rising unbidden in her eyes as the memories
come flooding back She blinks focusing on the gliding
sweep hand to realize she has lost the best part of an
hour

Struggling to her feet she draws her baggy sweater more
tightly around herself The ugly dun coloured garment has
long since lost its shape a casualty to weeks of cuff
chewing anxiety and deranged rhythmic stroking yet it
serves its purpose acting as a kind of armour a clear
signal to the outside world to give its wearer the very
widest of berths

Donning her army issue anorak she gives the contents of her
pack the once over making certain her medication pitons
crampons ice axe flashlight and the slender coil of nylon
rope are all present and accounted for

Ejecting three pills from the dispenser she downs them in a
single swallow Then crouching beside the burn to refill
her canteen she splashes clear cold snowmelt across her
face closing her eyes and allowing the white noise of the
running water to flow through her stilling the babble of
inner voices
It is close to mid-day and the best part of
still ahead of her

EXT SNOWLINE DAY

A pair of kestrels circle overhead keeping
as she works her way up the valley toiling
fan of terminal moraine and loose debris to
snowline proper eyes fixed on a cwm or gap
ahead Taking a rising traverse she climbs
some eight hundred feet over very good snow

the climb is

CUT TO

MELISSA company
across a huge
reach the

in the ridge
strait up for
until she

reaches the mountain’s boundary wall where she is forced to

unship her ice axe

The altitude tells badly on her slowing her pace to a
crawl as MELISSA ascends a dangerously steep couloir or ice
gully cursing under her breath from time to time and
chanting what sound like bits of half remembered mantras

Above the couloir the heavens have begun to
flurries of snow curl teasingly in the lone

EXT MOUNTAINTOP DAY

MELISSA seats herself in the snow beside an

darken and
climber’s wake

CUT TO

ancient cairn

a filmy veil of cloud drawing slowly down over the summit
like a mysterious curtain that seems to magnify and distort
the sombre ravines and eternal snows that roll away crest

by crest before her

For a moment everything is silent

Reaching into her pack MELISSA comes up with a battered
cardboard carton Placing one hand against the cairn as if
to steady herself she draws herself to her feet gazing

into the void

MELISSA
If you can hear me

That low droning comes again at the very limits of her

consciousness and she turns her eyes to the

streaming

clouds realizing it is probably just the sound of an
aeroplane passing overhead heading someplace else

MELISSA (CONT’D)
If you exist

The droning grows steadily louder although there is still
no sign of an aircraft It is as if the 21st century

refuses to leave her in peace even here
Reaching into the box she begins to scoop out the ashes
She wants to cry holding those fire blackened shards in
her hands but now she needs them the tears wont come

MELISSA (CONT’D)
Try to forgive me

A sudden icy wind whips the ashes from her fingers and she
watches them curl away into the abyss too fast for her to
say goodbye Raising her hipflask she sprinkles a dram
into the void before taking a swig herself silently
wishing the plane might fall from the sky that the whole
world might crash and burn for the sake of a moment’s head
space

The shot tastes good so she takes another tucking in to
the stick of Kendal’s mintcake she’s been saving for the
occasion chewing pensively as a sound like thunder comes
rolling up the valley

It’s not as if she’s expecting a sign but she wishes she
could feel something Anything at all

She finishes the mintcake carefully slipping the used
wrapper into her back pocket before bending to retrieve her
pack not liking the look of those gathering stormclouds
one little bit

Then she notices the greasy column of black smoke belching
skyward from the far side of the corniced ridge

Not really understanding what she’s seeing she shoulders
her pack and starts to turn away only to realize the
droning sound has fallen silent

MELISSA
Fucksake

The source of the smoke is less than a mile away and taking
a bearing with Nidge’s compass she crosses to the edge of
the cliff

Consulting her map she studies the granite outcroppings
that push through the snow beneath her forming a zig-
zagging pattern across the north face of the summit like a
child’s connect-the-dot game Mentally linking the
outcroppings together to form a downward path she lowers
herself over the edge moving sideways like a spider
splayed out on the vertical blue slick

CUT TO
EXT GLACIER DAY

By three pm the sun has begun to vanish behind the ridge
a great curtain of snow wiping out all prospect as MELISSA
inches around an icicle festooned cornice working her way
down into the narrow glaciated saddle on the far side of
the summit

It is already bitterly cold and the long snow slopes at the
base of the cliff have frozen hard creating a perfect
climbing surface that speeds MELISSA’s descent deep blue
shadows leaping up from the cracks around her as the light
dies

Further down total white out conditions prevail and MELISSA
can scarcely see her hands in front of her face as she
starts across the lip of the glacier her path blocked at
every turn by a maze of pinnacles and exhausting knee high
troughs

She is about to turn back when her boot strikes something
A jagged piece of twisted metal

A shadow seems to move behind her and she turns staring
into the flurrying snow

MELISSA
Hello Hey

The wind slackens and she catches her breath as the outline
of the wreck looms from the grey gloom the remains of a
small jetliner strewn haphazardly across the blackened
snow its tail section shorn completely away the cockpit
dangling precariously over the brink of a gaping
bergschrund

MELISSA (CONT’D)
Hey

As if in response she hears a low moan and stepping closer
notices a uniformed figure hunched beside a rent in the
fuselage curling and uncurling in the slush as if trying
to make himself comfortable

MELISSA (CONT’D)
Hey it’s alright

She crouches beside him but the air marshal scarcely
registers her presence There are no visible signs of
injury on his body but when MELISSA tries to touch him he
pulls away emitting a futile animal sound like a bleating
sheep

MELISSA (CONT’D)
Ssshhh It’s okay
Something dangles from the dying man’s wrist a jingling
length of reinforced chain like one half of a broken charm
bracelet

MELISSA (CONT’D)
It’s okay now

She wants to take a closer look but the man’s jerking
senseless movements force her back Then she sees a second
set of tracks in the snow and realizes at least one of the
survivors must have already wandered away from the wreck

MELISSA (CONT’D)
HELLO

But there is only silence Silence and the storm howling
like some great beast closing on its prey

CUT TO

INT FUSELAGE DUSK

MELISSA picks her way gingerly through the wreckage the
failing light slanting through the swirling smoke making
it difficult to see more than a few feet at a time The
beam of her flashlight wavers over two crumpled rows of
double seats briefly illuminating the blood spattered
headrests and dangling oxygen masks She swallows
noticing a pale arm protruding from between two of the
seats and impulsively bends to take its pulse finding it
lifeless and already cold to the touch

VOICE (0S)
Hell

The voice is so low it is almost a sigh

MELISSA stiffens the flesh creeping on the back of her
neck as she turns to face the door leading to the cockpit

MELISSA
Hello Speak up

She braces herself as a gust of wind buffets the plane and
the wreck settles a little in the snow

VOICE (0S)
Hellp me

She realizes the voice isn’t coming from the cockpit at all
but from somewhere on her right Then a shape stirs in one
of the window seats and she sees a dazed blood streaked
face staring back at her flashlight beam
MELISSA
Hey you’re going to be
alright

The man blinks his body wedged tight between the seats

MAN
We passed Fort William

The man’s voice has an eerie tape recorded quality as if
he isn’t really there as if none of this is really
happening He watches disinterestedly as MELISSA tries to
alleviate the pressure on his broken limbs but it is beyond
her strength to lift the crumpled frame holding him in
place

MELISSA
I’m going to get help

MAN
Gun

The cabin tilts abruptly forward and MELISSA is forced to
grab the headrest for support

MELISSA
What

MAN
Get my gun

He grasps reflexively at an empty shoulder holster but the
gun seems to have been flung loose by the impact MELISSA
glances between the seats seeing only a fallen briefcase
The lid has come loose spilling a sheath of mimeographed
transit documents and glossy crime scene photographs In
the half light the details of the photographs are
mercifully unclear

MELISSA
Just try not to move I’m going
to give you a shot

MAN
But you don’t understand She

He struggles to find words watching dazedly as MELISSA
crouches in the aisle rummaging in her pack for a first
aid kit

MAN (CONT’D)
Shes

The MAN’s face whitens as the cabin rocks increasing the
tension on his legs and MELISSA spins sensing movement
behind her
MELISSA
Who’s there

MAN
Behind you

There is a slender raven haired woman silently watching
her lips and pale high forehead flecked with blood

The woman takes a half step towards them and MELISSA
instinctively draws back Steadying herself the newcomer
gazes uncertainly into MELISSA’s flashlight beam

CARLY
Who the fuck are you

MELISSA breathes a sigh of relief realizing the woman is
wearing a ragged air marshal’s jacket

MELISSA
I was over on Ben Mohr and saw
the smoke

CARLY
Is he alright

She nods towards the groaning MAN in the window seat and
MELISSA returns her attention to the first aid kit coming
up with a morphine ampoule and a packet of disposable
needles

MELISSA
He’s lost a lot of blood
Nothing arterial though

CARLY
What are you Mountain rescue or
something

MELISSA prepares the shot searching for a pulse in the
man’s leg

MELISSA
Mountain rescue won’t find you
Not tonight Not in this
weather

CARLY
Great Just fucking great I
mean there’s gotta be a way out
of here right A way down

MAN
We passed Fort William

The wreck shudders in the glacial wind cabin listing
queasily from side to side
MELISSA
First big storm of the winter
You guys are lucky I was going
by

CARLY subsides into the nearest seat and for the first time
MELISSA notices her trouserleg is slick with blood

CARLY
‘Lucky’ isn’t the word for it

MELISSA
Think you can walk

CARLY
Fuck I dunno Maybe Banged
my leg pretty hard

MELISSA
Let me take a squiz
CARLY
Take a what
MELISSA
Take a look Take a quick look

Hold on

CARLY leans back somewhat unnerved by her rescuer’s matted
hair and travel worn clothing

CARLY
Are you a doctor

MELISSA
Sort of Easy does it now

MELISSA peels back the leg of CARLY’s jeans to find the
back of her calf has been almost completely shorn away the
muscle dangling uselessly about her shin a length of
exposed bone glinting wetly in the half light

CARLY
What’s that mean ‘Sort of’

MELISSA
Actually I’m a vet You know
animals They’re more my thing
Now you’re going to feel a little
pressure

MELISSA proffers her hip flask
CARLY

Can’t you just give me a shot
like the other guy
MELISSA
Not if you’re serious about
getting out of here Go to sleep
now and you might never wake

up

CARLY
Maybe it’s better that way

MELISSA
Thatd be too easy

CARLY
I know I suppose we’re in this
together now

MELISSA
And were getting out of it
together I promise

CARLY takes a swig listening to the rattle of wind blown
ice pelting against the fuselage It’s been a long time
since she’s allowed herself a drink and the glow spreads
through her body like good news engendering the desire to
celebrate nothing for no particular reason

CARLY
Who did you say you were again

MELISSA
Melissa

She waits for CARLY to stopper the flask before taking hold
of her trailing muscle and pulling it back into it’s proper
place

CARLY
Aaahhh Fuck Fuck you man

MELISSA
Melissa McCarthy

CARLY
That fuckin’ sucks

MELISSA
I read human physiology at Uni’
if that’s any consolation

She gently squeezes CARLY’s hand before binding her leg
together with an antimacassar scavenged from the back of

the neighbouring seat

CARLY
Sucks so bad

MELISSA
A little pain won’t do you any
harm You may find it sharpens
the senses

CARLY takes a deep breath closing her eyes Then the
cabin dips sharply and she opens them again

CARLY
What was that

MELISSA
We’re on the edge of a precipice
and that’s a bitch of a storm
brewing up out there

CARLY struggles to sit up but MELISSA gently restrains her

CARLY
What did you just say

MELISSA
Just chill for a moment okay
Try to get your strength back

But CARLY isn’t listening Clinging to one of the overhead
lockers for support she manages to draw herself to her
feet

CARLY
You said ‘precipice’ didn’t you
‘Precipice’ is a very bad word

The MAN in the window seat groans as if in agreement head
lolling as he slides in and out of consciousness

MAN
William

MELISSA
Just try to stay put We need
the ballast

CARLY staggers a half step forward pain lancing through
her useless leg the floor of the cabin yawing beneath her

CARLY
Screw the ballast We need to
get the fuck out of here

MELISSA
It’s not that simple

CARLY pauses MELISSA’s hip flask wavering in her hand as
she hears a sound like rolling thunder

CARLY
No good can come of the word
‘precipice’

Then the avalanche breaks a wave of snow surging in
through the gap in the fuselage effortlessly knocking her
back into her seat

MELISSA
Right now there is no ‘out of
here’

CUT TO

EXT GLACIER DUSK

A silent spume of snow sweeps the remains of the aeroplane
into the abyss the nose section lodging some fifty feet
further down

CUT TO

INT FUSELAGE DUSK

MELISSA buckles CARLY into her seat before assuming the
brace position

MELISSA
Looks like we’re in for a little
turbulence

CARLY
The name’s Carly

MELISSA
That’s a nice name Where are
you from Carly

CARLY
Dayton Dayton Ohio

CARLY gets her head down doing her best to imitate her
rescuer

MELISSA
How did you get yourself into
this mess I mean you’re some
kind of cop aren’t you

CARLY
Air marshal We were escorting a
prisoner

She glances at the MAN in the window seat but he has fallen
silent head hanging forward as if resigned to his fate

MELISSA
What sort of prisoner needs his
own aeroplane

CARLY
You don’t need to know that
There’s no point getting into
this any deeper than you are

MELISSA reaches down taking CARLY’s hand in her own and
finding it surprisingly cold She starts to rub it
wanting to share her warmth

MELISSA
All I want is to get through
this to make it through the
night

CARLY
Why don’t we trade I’11 tell
you who the prisoner was if you
tell me what a fuckin’ vet is
doing on top of a mountain with a
bag full of needles and no
bandaid

MELISSA withdraws her hand eyes narrowing

CARLY (CONT’D)
Hit a sore spot did I I’m
sorry

Both of them catch their breath at once as the cabin
lurches slipping another couple of feet down the incline

MELISSA
You believe in God Carly

CARLY
Nah But if I did now would be
the time to start praying

MELISSA
Me neither Still it’s nice to
know we’re in the same boat

CARLY
Yeah Up shit fuckin’ creak
without a paddle

The women cower together hugging their knees as the
fuselage pulls free with a tortured squeal toboganning
down the slope before launching into space

MELISSA
We’re airborne

CARLY
Twice in one day

MELISSA closes her eyes trying to keep her head down not
knowing which way down is anymore

MELISSA
Ommm

CARLY
Mother

MELISSA

Padme hum hri

The impact flings them violently forward the safety belt
burning into MELISSA’s shoulder as the cabin rolls over and
over before grinding to an uneasy halt

CARLY
Fucker

The sound of cracking ice reverberates like gunfire through
the wreckage and CARLY blinks a little surprised to find
herself still alive

MELISSA
The loch we’re on ice We’re
down

MELISSA unfastens her belt dropping upwards onto what used
to be the roof CARLY shakes her head slowly coming to
terms with the fact she is hanging upside down

CARLY
Just like fuckin’ Disneyland
right

MELISSA

The ice is breaking We’ve got
to get clear

CARLY
Only so much cheaper

MELISSA starts to unbuckle CARLY but then the wreck lists
abruptly to one side and they both end up in a tangled heap
in the aisle

MELISSA
Come on I got you

CARLY
Next time I’1l bring the fuckin’
kids

The aircraft is right side up now but slowly sinking black
water pooling around the legs of the man in the window
seat

MELISSA
C’mon for christ’s sake It’s
going fast

CARLY
What about him

MELISSA
Wed need a crowbar to get him
loose

The MAN moans only vaguely aware of what is happening

CARLY
We can’t just leave him

MELISSA
Trust me He won’t feel a
thing

CUT TO

EXT FROZEN LOCH NIGHT

MELISSA eases CARLY from the wreck laying her on the ice
before returning to fetch her pack

All light has faded from the sky and CARLY shivers staring
up into a freezing funnel of eddying snowflakes The world
seems to fade in and out as she struggles to stay
conscious clear one moment and a blur the next closing in
like a camera lens until she seems to be looking out at it
through a small round hole

After a while she becomes aware of MELISSA crouching beside
her once more a fancy customized compass cradled in one
hand as she makes a series of mental calculations

MELISSA
We’re on Lock Tullish There’s a
bothy about a quarter of a mile
from the southern shore

CARLY
Bothy

The wind lulls long enough for her to glimpse the faint
glow of firelight so far away it is barely a pinprick in
the night

MELISSA
What you guys call a cabin
Either way it’s in easy striking
distance

CARLY stares at her in silence lips working as if trying
to form words

MELISSA (CONT’D)
You alright

CARLY
I dink I bid my tunga

The plane has stopped sinking the nose section jutting at
forty-five degrees from the fractured ice

MELISSA
We’ll need a stretcher

One of the curved exit doors has been flung free from the
wreck and unshipping the nylon rope from her bag MELISSA
improvises a harness turning it into a makeshift sled

CARLY
Why are you doing this

MELISSA
I don’t always have to have a
reason for the shit I do
Besides I gave you my word
didn’t I

She helps CARLY onto the sled gently wrapping her in her
dry sleeping bag

CARLY
God I’m cold

MELISSA
You hang in there baby You’re
going into shock

CARLY
So cold

Slipping on her goggles MELISSA shoulders the harness
wincing as the nylon bites into her flayed collarbone

MELISSA
Cmon Help me out here Try to
wriggle your toes

CARLY
I can’t

MELISSA
Just keep ‘em moving We’re
almost home

CARLY
Home

CARLY opens her eyes seeing nothing save a whirling
monstrous whiteness that hems them in on all sides

Despite her discomfort MELISSA manages to make some headway
against the blizzard dragging CARLY step by step across
the ice

MELISSA
One two one two wriggle your
toes C’mon

CARLY
I’m sorry I said those things
to you I mean whatever it is
you’re on I wish I had some

MELISSA

Keep talking Tell me a story
CARLY

I can’t remember any stories

Not now
MELISSA

Then let’s sing Sing with me

The effort of walking warms her and for the first time
MELISSA starts to believe they might make it after all

MELISSA (CONT’D)
Swing low sweet chariot
comin’ for to carry me home
swing low

CARLY
Terrific That’s all we need
right now A song about fuckin’
death

MELISSA
Next time you pick the track

MELISSA tries to think of something less funerial
determined to draw her companion into some interaction that
might keep them both going

She launches into a quavering rendition of ‘Kum-ba-ya’ and
although CARLY does not object she still refuses to join
in her consciousness ebbing like the flame on a guttering
candle fading slowly into the shadows of her body

MELISSA manages to sing the lullaby all the way through
raising her voice in the wilderness and finding it as
soothing as a mantra

After a while she has to stop kneeling in the snow to get
her breath back still holding on to the harness with her
good right hand

CUT TO

INT THE BOTHY NIGHT

A log smoulders on the hearth casting a welcoming glow
over the ancient wooden benches that line three of the
stone building’s smoke blackened walls Two colossal beams
support the open raftered plaster roof and a set of step
ladders stand in the far corner leading to the loft

DONAL RUANE a tousle haired Irishman in his early
thirties sits as close as he can to the fire strumming
aimlessly on a badly tuned guitar a huge joint clenched
between thumb and grubby forefinger

DONAL
So there’s this Frenchman a
Yank a Brit and an Irishman on
this aeroplane that’s about to
crash see And the captain
says ‘I’ve got some bad news for
you’

DONAL’s only audience is an unsmiling Frenchman ensconced
on the right hand bench his back to one of the ladders a
pair of designer reading glasses propped on the end of his
nose his attention focused squarely on the tiny computer
cradled between his knees

DONAL (CONT’D)
There’s only enough gas for one
passenger The other three are
going to have to jump right

The young Frenchman nods wordlessly not really getting it
the touch pen weaving in his hand as he edits and arranges
the days audio samples on the screen before him labelling
each soundscape according to the spot it was recorded at

His name is ERIC RENAULT He came here for the peace and
quiet and right now he’s feeling increasingly fed up with
the Irishman’s rambling monologues

DONAL (CONT’D)
So the frog yells ‘Long live the
Republic’ and hops out the plane
and the Yank hollers ‘Remember
the Allamo’ and jumps after
him

The fire gutters on the hearth and ERIC glances up as their
guide makes his appearance CRAIG WILSON steps in from the
cold closing the door behind him his face covered by a
ski mask and goggles his winter gear caked in ice

DONAL (CONTD)
The Brit thinks it’s over then
yells ‘God save the Queen’ and
throws the Irishman out in his
place

DONAL smiles at his own joke watching out of the corner of
his eye as WILSON drops his pack on the opposite bench and
begins undressing removing his jacket and shell leggings
before pulling off his mask

WILSON is in his late twenties with the cold blue eyes of
his Anglo-Saxon ancestors and stark features that suggest
he’s never smiled ever

WILSON
Evenin’

WILSON peels off his gloves rubbing his fingers before
retrieving a two-way radio from his pack DONAL and ERIC
exchange glances as he kneels at the edge of the circle of
firelight tuning for a frequency

ERIC
We are surrounded by three
thousand feet of solid granite
you cannot

WILSON stands moving the handheld unit about in the air
for better reception picking up a tangle of fragmented
signals

RADIO (MALE VOICE)
it’s pretty bad turning
back before someone has to
rescue us too out

The radio spits a stream of white noise and WILSON turns it
down to kill the static

DONAL
Who was that

WILSON
Mountain rescue searchin’ for an
aircraft that went down on the
hill behind us about three hours
ago

ERIC
(shocked)
Aircraft

WILSON
Executive jet two pilots five
passengers I picked up their
distress call just before the
storm

ERIC
We’ve got to do something

Unlacing his steaming boots WILSON begins to methodically
massage his toes

WILSON
Yeah We can sleep it out No
one’s going anywhere until this
wind drops

ERIC
And what if you found out
afterwards there were survivors
We can’t just leave them out
there

WILSON shrugs propping his feet on the hearth

WILSON
I know these mountains like the
back of my hand and we’re talking
white out conditions mate No-
one could make it through that
shit alive

DONAL nods soberly passing ERIC the joint

DONAL
Take the chill pill Eric Your
mans got a point

ERIC
I’m finding this a little
difficult

He closes up his laptop before taking a puff coughing at
the unfamiliar taste

WILSON
So don’t believe me Go see for
yourself Even if they did
survive the crash they’d be dead
by now Twice dead by the time
you reached ‘em

ERIC takes another hit on the joint holding it in this
time

ERIC
What makes you so sure

WILSON
Being sure is my business
laddie

WILSON glances sullenly back showing the Frenchman the
white of his eye Then something moves outside the cabin
and all three fall silent their gaze magnetized by the
twitching door handle

DONAL
The devil

Something scratches against the woodwork and an instant
later the door bursts open the flames dancing on the
hearth as a ghostly snow encrusted figure lunges into the
room an ice caked nylon rope trailing from its clenched
right hand

WILSON
The hell is this

WILSON starts from his seat ashen faced as MELISSA tears
off her goggles staring with wild pain maddened eyes at
the gaping trio

MELISSA
I have an injured woman here

ERIC goes to her aid helping her pull the improvised
sledge across the threshold

ERIC
That’s an aircraft door

WILSON avoids the Frenchman’s eyes his attention fixed on
MELISSA as she falls to her knees before the fire

WILSON
You found the wreck

MELISSA nods bowing her head the warmth sinking into her

DONAL
Jesus

WILSON
Alone

MELISSA
I came across the loch About a
quarter of a mile as the crow
flies

She watches as ERIC and DONAL unwrap CARLY from her
sleeping bag CARLY’s colour is bad and at first they
think she’s already dead but then her hand moves as they
lay her in front of the hearth

DONAL
Sweet Jesus

MELISSA starts to unfasten her pack but her fingers are too
numb to work the straps WILSON helps her and she silently
nods her thanks as she retrieves her medical kit

MELISSA
Got any analgesics And I’m
going to be needing hot water and
a needle and thread

The field dressing on CARLY’s leg is already soaked with
blood a red stain spreading through the lining of the
sleeping bag

WILSON
Is she the only survivor

MELISSA
No Someone else walked out of
there I saw tracks

ERIC returns with a couple of fresh towels and DONAL
relights the spliff as MELISSA scrubs down

ERIC
Coffee Anyone

MELISSA
Black Two sugars Thanks

The coffee is just the way she likes it Hot strong and
good She spoons in an extra serving of sugar relying on
the hyperglaecemic high to keep herself awake Reaching
for her pill dispenser MELISSA helps herself to 200
milligrams of Tryptizol throwing in a couple of Diconals
for general maintenance

DONAL watches her swallow his eyes narrowing as he takes a
closer look at the insignia on CARLY’s jacket The
ubiquitous all-seeing eye

DONAL
What is she A cop

MELISSA peels back the dressing not liking what she sees

CARLY is breathing softly and the lips of the wound tremble
rhythmically and gently in the harsh light of the single
lamp

MELISSA
Her name’s Carly

CARLY moans as if in vague recognition of her name the
first sound the trio have heard her utter

MELISSA (CONT’D)
She said she’s an air marshal but
judging from what I saw she’s
probably FBI

ERIC
I thought the FBI only operate
within American borders

MELISSA
CIA then I don’t know

She checks CARLY’s pulse and finding it weak but steady
prepares a needle snapping the neck off one of the
morphine ampoules

WILSON
Department of Homeland Security
The eye in the fucking pyramid

MELISSA
Sorry

WILSON
Homeland Security Some sort of
umbrella organization put
together under the anti-terrorism
laws As far as I remember
they’ve got a pretty wide
charter

MELISSA expertly administers the shot sitting back for a

moment as she waits for it to take effect How smooth and
subtle how complex the wound seems in the shifting amber

glow How vulnerable how irrevocably naked

WILSON (CONT’D)
They’re Rummy’s boys Licensed
to kill Licensed to do anything
they bloody like

CARLY sighs drifting into a deeper slumber Hunkering
closer MELISSA sets to work

DONAL
Yeah But what’s she doing in
Scotland

MELISSA

Right now she’s bleeding to death
and there’s nothing we can do
about it Not without the proper
tools

WILSON
You’ve got your needle and thread
and enough hot water We should
be able to make do

He places a hand on MELISSA’s shoulder but she draws away
busying herself with cleaning the wound and trying to
repair as much of the superficial damage as she can

MELISSA
Youd know I suppose

She glances uneasily at the sheathed hunting knife on
WILSON’s belt

WILSON
I’ve seen some lovely messes in
my time Including a few of my
own

He raises the right sleeve of his jacket to reveal a
patchwork of pale pink scar tissue

WILSON (CONT’D)
Third black watch Falluja
2004 Had to use superglue
Anyone got superglue

ERIC shakes his head watching silently as MELISSA does her
best to close the wound

WILSON (CONT’D)
Pity save us a trip

ERIC
You going somewhere

WILSON
Our doctor by default needs
medical supplies to save her
patient

ERIC
So off to the local hospital are
we

ERIC stands up with a look of incredulity Then he sits
down again realizing how stoned he is

MELISSA
How far is the nearest road

WILSON
About seven miles but in this
weather it’1l feel more like
seventy and there’s at least one
gorge along the way I wouldn’t
want to take in darkness

MELISSA
So we’re fucked basically
That’s what you’re saying

WILSON shakes his head slowly placing one hand over hers
helping to hold the folds of flesh in place as she sutures
the wound

WILSON
I’m betting that Homeland
Security plane carries some above
standard medical kit Not to
mention all kinds of other

goodies

MELISSA
Assuming the plane hasn’t sunk by
now

ERIC

Even if it’s there you’ll never
make it back No-one could
survive a storm like this Isn’t
that what you said

WILSON clambers to his feet and begins to hastily don his
kit leaving MELISSA to clean the suture and apply a fresh
dressing

WILSON
And when they tell you there were
medical supplies out there that
could have saved this lady How
will you feel then

ERIC
Shitty Now you mention it

WILSON
So come for the stroll I could
use the help

ERIC nods realizing he has no choice

DONAL
I hope you’re not looking at me

WILSON
Youre so ripped off your tits
youd be a liability out there

DONAL
Hey You should try some of this
shit It might help your
perspective

WILSON
I doubt it

WILSON snorts gathering an armful of distress flares

MELISSA
Gi’ us a blast then

DONAL blinks passing MELISSA the spliff She takes a
grateful toke admiring her handiwork for a moment before
covering CARLY with a dry blanket

DONAL
I mean you guys are about to go
out there and risk your lives for
a total stranger And a cop at
that

MELISSA
You got it Sherlock

She starts to rise reaching for her jacket but WILSON
gently restrains her

WILSON
Uh-uh We’re good

MELISSA
Since when were you in charge
here Mr Mr

WILSON

Wilson Craig Wilson And I’m
not in charge of anything
missie I just don’t have any
choice I’m a climbing
instructor not a doctor but like
it or not that woman’s life is in
my hands

MELISSA
You can call me Melissa and
you’re right You don’t have any
choice I’m coming with you

She takes another toke finding it surprisingly good

WILSON
Don’t be silly Stay put You
too Donal Do something you’re
good at like keeping an eye on
these ladies

MELISSA
Youll die out there without me

WILSON starts to say something but the words stick in his
throat as he sees the look in her eyes realizing she means
it

MELISSA
I know every inch of that trail
Every sodding inch

WILSON
I appreciate the concern but

MELISSA
And if you don’t make it she
won’t make it either

CARLY groans as MELISSA crouches beside the improvised
stretcher gathering in the nylon cord

ERIC
You have something in mind

MELISSA
Rope up and spread out until one
of us finds the plane Donal I
want you to take these flares
About five will do If we’re not
back in an hour I want you to
light them at ten minute
intervals Think you can do
that

DONAL
Shouldn’t I take a few more
Just in case

MELISSA
If we’re not back in two hours it
means we’re never coming back

WILSON and ERIC exchange an uneasy glance as she divides up
the remaining flares

MELISSA (CONT’D)
Any questions

WILSON
Yeah Are you out of your
fucking mind

MELISSA
You keep shoving your hand in
this cage Mr Wilson it’s going
to get bit

She passes the joint back to DONAL noticing something
close to awe in his bloodshot eyes

MELISSA (CONT’D)
Shit’s nice What is it

DONAL
Cut it with a little Salvia
Salvia Divenorum The Mayans
used to smoke it when they were
building Machu Pichu Good for
altitude sickness Good for
other things too

MELISSA
Definitely nice Just keep an
eye on the time now We’ll be
counting on you

WILSON watches dumbstruck as she threads the rope through
the carabiners on her belt feeding the other end to ERIC

WILSON
Okay So we’ll do it your way

MELISSA
If you find the plane give three
hard tugs After twenty minutes
well join up and double back
Any questions

WILSON sullenly shakes his head slipping on his ski mask
CARLY shivers as MELISSA opens the door emitting a low
sigh as if to remind her of her mission

MELISSA (CONT’D)
C’mon We’re wasting time

CUT TO

EXT THE BOTHY NIGHT

MELISSA surrenders herself to the blizzards embrace
feeling something close to relief as if the storm is her
natural habitat the only lover she can really trust

ERIC and WILSON watch as she takes a bearing on Nidge’s
compass making a series of silent calculations

MELISSA
Take it as far east as you can
Mr Wilson You take west Mr
Mister

ERIC
Renault Eric Renault

MELISSA
You take west Mr Renault
Steady pace

They nod the group dispersing into the wall of wind driven
snow spreading out into the night

CUT TO

INT THE BOTHY NIGHT

CARLY moans her quavering voice almost lost beneath the
keening of the wind in the rafters their lamentations
intermingling so that DONAL can no longer tell where one
begins and the other ends

Settling himself beside the hearth he begins to nervously
build another joint speaking aloud to break the silence
and keep the stricken woman company grateful at least for
the captive audience

DONAL
Stop me if you’ve heard this
before but there’s a Frenchman a
Yank a Brit and an Irishman on
this aeroplane that’s about to
crash see

EXT FROZEN LOCH NIGHT

MELISSA walks into the storm the nylon rope running from
her left and right hands as she presses against the wind
It is an eerie sight with the rope floating away from her
as if somehow levitating

CUT TO

INT THE BOTHY NIGHT

CARLY’s lips move trying to form words cocooned in the
scented darkness of MELISSA’s sleeping bag in that void
that’s highly embraceable during sleep

She vaguely feels the fire on her face hearing the
Irishman’s lilting voice through a warm opiate haze

DONAL
And the captain says ‘I’ve got
some bad news for you’

CUT TO

EXT FROZEN LOCH NIGHT

MELISSA feels a sharp tug on the line and a moment later
catches sight of the aircraft’s nose section protruding
from the shattered ice

WILSON is standing in the lee of the wreck and MELISSA and
ERIC join him huddling in the shelter of the fuselage
where the wind and snow are a little more bearable

WILSON
At least she’s still afloat

ERIC
Only just How deep is the loch

MELISSA
About three hundred feet

ERIC turns his flashlight to the nearest hatchway a good
ten feet above the ice

ERIC
How do we reach it without a
ladder

WILSON

The army way Use half the rope
throw it through the open hatch
and haul me up from the other
side

MELISSA
Don’t you think the lightest
person should be the one to go
aboard

ERIC
Shes right Sixty pounds could
be the difference to send it
under
WILSON looks unhappy but cannot escape the logic

WILSON
Have it your way

CUT TO

INT FUSELAGE NIGHT

Something moves inside the wreck shifting away from the
probing flashlight beams

There is a sound like a sigh

CUT TO

EXT FROZEN LOCH NIGHT

MELISSA makes the rope fast

WILSON
If it moves we’re pulling so be
ready

MELISSA

Okay okay I’m ready
She pauses seeing the look on WILSON’s face

MELISSA (CONT’D)
What

He makes as if to pat her on the shoulder but then changes
his mind turning to ERIC who is already taking up the
slack on the far side of the wreck

MELISSA gives them the thumbs up and the guys put their
backs into it her boots scrabbling against the sheer icy
fuselage Then her gloved fingers gain purchase on the
hatchway and she pulls herself up and in

CUT TO

INT FUSELAGE NIGHT

The cabin lurches beneath MELISSA’s weight slipping
another couple of feet into the icy tarn Catching hold of
the back of a chair she steadies herself against the
incline

MELISSA
Gimme some slack

She scans the slanting aisle with her flashlight The man
in the window seat is no longer moving head hanging
forward like an abandoned crash dummy

Feeling a queasy sense of relief MELISSA turns her
attention to the overhead lockers finding one bearing the
sign of the caduceus two snakes coiling around a staff
the logo of the American Medical Association Inside she
discovers a hefty black suitcase containing all the
supplies she needs enough to keep Carly alive until dawn
at least

EXT FROZEN LOCH NIGHT

The two men step closer to the wreck as MELISSA appears in
the doorway above them

MELISSA
Careful It’s heavy

WILSON opens his arms and she drops it down to him She is
about to follow when she pauses hearing what might be a
low moan coming from behind her A trick of the wind
perhaps

WILSON
C’mon What are you waiting for

MELISSA
Thought I heard something

WILSON
What

She cups her hands to her mouth trying to shout above the
storm the wind snatching away her words

MELISSA
Heard something Just hold on

WILSON shakes his head helplessly watching as she vanishes
back into the fuselage

ERIC
What’s going on I don’t
understand

WILSON
You’re not the only one mate
And the more I do understand the
less I bloody like it

CUT TO

INT FUSELAGE NIGHT

MELISSA starts back through the compartment using the
headrests for handholds In her haste she accidentally
catches hold of the protruding human arm she came across a
few hours ago Letting out a startled yelp she loses
balance slipping to one knee in the tilting aisle Then
regaining her composure she catches sight of a steel case
wedged beneath one of the seats

The case contains a pair of night viewing goggles and
slipping them over her head MELISSA thumbs a switch
hearing a sound like a camera charging

The interior of the cabin abruptly leaps into heightened
relief the lurid green glare of the night sites stripping
back the shadows

She turns to face the man in the window seat freezing in
her tracks as she sees a ghostly luminescence gleaming from
beneath his half open lids MELISSA catches her breath
taking a beat to realize it is only a side effect of the
image enhancement the agent’s glazed eyeballs kicking back
the residual light in the cabin like tiny mirrors Working
her way closer to him MELISSA searches in vain for his
fallen gun

The front of the compartment is already flooded the
contents of the fallen briefcase floating before her on an
inky tide MELISSA crouches scooping up a handful of
soggy photographs trying to get a closer look at the
ghastly images they contain The faces of the dead and the
mutilated so many of them some so badly disfigured they
are barely recognizable as human

CUT TO

EXT FROZEN LOCH NIGHT

It has been a good forty minutes since ERIC left the

shelter of the bothy and the cold is already seeping into
his bones his fingers and toes numbing the wind roaring
so loud about his ears he can scarcely hear himself think

A gloved hand falls on his shoulder and he spins to find
WILSON huddling beside him gesturing frantically towards a
bobbing red light that has appeared in the middle distance
weaving like a will o’ the whisp through the curtain of
snow

WILSON
(shouting)
Someone’s out there Looks like
a flare

ERIC
But it’s too early for Donal

WILSON
And it’s coming from the wrong
bloody direction

ERIC narrows his eyes trying to shield his goggles against
the blizzard

ERIC
Perhaps it’s a search party

WILSON shakes his head slowly one hand falling to the hilt
of his knife

WILSON
Time we got to the bottom of
this don’t you think

He starts into the night eyes turned towards the dancing
flame

ERIC
Where are you going Wilson

The young sound designer thinks it over Then he lets go
of the rope and gives chase

ERIC (CONTD)
Hey

CUT TO

INT THE BOTHY NIGHT

DONAL fixes himself another coffee keeping one eye on the
door as he nervously checks his watch

DONAL
Come on guys This is getting
silly

He starts to lay out the flares trying to get his head
around the safety instructions utterly oblivious to the
shape that moves silently behind him a silhouetted figure
outlined momentarily against the firelight

DONAL (CONT’D)
You know how much I hate being
alone

CUT TO

INT FUSELAGE NIGHT

The dripping photographs have the same fascination as a car
wreck and try as she might MELISSA cannot look away The
unfamiliar sights are not easily comprehended Violent
death makes visible what was never meant to be seen The
glistening innards the secret apparatus beneath the skin

Several prints have the same unintelligible word scrawled
on the back A name perhaps

MELISSA
Lorcus

She shivers glancing over her shoulder at the open
hatchway half convinced she heard a man’s voice shouting
somewhere out in the dark

CUT TO

EXT FROZEN LOCH NIGHT

ERIC yells at the top of his lungs pushing into the teeth
of the storm WILSON’s figure dwindling into a grey blur up
ahead boots punching through the hoarfrost

ERIC
Hey Come back

He tries to turn around but the wreck is lost in the
darkness leaving him no choice but to keep going forward
Grinding his teeth he forces himself on seeing the grey
blur grow slowly closer the flurrying curtain parting long
enough to reveal a running hooded figure outlined against
the dancing light less than a hundred yards ahead of him

ERIC
Wilson

But it isn’t Wilson

CUT TO

INT THE BOTHY NIGHT

DONAL gathers up the first of the flares pulling on an old
Soviet army issue ballaclava before turning to fetch his
mittens

He catches his breath as he sees CARLY sitting bolt
upright beside the fire staring at him with her strange
haunted eyes

DONAL
Uhhh

CARLY
Where am I

She blinks a little confused by the red star on DONAL’s
cap

DONAL
(stammering)
Loch Tullish The others have
gone to fetch help

CARLY
Youve got to stop them You’ve
got to warn them

The wind howls lie a hungry wolf at the doorstep and CARLY
shudders drawing the sleeping bag tighter about herself

DONAL
What are you talking about Warn
them about what

CARLY
They don’t know what’s out
there

CUT TO

INT FUSELAGE NIGHT

The man in the last few photographs might almost be
handsome his features softened by a mane of shoulder
length blonde hair and a whispy growth of beard his eyes
like hell and the blue sky all at once

In some of the pictures he is alone while in others he is
accompanied by a veiled woman her face hidden save for
those dark half familiar eyes

In one photograph they stand on the lip of a mass grave a
line of unfamiliar mountains rising behind them and
although the man wears a threadbare military jacket and an
Afghan pachul his face and colouring mark him as a
Westerner In another they seem to be leading a crouched
sub-human figure on a leash

Turning the print MELISSA finds a name stencilled on the
back the first full name she has seen

MELISSA
Richard Lorcus aka ‘the
falconer’ aka ‘Richard al-
Rahim’ the mercy of God

Just then someone raps on one of the laminated windows
close to the waterline and MELISSA turns to see a gloved
hand wiping the snow from the glass

MELISSA
(shouting)
I’1l1 be out in a minute

The gloved hand offers a thumbs up and she drops the
photograph her eyes lighting on what she has been looking
for all along

The agent’s gun lies barely an arms length away outlined
in the green glow of her nightsights

Breathing a sigh of relief she reaches towards it

CUT TO

EXT FROZEN LOCH NIGHT

A shadowy figure circles the hole in the ice to find a
window almost completely submerged in the dark water

Placing an ice axe against the glass the hooded newcomer
prepares to strike

CUT TO

INT FUSELAGE NIGHT

MELISSA grabs the gun crying out as the window next to her
head explodes violently inwards followed by a spume of icy
water the fuselage sharply increasing its angle as the
nose section settles into the loch

MELISSA
WHAT’RE YOU DOING

MELISSA catches hold of one of the seats her feet kicking
in thin air the nearest exit now directly overhead more
than thirty feet away

She catches a fleeting glimpse of the gloved hand as it
reappears at one end of the windows wavering goodbye

Then with a loud bang the cockpit door bursts from its
hinges a fountain of debris and freezing water spraying
towards her face the twisted uniformed corpses of the two
pilots rising to greet her pale broken limbs flailing in
the current

MELISSA shoves the gun into her belt beginning a desperate
scramble for her life using the vertical seat row as a
ladder

CUT TO

EXT FROZEN LOCH NIGHT

The remains of the aircraft are sinking fast sliding into
the foaming tarn at the rate of about a foot a second

It would be a dramatic sight if there was anyone there to
see it

CUT TO

INT FUSELAGE NIGHT

By the time MELISSA reaches the last few rows an icy
maelstrom is already swirling about her ankles and in the
green glow of her goggles she can see from the surrounding
windows that the water level outside is already well above
her head

MELISSA
Cmon faster faster

She grabs the corner of the hatchway as water from the
outside comes pouring and with a barely human cry hurls
herself up and out into the freezing night

MELISSA (CONT’D)
FASTER

CUT TO

EXT FROZEN LOCH NIGHT

MELISSA leaps clear slamming hard against the ice and
crawling desperately away on her hands and knees as the
remains of the fuselage settle from view

She makes it about thirty feet before standing up and
casting about for her companions

MELISSA
Wilson Eric Hullo
THE FUCK IS EVERYONE

WHERE

Then without warning she finds herself knocked flat
hitting the snow face first as if felled by an invisible
fist Within seconds she is sliding inexorably back across
the ice towards the churning cauldron

Only then does she realize the thin nylon rope attached to
her waist harness has become snagged in the sinking
wreckage dragging her after it

MELISSA (CONT’D)
NO

She manages to unclip the harness about twenty feet from
the ice hole sliding another five feet or more as it
unravels only for the rope to become entangled about her
left arm pulling her over onto her back and drawing tight

MELISSA (CONT’D)
Ah fuck you

Out of the corner of one eye she sees a hooded figure
emerging from the tempest at a run a Scots hunting knife
known as a skean d’hu glinting in the poisonous green glow
of her night viewing goggles

MELISSA (CONT’D)
GOD

She winces crying out as the man leaps towards her
landing astride her and severing the rope with a single
well placed blow

WILSON
Always - carry - a - knife

WILSON yanks off his mask to reveal his craggy smiling
face It is the first time MELISSA has seen him smile and
it is not an attractive sight

MELISSA
Get to fuck

She pushes him off struggling to her feet to find she is
only inches from the churning abyss

WILSON
Hey don’t be like that

MELISSA
Where the fuck were you

WILSON
I was lost in the snow I
watch out

The corpse of one of the pilots bursts from the water
flung upwards by a gout of escaping air and MELISSA yelps
in surprise almost losing her footing WILSON manages to
get one arm around her drawing her back from the brink
This time she does not resist

CARLY (VO)
I thought I was dead

CUT TO

INT THE BOTHY NIGHT

CARLY lies back studying the shifting pattern of light and
shadow that flicker across the rafters as DONAL prepares
another needle

CARLY
Dead and gone to heaven Either
that or the other place

DONAL
Worse than that I’m afraid
You’re in fekking Scotland

CARLY
Youre no angel either right

DONAL leans over her the syringe glinting in his hand

DONAL
If you close one eye perhaps At
least I know how to administer a
shot

CARLY
Lifetime of experience I suppose

She closes her eyes as DONAL drives the needle home

DONAL
Maybe Ill join you It’s a
pretty wild night for a morphine
party wouldn’t you say

CARLY
Mmmmm That’s so nice

DONAL
That’s a helluva shot I just gave
you I know guys who’d sell
their own mothers for a shot like
that

Tucking CARLY into the sleeping bag he turns to gather his
coat

CARLY
What are you doing

DONAL
Time I let off some fireworks

CARLY relaxes into the high a blissed out smile lighting
up her face

CARLY
I love fireworks

CUT TO

EXT FROZEN LOCH NIGHT

MELISSA clutches Nidge’s compass in one hand leading
WILSON through the void their movements made heavy and
laborious by the deepening snow

MELISSA
You alright

WILSON
Just tired

MELISSA

We’ve got to keep going

WILSON’s eyes search the whirling curtain that encloses
them unable to shake the sensation that they are wandering
in widening circles

WILSON
Going where

MELISSA pauses for him to catch up and as she glances back
WILSON sees a flare appear in the distance like an
incandescent star hovering above her left shoulder

MELISSA
We’re going home All of us

CUT TO

EXT THE BOTHY NIGHT

The flare gives good value and for the first time since the
storm closed in DONAL starts to feel he’s getting on top of
the situation

He stands roughly a hundred feet in front of the bothy the
burning torch thrust aloft the ruddy glare leaping out
before him driving back the dark a solitary flickering
light in a benighted alien landscape

Looking up DONAL sees a funnel of eddying sparks red as
drops of blood frozen by the sudden light as if suspended
in a vast motionless amber For a moment he feels almost
happy a childish grin creasing his unshaven face

In the ballaclava he looks like a novelty paperweight a
berserk socialist parody of the statue of liberty

Sensing another pair of eyes upon him DONAL turns catching
a fleeting silhouette etched against the skyline a
hunched shape slinking rapidly away into the shadows as if
repelled by the light disappearing behind the bothy’s
slanting roof before he can fully focus on it

Then the flare sputters and dies DONAL’s confidence dying
with it as the night comes rushing in with renewed
intensity

DONAL
Ah shite

Hot metal hisses against slush as he lets the canister
fall standing stock still so his eyes can readjust the
after-image of that crawling figure burned into his
retinas

Gingerly retracing his steps DONAL pulls open the door of
the bothy only to be met by a blast of smoke and hot
choking air

DONAL (CONT’D)
Hey

CUT TO

INT THE BOTHY NIGHT

CARLY splutters struggling dazedly to extricate herself
from the sleeping bag a greasy plume of smoke belching
from the fireplace

DONAL appears behind her grabbing the corner of the bag
and dragging her back from the hearth

CARLY
What’s happening

DONAL
Snow’s blocking the chimney vent
I think

CARLY wipes her streaming eyes as DONAL wedges the door
with his pack The smoke drains from the room the last of
the hot air going with it

CARLY
One fucking thing after another

DONAL
We’ve got to clear that flue

He retrieves his joint relighting it as he surveys the
rafters trying not to think about that creeping
silhouette

DONAL (CONTD)
I think there’s a hatch up there
leading to the roof

CARLY
Kind of a weird time to get high
don’t you think

She shivers settling back into the bag as the young
Irishman scales a wooden ladder disappearing into the
loft

DONAL
Thing is with Salvia it helps you
know stuff before it happens
Kind of like second sight
That’s why they call it Salvia
Divenorum

He shuffles on his elbows and knees through the musty
crawlspace finding an ancient trapdoor set in the slanting
roof

CARLY (0S)
Will you stop talking shit I’m
freezing my tits off down here

DONAL pushes against the trapdoor with his shoulder only to
find it frozen solid

DONAL
Like this is preordained Like I
could’ve seen it coming

Lying with his back to the rafters he braces the soles of
his boots against the hatch

DONAL (CONTD)
Getting stuck on this fekking
mountain

He kicks upwards as hard as he can forcing the trapdoor
open about half an inch The temperature is falling fast
and CARLY draws herself deeper into the sleeping bag
trying to make herself as small as possible only half
hearing DONAL’s words

DONAL (CONTD)
I boarded a boat to Dublin and
ended up in Aberdeen

CARLY
Could’ve happened to anyone I
guess

DONAL pushes again snow cascading in around him as he
flings the trap wide

DONAL
Took it as a sign Just said
‘what the hell see what sweet
fate befalls you Donal’

EXT ROOF NIGHT

DONAL pops his head out of the hatch feeling the kiss of
the night air

DONAL
And here I am

He frowns noticing a length of canvas tied around the
chimney stack deliberately blocking the vent Then before
he can cry out a pair of gloved hands grasp him by his face
and throat dragging him violently up and out into the dark
his feet dancing a silent jig in the icy wind

CUT TO

EXT FROZEN LOCH NIGHT

WILSON sits in the snow listening to the incessant howling
of the blizzard his head propped against his knees as
MELISSA scans the horizon with her goggles waiting in vain
for the second flare

MELISSA
Come on Where the hell is he

WILSON
Something must’ve happened

MELISSA drags on his sleeve trying to get him upright

MELISSA
Weve got to go

WILSON
Lemme rest for a while

MELISSA
No We’ve got to go

He wordlessly shoulders the kit allowing MELISSA to take
his hand leading him on through the dark her goggles
straining against the gloom

MELISSA (CONT’D)
I think I can see our tracks

CUT TO

INT THE BOTHY NIGHT

CARLY sighs catching the acrid smell of paraffin She
tries to open her eyes but their lids seem impossibly
heavy

She senses something coming between her and the light half
aware of the white garbed newcomer as he douses the
furniture around her with the contents of one of the fuel

cans Then crouching beside her he touches her hair with
his blood stained fingertips

LORCUS
Sssshhhh

CUT TO

EXT FROZEN LOCH NIGHT

A pillar of fire lights up the night so bright through the
night viewing goggles it is almost blinding

MELISSA
C’mon

She wrenches the goggles from her face the greasy orange
flames so close now she can see them with the naked eye

WILSON
What is it

Summoning the last of her strength MELISSA forges a thigh
deep path through the snow WILSON floundering after her

MELISSA
Oh God C’mon

CUT TO

EXT THE BOTHY NIGHT

The stone walls act as a massive flue the wind fanning the
blazing cottage funnelling the flames upwards and away
into the night in a swarm of angry sparks

WILSON
Ah Christ We’re fucked

WILSON reels dazedly to a halt beside MELISSA the two of
them staring helplessly at the burning ruin the bothy’s
blackened walls outlined against the inferno like a
grinning fractured skull

WILSON (CONT’D)
We’re seriously fuckin’ fucked

Someone coughs and with a surge of relief MELISSA sees
CARLY huddled in her sleeping bag at a safe distance from
the fire her curled semi-conscious form barely
distinguishable in the half-light

MELISSA
What happened

She kneels beside CARLY in the snow discovering her pack
and the remaining syringes have been carefully set aside
from the blaze

MELISSA (CONT’D)
Where’s Donal

CARLY groans cowering away from her too disorientated to
recognize her voice

WILSON
That daft Irish prat I’11
bloody kill him

MELISSA
I think someone already has

She puts one arm around CARLY drawing her shivering body
closer so she can share her warmth

WILSON
What are you talking about

MELISSA
The mercy of God

CARLY opens her eyes looking up at MELISSA as if from the
bottom of a well seeing her tangled auburn hair outlined
by a halo of fire

CARLY
You really are an angel

MELISSA
Lorcus was here wasn’t he He
did this

CARLY nods half in and half out of a dream feeling the
warmth of the flames against her face not knowing how she
could be burning and freezing all at once

WILSON
Who the fuck is Lorcus

CARLY sees WILSON’s anxious frost bitten face peering over
MELISSA’s shoulder and behind him the outline of a hooded
figure emerging from the whirling darkness a spectral
shape as pale as the driven snow

CARLY
Behind you

WILSON blinks as MELISSA turns drawing the dead homeland
security man’s service pistol from her belt and levelling
it at the unseen figure behind him

WILSON
The fuck

He dives towards her instinctively raising one hand to
protect himself the muzzle flash almost blinding him as
she fires over his shoulder the first shot going wide

The frost encrusted newcomer flings himself face forward
into the snow as MELISSA tries to draw a bead on him but
before she can squeeze off another round WILSON catches her
wrist bending her arm backwards

MELISSA
No Let go of me

She sinks her teeth into WILSON’s forearm and he curses
backhanding her across the face and wrenching the gun from
her clumsy frozen fingers

WILSON
Sorry ‘bout that lassie but you
had it comin’

The hooded figure behind him regains its footing arms
upraised

ERIC
Connas

WILSON
That you Eric I thought you
were dead

The young sound designer pulls off his goggles tentatively
stepping closer

ERIC
I’m not but I might’ve been You
nearly blew my head off

WILSON
So Where were you

ERIC
Lost Then I saw the light Now
Im wishing I’d stayed lost

ERIC stares at the flames trying to take it all in The
burning bothy and WILSON calmly holding the gun on the
girls

ERIC (CONTD)
Don’t suppose anyone bothered
saving my laptop

WILSON shakes his head meeting MELISSA’s gaze as she
coolly wipes the blood from her swollen lip with the back
of her hand

WILSON
Time you explained yourself
don’t you think A little
honesty might go a long way right
now

ERIC
I had a weeks worth of samples on
that drive

MELISSA
And you might be the angriest
sack of shit I’ve ever met Mr
Wilson What happened to you
over there anyway In Iraq or
wherever the hell it was

WILSON
I’m the one asking the questions
cunt

CARLY
Wow

MELISSA

Survivor guilt

WILSON
My squad came under fire from a
yank gunship They died I
lived No guilt Just anger

CARLY
Figures

CARLY winces as WILSON cocks the pistol steadying it at
MELISSA’s unblinking eyes

WILSON
What they call ‘friendly fire’

ERIC
Hey cool it This isn’t helping
anyone

WILSON
Who’s Lorcus I’m not asking
again

MELISSA

Some kind of criminal I saw his
file on the plane

CARLY
All I know is we were meant to
pick up an American citizen in
Belfast and escort him stateside
for interrogation He’s what
they refer to as a ‘person of
interest’

MELISSA
Which explains why we never heard
about him on the news

WILSON
And now he’s out there right
This ‘person of interest’
That’s what you’re trying to tell
me He’s out there picking us
off like fish in a bloody
bucket

ERIC
I don’t get it How can he
survive in these conditions
We’re talking zero visibility

MELISSA
Probably likes it that way He’s
trained for these conditions
According to the file he was
deployed in Afghanistan and
Chechnya before changing sides
and going indie

WILSON
Going insane you mean He walks
the path of the psycho

WILSON slowly lowers the gun slipping it back onto safety
as he glances warily about himself

MELISSA
He likes the snow It’s his
natural habitat

WILSON
So why doesn’t he just fuck off
and leave us alone

MELISSA
Because he needs us Because he
fell out of the sky and doesn’t
know where the hell he is He
can’t afford to wait for light
because with the light comes the
police Probably more CIA or
Homeland Security or whatever you
guys call yourselves these
days

CARLY
That’s why he burned the cabin
To stop us from sitting out the
storm He needs us to show him
the way out of here

WILSON
Except there is no way out of
here Not until morning

MELISSA ferrets in her jacket for the waterproof container
holding the map

MELISSA
No way down perhaps

ERIC paces silently doing the math

ERIC
It’s only just gone one First
light won’t show until seven In
another hour or so we start to
freeze Unless we keep moving

WILSON
What are you people talking
about

MELISSA

We have to go up to get down

She unfolds the map and the others gather round trying to
make sense of the whorls and contours

MELISSA (CONT’D)
If we circle the loch and cut
across the piste we’ll gain about
five hundred meters From there
on it’s only another five hundred
meters across reasonably good
snow to the summit

ERIC
And the ski station With a bit
of luck we might be able to get
above the storm Either way once
were out of the valley we should
be able to call for help

The sound designer checks his mobile relieved to find
there’s still enough juice in the batteries to make this a
going proposition

WILSON
Think you can get a signal on
that thing

ERIC
If we had the laptop we could’ve
sent an e-mail Should be as
you say ‘a piece of cake’

WILSON
For us maybe But what about
her She can’t even walk

MELISSA inches closer to CARLY tightening her grip on her
hand

MELISSA
Then we’ll carry her Either way
well have to stabilize her
first He seems to have left us
everything we need

CARLY
That’s what he wanted That’s
why he left me alive

ERIC
What are you talking about

CARLY
Classic fieldcraft Leaving one
of the enemy maimed to slow down
the others His way of keeping
us on a tight leash

WILSON checks the clip on the automatic indignation
sparking in his eyes

WILSON
Well I’m tired of being the prey

MELISSA
Ah Jesus Don’t even think of
going out there looking for him

WILSON
Last thing he’d expect Right

MELISSA
All that matters now is for us to
stay awake stay together and
stay alive Split up and we die
You know that

She retrieves the medical kit laying out the necessary
supplies beside the sleeping bag

MELISSA (CONT’D)
Now I’m going to need a little
help here You had any medical
experience Mr Renault

ERIC
Actually I’m a sound engineer
At least I was until my laptop
went up in smoke

MELISSA
Good enough Better clean your
hands first

WILSON
What about Lorcus

MELISSA
He’s going to have to wait isn’t
he We’ve got about an hour

WILSON
I’m not afraid of that son of a
bitch

CARLY

You should be

A blood curdling barely human shriek rises above the white
noise of the storm and WILSON spins staring downwind into
the dark seeing nothing

WILSON
The fuck

The voice cries out again Although scarcely intelligible
it still carries the faint trace of an Irish accent

DONAL (0S)
GOD

ERIC
It’s Donal He’s out there

WILSON
You stay with her I’11 deal
with it

CARLY

Again textbook fieldcraft

MELISSA
She’s right You’re playing into
his hands

DONAL (0S)
GOD HELP ME

WILSON does up his hood trying to get a fix on the
screams

WILSON
Ill be the judge of that
CARLY
Split up and we die You heard
her
DONAL (0S)
JESUS
WILSON

Better hang on to this then

ERIC and CARLY stare dumbfoundedly at WILSON as he hands
MELISSA the service pistol

WILSON (CONT’D)
Youll be needing it more than
me If you’re right If this
really is a decoy to draw me
out

MELISSA
Don’t be crazy

DONAL (0S)
HELP MEEE

Donal’s cries taper off into a prolonged wail long and
thin as a vein WILSON turns away drawing his skean d’hu
the warrior glimmer in his eyes growing wayward blind and
bright

WILSON
Prefer me knife see More
intimate that way

He shows off the blade twelve inches of steel glinting in
the firelight

CARLY
Boys and their fuckin’ toys

WILSON
Stick with what you know That’s
what I say

MELISSA
Wilson

She reaches out touching his sleeve as if to draw him
back

WILSON
What

MELISSA
Stay alive

Taking off her night viewing goggles she presses them into
his hand

WILSON
You too

He smiles Then pulling on the goggles he marches knife in
hand into the dark

ERIC
Crazy son of a bitch

MELISSA
Well he’s not a sane person and
he’s not very bright Sometimes
people do crazy things They
take a chance to help their
friends Haven’t you ever done
something like that

Placing the gun in easy reach she begins to gingerly unpick
the dressing on CARLY’s leg

ERIC
Yes and no I mean I don’t know
what that guy’s doing or why he’s
doing it I don’t know what I’m
doing or why I’m doing it or what
it’s like

CUT TO

EXT GLEN NIGHT

WILSON adjusts the goggles striding through a netherworld
of fluorescent snowflakes

He slows catching sight of tracks and a hundred yards or
so further on sees a figure kneeling in the snow like a
penitent sinner gloved hands clasped as if in prayer

WILSON
Donal That you man

He edges closer knife at the ready recognizing the red
star on the Irishman’s ballaclava

WILSON (CONT’D)
Hey

He places one hand on the kneeling figure’s shoulder and
DONAL manages to get his head around far enough for WILSON
to realize he is bound and gagged hands tied at the
wrists eyes bulging in panic

WILSON (CONT’D)
Fuck

DONAL is trying to yell something staring past him into
the storm and WILSON turns realizing his mistake

There is a man standing behind him less than an arm’s
reach away a tall figure in a hooded white parka a flare
clenched in one hand and a length of reinforced steel chain
dangling from the other

WILSON (CONT’D)
You

Then LORCUS ignites the flare and WILSON cries out his
goggles intensifying the light wiping away his vision ina
blaze of blinding green iridescence

LORCUS
You’re dead

WILSON raises his hands to tear off the goggles and the
tall man lunges forward driving a jagged aluminium shank
into his inner thigh

WILSON doubles up the breath leaving him in a pained
animal grunt his assailant grasping his flailing knife
hand and bending it effortlessly behind his back twisting
the skean d’hu from his clutching fingers

WILSON
No

DONAL moans thrashing from side to side as he chafes
against his bonds

Wrenching the shank from WILSON’s maimed thigh LORCUS
tosses him aside as if he were a sack of dirty laundry
administering a vicious side-kick to his head to shut him
up while he attends to the Irishman

DONAL stares wide eyed at his own terrified reflection
caught for an instant in the glinting skean d’hu still
trying to understand how the fates could have betrayed him
so how all his dreams could have lead to this shitty
frozen ditch

The edge of the blade is like ice against his throat so
cold he barely feels the incision the snow reddening about
him as his lifeblood steams away into the endless night

CUT TO

EXT THE BOTHY NIGHT

CARLY moans as MELISSA strips back the sodden gauze gently
probing the wound

MELISSA
Can you feel that

CARLY
Lotta pain

MELISSA
I can take the pain away You
want that

She nods watching MELISSA snap the neck off another
ampoule ERIC crouches beside her holding the flashlight
one eye on the guttering flames

ERIC
We haven’t got long
Temperature’s dropping fast

CARLY
Melissa

MELISSA
Keep the torch steady

CARLY gazes at her as she administers the injection the
pieces of the puzzle slowly falling into place

CARLY
You know his name The name of
the prisoner

MELISSA
Don’t talk Not now

CARLY
But you haven’t told me what
your’e doing here An animal
doctor with all this shit in your
bag

MELISSA
I’11 tell you later

CARLY
You came here to die didn’t you

MELISSA
So what if I did

She smiles squeezing CARLY’s hand as the anaesthetic
begins to take effect

CARLY
Well you sure picked the place
for it

MELISSA

Ssshh It’s going to be alright
I promise

CARLY closes her eyes surrendering to the high

CARLY
At least you won’t be going
alone

CUT TO

EXT GLEN NIGHT

RICHARD LORCUS crouches over his prey going through the
dead man’s pockets scavenging anything that might get him
through the night coming away with little more than a
spare lighter a pouch of herbal rolling tobacco and a
fistful of dubious looking uppers

WILSON lies shivering in the snow a few feet away from
DONAL’s corpse one hand gripping his wounded thigh hot
fluid pulsing between his fingers He is losing body
temperature as well as plasma what was once held warmly in
his veins pooling into the snow already becoming ice

WILSON
Oh shit shit

He notices the discarded shank lying beside him in the
slush and gritting his teeth inches towards it reaching
out with one sticky blood dewed hand

Then LORCUS is upon him once more the skean d’hu
descending in a shining arc slicing clean through the palm
of WILSON’s hand pinning it hard against the frozen earth

WILSON (CONT’D)
AAAHHH FUCK YOU COCKSUCKER

LORCUS
I severed your artery Your
brain will starve of oxygen
Try to relax Try to go with
it

WILSON
You fuck

WILSON turns on his side glaring up at the masked figure
standing over him

LORCUS
Ssshh Sleep now It’s better
that way

For the first time WILSON starts to feel afraid

WILSON

The fuck d’you think you are
LORCUS

Call me Richard It’s my real

name

WILSON raises his head as if to spit a final insult but the
words stick in his throat

A great tremor runs through his body and he lets his head
fall backwards snow settling in his upturned eyes

LORCUS waits for the life to go out of him before bending
to examine WILSON’s pockets hoping for better pickings
this time

It is his first real mistake of the evening

Catching his breath WILSON sits up as hard as he can his
forehead connecting with LORCUS’s face in a resounding
crack LORCUS reels backwards staying on his feet for an
instant Then a ribbon of blood and mucous slides from his
nose and he pitches backwards into a snowdrift

WILSON
And you call that a ‘Glasgow
Kiss’ cunt

Grasping the hilt of the skean d’hu with his left hand
WILSON pulls himself free trying not to cringe as pain
ripples through his body Stripping off his belt he
fastens it about his calf to form an improvised tourniquet
before advancing on his stunned opponent

WILSON (CONT’D)
Cmon you big girl’s blouse

But LORCUS doesn’t hear him

WILSON (CONT’D)
I ain’t finished with you yet

WILSON shakes his head feeling dizzy
Slipping to one knee he vomits explosively into the slush

CUT TO

EXT THE BOTHY NIGHT

CARLY’s face looks almost tranquil pale as porcelain in
the waning light

MELISSA
I think we stopped the bleeding
Shes just so cold

ERIC
She’s not the only one We
should get moving soon

MELISSA
Have to abandon the pack

ERIC checks his watch as MELISSA ferrets through her bag
setting aside the remaining ampoules

MELISSA (CONT’D)
You want to eat first Before we
go

ERIC
What about the others

MELISSA
You feel like going out there and
looking for them Mr Mister
ERIC

Eric The sound man Remember

MELISSA
Of course I’m sorry Eric

Forcing herself upright MELISSA begins to grope for hot
stones and bits of debris piling them around CARLY’s feet

ERIC
What are you doing

MELISSA
Stones hold back heat Like a
sauna Might buy us time

ERIC
You think it’s worth it Waiting
I mean

She nods silently gathering stones

ERIC (CONTD)
You’re the boss

ERIC bends to help digging out a sort of nest from the
rubble in the most sheltered corner they can find

MELISSA
Suppose you came out here for the
peace and quiet

ERIC
Ambience mostly I grew up in
the Ariege in mountains like
these Of course I do most of my
work out of a studio in the
seventh arrondissment nowadays
It’s a lot more comfortable

There is a smell of singeing flesh and she realizes one of
the embers is burning her hand but she holds on to it
anyway too numb to feel pain

ERIC
You play any instruments

MELISSA
Not really Some guitar

ERIC
What about Lorcus What if he
comes back

MELISSA
Let him come

MELISSA settles herself beside CARLY propping her back
against the charred wall trying to soak up the residual
warmth

MELISSA (CONT’D)
We’re both too wasted to do
anything about it

ERIC
Rest for a while then

MELISSA
Yeah A while

CUT TO

EXT GLEN NIGHT

WILSON opens his eyes not knowing when or where he is
knowing only that he has to get up

He starts to turn only to find LORCUS is already on his
feet driving the knife from his hand with a single well
placed kick

WILSON is too phased to even curse

Instead something like a snarl escapes his lips as he
launches himself headlong at his opponent striking LORCUS
in the midriff and bringing him down the two of them
rolling over together in the snow gouging kicking and
punching each striving silently for the advantage

LORCUS is a big man but WILSON has just enough jujitsu to
get him in a neck hold grappling his adversary onto his
chest and throttling him steadily into submission

WILSON
Just try to go with it

LORCUS reaches down with his left hand undoing WILSON’s
tourniquet The wound is deep and blood comes at once
Gritting his teeth WILSON grinds the big man’s head into
the slush trying to choke the life from him before the
strength goes out of his fingers

WILSON (CONT’D)
Yer murdering prat

LORCUS trembles making no further effort but WILSON
continues to tighten the hold red and green sparks dancing
before his eyes Then with a sigh he topples across his
fallen opponent lying together close as lovers in the
dark too spent to make another move a fine dusting of
snow settling as a blessing on their cooling bodies

CUT TO

EXT THE BOTHY NIGHT

The survivors huddle like animals in the ashes cold
seeping into their pores CARLY is still unconscious safe
in her dreams but ERIC and MELISSA are too uncomfortable to
sleep Instead they sit staring into the dark lost in
their own thoughts like strangers on a bus

ERIC
We’1ll have to go soon

MELISSA
Are you cold

ERIC nods Glancing at his watch he tries to make out the
sweep hand in the blackness It is as if time has stopped

MELISSA (CONT’D)
So am I

ERIC
Let’s go then

MELISSA reaches into her waistcoat retrieving her battered
hipflask only to find it nearly empty

MELISSA
In amo’

ERIC
If we wait any longer well be
just as dead as he is

The wind lulls the snow going from horizontal to diagonal
in less than thirty seconds Taking a measured sip from
the flask MELISSA offers the remainder to ERIC but he
declines

MELISSA
Go in a minute When the storm
blows itself out

ERIC
I think we should go now We’re
in a bad way

MELISSA stoppers the flask saving back the last mouthful

MELISSA
Okay Let’s do it then

CUT TO

EXT FROZEN LOCH NIGHT

It is a good four hours before day break and freezing
darkness fills the valley like a bowl Somewhere deep
within the gloom two tiny figures slowly pick their way
through the formless void dragging an aircraft door behind
them eyes turned upwards an invisible horizon and a dawn
that scarcely promises to come

ERIC
You should come and visit You
and your friend

MELISSA
Id like that To see Paris
Properly I mean

MELISSA strains against the improvised harness swinging
her arms to keeps the circulation going striding as
broadly as she can in the snow The rope chafes against
her aching shoulders yet she accepts the burden with
equanimity besides the weight isn’t so bad with ERIC to
share the load

The first part of the journey around the shore of the loch
is relatively easy going over good snow and although she
often stumbles and falls MELISSA is grateful for the
tenderness of that snow and its reluctance to injure

The exercise warms her and she feels her spirits rising as
the storm abates Then a great rent appears in the leaden
clouds and she gets her first clear view of the stars

MELISSA (CONT’D)
God

ERIC staggers to a halt beside her

MELISSA (CONT’D)
It’s so quiet Can you hear it

ERIC shivers The sudden silence and the proximity of
those stars seems to reassure MELISSA whilst unnerving him
making him feel smaller and less capable than before

ERIC
Know any songs

MELISSA
Only songs about death

She shoulders the harness and ERIC mechanically falls in
beside her managing a kind of swaying rhythmic walk

ERIC
Sing one for me

MELISSA
Not now

ERIC
Later then

CUT TO

EXT BEN MOHR NIGHT

A sough of freezing wind comes whirling down off the
glacier blowing spindrift about them as ERIC and MELISSA
drag the aircraft door across a jagged fan of moraine
making for a col in the south face

MELISSA is desperately tired her arms and legs operating
without conscious instruction propelling her body forward
along a groove in the screes pausing only to change the
rope from one shoulder to another a ritual she has to
repeat with gruelling regularity

MELISSA
I’m getting old

ERIC
It’s okay You’re doing good

She stops to catch her breath hearing something moving
further down the slope but it is only the trickle of stones
displaced by their passage

MELISSA
I feel like an old old woman

They wordlessly follow the groove until the groove gives
out and unmitigated scree rises ahead with soul-destroying
lip after lip appearing in slow succession

They are literally crawling now the spindrift coming at
eye level The angle of ascent is greater than sixty
degrees and such is the paucity of MELISSA’s strength that
she clings claw stiff for minutes at a time to any spur
that offers more than minimal protection from sliding
backwards

MELISSA
It’s no good We’1ll have to
rest

CARLY

Are we still alive

MELISSA bends over the makeshift stretcher touching
CARLY’s hair

MELISSA
We’re almost home We’re doing
good

CARLY

I was dreaming of you

ERIC crouches a little further up the slope trying to
activate his mobile

MELISSA
Think you can get a signal

ERIC
Maybe if I get a bit higher You
stay with the sled

CARLY
I’m cold

ERIC turns away clutching the mobile like a talisman

MELISSA
Don’t forget to come back

ERIC
Hey we’ll always have Paris

She follows his progress as he shins his way up the scree
until his outline is lost amidst the lightless jumble of
boulders

CARLY
Where’s he going

MELISSA
Across the road for some Gaulois
and the Sunday papers

She settles herself beside the stretcher trying to shield
CARLY from the worst of the spindrift using her own body
as a windbreak

CARLY
Tell him to pick up a pint of
milk while he’s at it

CUT TO

EXT SOUTH COL NIGHT

ERIC is able to move faster now unencumbered by the
stretcher muscles warming as he hauls himself up onto a
granite spur overlooking the valley For the first time he
senses a noticeable change in the quality of the light as
if somewhere on the far side of the mountains dawn is
already under way

Perching cross legged on the lip of the spur he bows his
head to the roaring void muttering a prayer beneath his
breath before trying the mobile

To his surprise his prayers are answered

EXT TERMINAL MORAINE NIGHT

CARLY curls a little closer to MELISSA watching as the
older woman takes a bearing on her compass The stars have
almost disappeared the black vault of the firmament
softening into a deep impenetrable grey

CARLY
How long How long before it
gets light

MELISSA
Soon I promise I mean it’s
getting brighter isn’t it

But light has a peculiar quality this high up

The sky has strange tones more and intense and more subtle
than at lower altitudes and MELISSA is quietly exasperated
by the number of shades of grey it has already gone
through

CARLY
That’s beautiful

For a moment MELISSA thinks she means the sky but then she
realizes CARLY is admiring the inlay on Nidge’s compass

CARLY (CONT’D)
Is that mother of pearl

MELISSA
Yeah

CARLY
Must have been someone special

MELISSA
He was

She turns away replacing the compass in her waistcoat
The wind is rising again the valley vanishing ina
freezing mist

CARLY
I’m sorry

MELISSA
Don’t be In the end it was
easy Dying is the easy part
Anyone can die

She raises her hood against the storm the wind resuming
its familiar howl bringing the snow with it as if it had
never been away The eye of the storm seems to have passed
right over them total white out conditions prevailing
again within seconds

MELISSA (CONT’D)
Staying alive That’s another
thing

CUT TO

EXT SOUTH COL DAWN

ERIC huddles in a cleft in the rocks too terrified to
move eyes turned towards the curious paleness that fills
the heavens

There are no stars now only an opaque milky lightness
Only the wind blowing fiercely in the pearly-white glow
No sun no sky no mountain no valley nothing but fine
icy particles whirling in a crazy thickness blowing in
every direction

ERIC closes himself into a knot sinking back into his
small cold space thoughts whirling in his head All
through the early hours they had followed the stars It
had been clear and now this It is surreal A swirling
vortex of snow that threatens to pull them in and under

They have survived the night passage only to be snowed in
at dawn

He thinks he hears a stealthy footfall pulling in his arms
and legs as much as he can trying not to even breathe

For a while he closes his eyes the cold permeating him

It is all there is and all he can think about

When he opens his eyes again he sees something utterly
inexplicable

A luminous butterfly is hanging in midair only a few feet
from his face its translucent wings glowing in the
refracted sunlight

ERIC shivers catching his breath

A bank of cloud crosses the sun and the light shifts
revealing the butterfly to be the glass eyeplate of a pair
of snow goggles the visibility improving just long enough
for ERIC to make out the details of the figure standing in
front of him an ice axe clenched in its gloved hands

LORCUS is wearing Donal’s ballaclava and Wilson’s night
viewing goggles dangle from his throat the all white parka
that made him invisible a moment ago encrusted with a thick
layer of gleaming frost

Realizing his hunter still hasn’t seen him ERIC cowers back
into the cleft Then he starts to tremble finding to his
dismay he can no longer control his mouth and teeth

For a moment LORCUS walks right past him only to stop in
his tracks sniffing the air as if somehow sensing ERIC’s
living presence

Bowing his head ERIC sinks his teeth into the fleshy part
of his own hand biting down to stop the chattering
Closing his eyes he tries very hard not to exist

LORCUS sniffs the air one last time and turns away
starting down the trail and ERIC exhales slowly

Just then the cell ‘phone rings in his breast pocket

A cheesy electronic rendition of ‘Scotland the Brave’
ERIC fumbles to switch off the handset but by the time he
retrieves it from his parka he is already dead the tip of
LORCUS’ ice axe passing cleanly through his brain

seem raw and rough the pores filled with oily grime the
nails broken and the skin an unpleasant shade of fishbelly
white She rubs them against her arms until she can feel
her fingers begin to flex

MELISSA
Shall we go

CARLY
What do you want to do

She offers CARLY the last mouthful from the hipflask
watching as she swallows

CARLY
I can’t walk

MELISSA
It’s okay I’11 carry you for a
while

CARLY
And then

MELISSA stoppers the flask considering her options
Bowling the flask overarm into the void she watches it fall
away from her glinting in the sourceless half-light
MELISSA
Then I’1l carry you again for a
while

CUT TO

EXT BEN MOHR SOUTH COL DAWN

Arching her back to take CARLY’s weight MELISSA forces her
way upward

In her ruined condition progress is minimal but to simply
keep going incrementally gaining altitude is all her body
and mind can encompass her limbs going through the motions
of some built in ritual that keeps them moving long after
the pilot has taken her hands from the joystick

MELISSA
He used to work here in the
summertimes He was a climbing
instructor like Wilson

CARLY
And you came here to be with him

CARLY wallows in a stupor quite comfortable in her way
clinging to MELISSA’s heaving shoulders

MELISSA
We both knew the score I mean
MS is congenital We just
thought it’d take longer That
wed have a few more years

CARLY
Sucks

MELISSA
Happens so quickly Like getting
old One minute you’re strong
and the nextfinished But so
quickly

She hitches CARLY up to stop her slipping wishing she
didn’t feel responsible for her

CARLY
So you thought you’d save me
instead

MELISSA

I hated seeing him that way It
was all I could do to take the
pain away but morphine’s good
for that

CARLY
Morphine rocks

MELISSA
Sort of a midwife I mean they
have midwives to bring you into
the world so why not to help you
leave it

CARLY
I think they call it palliative
care

MELISSA tries to summon her resolve from the pit of her
stomach but she’s too tired to recapture it for more than a
moment or two She doesn’t feel angry any more

CARLY (CONT’D)
You still got any

CARLY stares up at the mountain looming over them the
slope growing ever sheerer the rock face taking on the
scarred and barren look of the high country where nothing
grows and no animal lives for long

MELISSA
What

CARLY
Morphine You still got any

All around them are endless pits and crags horny scales of
rock angles and edges that slash at the soles of MELISSA’s
boots and skin her legs reducing the lower part of her
trousers to bloody shreds

MELISSA (CONT’D)
We have

CARLY
Yeah

The wind lulls an eerie silence falling over the
snowscape The sky is so close they can almost touch it
but there is still no trace of the sun

MELISSA
Enough But right now we still
have a chance

CARLY
I know

Then the snow turns to rain and in an instant the whole
landscape becomes fluid the rain falling with such
violence and completeness that for a moment neither of them
can really comprehend it

MELISSA

The rock wall trembles as water cascades past and down and
around and beneath them the air filling with a tumultuous
stinging spray

MELISSA lashes about herself clinging at arm’s length to
the only cracks she can find eyes tight shut her boots
skidding and sliding as CARLY’s weight pulls her backwards
the rain drawing the strength from her limbs

Her feet make contact with a ledge and she lowers her
burden pressing CARLY to the rock wall and trying to cover
her

MELISSA

CARLY
We have to find shelter

CARLY points upwards her head bent against the violence of
the storm Open mouthed MELISSA nods and they set out not
bothering to waste further energy on attempts to talk

CUT TO

EXT OVERHANG DAWN

A hundred metres further along the ledge MELISSA finds what
they’re looking for A dry space large enough to
accommodate both of them

She turns helping CARLY into the fissure before ducking
under the muddy cascade and huddling beside her too
exhausted to think or speakthe cold permeating her body
Worst of all is the horrible clammy embrace of her wet
jumper and the juddering shivers it induces

Strange woofing noises puff out of MELISSA every time she
tries to breathe and with each onset of shaking she emits a
curious low-pitched moan that she does nothing to produce
and seems powerless to arrest In fact it strikes her as a
rather funny sound and after a while they both begin to
giggle

I think it’s easing off

CARLY lies back the contents of a sandwich between MELISSA
and the rock suspended between amusement and suffering
taking a long view of their predicament She watches as
MELISSA produces the pill dispenser from her waistcoat
squeezing another three tablets into the palm of her hand
and dry swallowing them

MELISSA
Come on sun

She turns to face the curtain of rain to see if it is
really getting brighter but the sheer effort of sitting up
coupled with the sight of the falling gurgling water fills
her with an intense desire to urinate

MELISSA (CONT’D)
Christ

In her panic MELISSA tries to rise knocks her head against
the overhang and vomits onto CARLY’s legs Then a ruinous
spasm shakes her and she falls still

When she opens her eyes she finds CARLY looking at her

MELISSA
Sorry about that

MELISSA brushes vaguely at the mess which difficult to
distinguish from the general sogginess seems far less than
it felt

CARLY
Doesn’t matter

MELISSA
Pissed my pants

CARLY
Not wet enough already

CARLY takes MELISSA’s hand massaging her blackened
fingertips

MELISSA
Do I smell

CARLY
I don’t know baby I can’t
smell a thing

MELISSA
I must smell I must smell
awful I peed myself

She stares dazedly at her claw like fingers before placing
her other hand over CARLY’s

CARLY
I shouldn’t worry

MELISSA
I feel like I’m a hundred years
old

CARLY

You don’t look a day older than
ninety-nine

She tries to straighten MELISSA’s matted hair wiping some
of the grime from her lips

MELISSA
I’m sorry

CARLY
Me too

Bending a little closer CARLY lightly kisses her on the
mouth

MELISSA
Dont be

CARLY
You really wanted to rescue me
didn’t you

MELISSA looks away striving with all her strength to stop
CARLY hearing her dry tearless sobs

CARLY
Didn’t you

For a moment she thinks MELISSA is laughing CARLY doesn’t
understand what’s so funny but she doesn’t let it bother
her

CARLY (CONTD)
Hey I’m happy for it to be this
way To be with you I mean
You know that

MELISSA
Let’s go then

She starts towards the front of the fissure half convinced
she saw something out there A shadow outlined in the
curling mist

MELISSA (CONT’D)
Go out and meet the fucker

She manages to get herself upright relieved to find the
rain has stopped after all

CUT TO

EXT BEN MOHR SOUTH FACE DAY

The sun drives away the clouds casting long shadows in the
snow deep blue indentations in the mountains below

The colours seem piercingly clear to CARLY as she stares up
at the ice cliff that rises above them The sun warms her
its rays glowing the deepest purest vermilion It seems
to suffuse everything flowing over their ruined bodies in
waves washing them in radiance

MELISSA
Carly

She tightens the nylon rope about them CARLY’s weight
riding easier now her shoulders have lost all feeling
Besides the American girl is so slender so much lighter
than her

CARLY
Yeah

She has such tiny hands

MELISSA
I’m happy to be with you too

MELISSA lashes out at the wall of ice with her right fist
punching through the crust wincing at the resistance it
meets The ice is thick and hard much firmer than the day
before firm enough to carry both of them she prays

The ascent is slippery and MELISSA has to be careful
keeping her stomach close in and her butt tucked under to
compensate for CARLY’s weight

Slamming the toe of her boot through the crust she repeats
the procedure Kick and hold Smash with her fist and
hang on

MELISSA (CONT’D)
Hang on

She creeps towards the first outcrop Another foothold
another handhold and she makes it It has taken five moves
and MELISSA’s hands are numb but they are alive

MELISSA (CONT’D)
We’re doing okay

CARLY
I’m not worried

When MELISSA can move her fingers again she starts out for
the next ledge Halfway there a gust of cold wind blows up
under her sodden jumper and she glances down to see LORCUS
standing less than a hundred feet below them

MELISSA freezes unable to go up or down The snow crust
under her hand begins to give way and suddenly her body
feels unbelievably weak

MELISSA
He’s watching us

CARLY
Nice to know someone cares

CARLY finds a handhold on the cliff face taking some of
their weight helping MELISSA stabilize

MELISSA
Why doesn’t he just come for us
Get it over with

CARLY
He will When he’s ready

MELISSA pulls herself up onto the next clump of rock
panting for breath and holding on hard until the pain of
exertion begins to ebb until she can breathe again
Looking down she sees LORCUS raise his right hand wiggling
his fingers in a hello wave just as he did when sinking the
wreck

CARLY (CONT’D)
Right now he needs us

CARLY starts to wave back but then another cloud plunges
them into whiteout

MELISSA
Well fuck him I’ve had it with
men needing shit from me

She searches for another handhold moving cautiously from
rock to rock The reflection of the sunlight off the snow
warms MELISSA’s body save for her hands and feet that serve
as ice picks

MELISSA (CONT’D)
One day

The sun is full out the sky a perfect blue

CARLY
What

There is a long silence broken only by the sound of
MELISSA’s tortured breathing Then they both hear it at
once The rhythmic beat of an approaching helicopter

MELISSA
Oh God

MELISSA hauls herself towards the summit the throb of
rotors quickening like a pulse in her ears

CARLY
Cmon We’ve got to hurry

CARLY glances back knowing LORCUS is behind them but the
hooded figure has merged with the landscape once more
seeming to be everywhere and nowhere all at once

CARLY
Please God

MELISSA begins to chant under her breath using the last of
her strength letting the vibration build inside her as she
hurtles from foothold to foothold moving so fast it is as
if they are falling upwards

MELISSA
Om mani

CARLY
Please

CUT TO

EXT SUMMIT DAY

Suddenly the sheer face is no longer so steep The slope
levels out into a broad saddle and MELISSA falls face first
into the snow realizing they have finally reached the very
highest part of the mountain

MELISSA
Padme

CARLY
Come on

Lungs burning MELISSA forces herself upright taking a half
step forward and staring down at the panorama of snow
capped peaks that rolls away before then

CARLY (CONT’D)
Fuck

MELISSA
Hum Hri

More mountains Mountains and ravines as far as CARLY can
see

CARLY
Hey

A gleaming rescue helicopter is just making its second pass
across the north face gliding forward and then dancing
back as it completes its box of search

CARLY (CONT’D)
HEY

The mantra becomes an incoherent animal cry as MELISSA
propels herself down the north flank towards the circling
chopper their yells drowned out by the thrumming engines

CARLY (CONT’D)
No

To her horror the helicopter abruptly changes direction
banking sharply away from them

CARLY (CONT’D)
This is stupid

MELISSA flounders another hundred yards through knee deep
snow before her legs give out

CARLY (CONTD)
This is so fucking stupid

MELISSA disentangles herself rolling on her back in the
snow

MELISSA
I can see the bones of my finger
tips

CARLY

Look the other way

CARLY sits up brushing the snow from her hair watching
helplessly as the helicopter moves into the distance
snouting about and setting up a new pattern of search

MELISSA
Tastes salty

The wind begins to pick up the sound of rotors fading

CARLY
Talk

MELISSA
What about

CARLY
Youre the brainy one

MELISSA nods towards the line of grey metal pylons
marching away across the piste

MELISSA
It’s all down hill from here

CUT TO

EXT PISTE DAY

Down has a rhythm of its own bad for discipline because
the sloping ground causes MELISSA’s body to lurch and lose
cadence breaking her concentration The temptation is to
let her feet find their own way a sure way of breaking an
ankle in this slush To hold back and descend deliberately
is hard work

She tries to put as much weight on her heels as she can
arching her back to support CARLY as she follows the
endless pylons knowing the real world is at the other end
of them

Out of spite out of pride she begins to count the pylons
as she passes When she’s in the upper twenties she loses
track and has to rest

MELISSA
That’s okay I can dig pylons

She notices the glow first on the sleeve of her parka a
ripple of yellow light a glowing sparkling widening band
that shimmers about her as she moves her hands

She watches it fascinated noticing an outer band of
colour this one magenta growing about her arms and by
waving them like wands she can cast beautiful ribbons of
light in the air

CARLY
What are you doing

MELISSA
Can you see that The colours

CARLY
What colours

MELISSA
I dunno I think I’m going
blind

MELISSA has heard of snow blindness and wonders if this is
what is happening if the reflection of the sun on the snow
has finally caused irreversible damage to her optic nerve
As soon as she becomes anxious the colours vanish

CARLY
Try to rest for a while We can
go on later

CUT TO

EXT PISTE DAY

The bottom of the piste is proving to be much farther away
than it seemed from above At least two hours have passed
and there is still no sign of the ski station

MELISSA
Hell be coming again soon
I just wish he’d get it done
with

CARLY
He will

It’s extraordinary how you get used to the cold MELISSA
tells herself just like you get used to the sickness and
the pain They fall on you from the sky and in the end you
don’t even notice

MELISSA
It gets so you lose interest

CARLY
Just try to stay awake That’s
all that matters now

There are straight lines beneath the snow and CARLY
realizes they are walking on the bare beginnings of a road

MELISSA
Gathered on the beach
CARLY
What
MELISSA
Sorry I must be fucking losing
it

There is a low tremor like the rumble of an approaching
engine

CARLY
You said something about a beach

MELISSA
Gathered on the beach of the
tumid river TS Eliot
A level English lit

They come to a bend in the road and looking over the edge
of the embankment CARLY finds herself staring at the ski
station proper a snow plow moving on the trail below
gouging its way through the silent gorge

CARLY
Better put me down now

MELISSA
It’s about death

She relinquishes the burden gently lowering CARLY to the
side of the road unable to comprehend that the journey is
really over

CARLY
It doesn’t matter Tell me
anyway Tell me what you

remember

MELISSA
Is it like this in death’s other
kingdom

There is a stealthy footfall a sound of crunching snow

MELISSA
Waking alone at the hour when we
are trembling with tenderness

MELISSA feels a tug on the nylon rope about her waist and
she turns to see LORCUS standing beside CARLY the ice axe
cradled in his hands

MELISSA (CONT’D)
Lips that would kiss form prayers
to broken stone

MELISSA’s maimed hand falls to her belt fumbling for the
butt of the service pistol but it is nowhere to be found
Then she notices the gun is already in CARLY’s hands

CARLY
It’s what you wanted isn’t it
To rescue me

LORCUS pulls off his mask and goggles shaking out a mane
of blonde hair as he helps CARLY to her feet
They look pretty good together

CARLY (CONT’D)
It’s okay It’s gonna be okay
now

LORCUS
You knew I’d never leave you
here baby Not like this
Alone in this fucking
wasteland

LORCUS glances nervously upwards hearing the throb of
circling helicopters

MELISSA
Hey love’s the only thing that
matters isn’t it In the end

LORCUS gathers CARLY closer bending to kiss her on the
lips keeping one eye on MELISSA all the while the nylon
rope threaded through the carabiners on her belt wrapped
tight around his right hand acting as a kind of leash

MELISSA (CONT’D)
Figured you guys were an item
when I saw the photograph The
air marshal’s jacket was a nice
touch but it didn’t convince

LORCUS
But you risked your life for us
anyway How come

MELISSA
How long have you guys been
together

CARLY
Four years

LORCUS
Four crazy fucking years

CARLY
You know they would’ve killed us
if they’d taken us back They’d
have given us gas

The shining carapace of the helicopter appears above the
ridge circling lazily in the thin cold air

MELISSA
So now you’re going to kill me
instead

LORCUS
It’s not that we aren’t
grateful

CARLY
Yeah Don’t get us wrong

She turns Nidge’s compass in her hand for the last time

LORCUS
Youd do the same If you knew
it was the only way to save your
soul

CARLY
It won’t be bad baby- I promise

MELISSA
I’m not worried

CARLY
You’re the best

MELISSA
Better keep this for me

She tosses CARLY the compass and the American girl reaches
to catch it taking the gun off MELISSA for a vital split
second all the time she needs to launch herself backwards
down the incline dragging LORCUS with her the rope
entangled about his wrist the two of them rolling together
into the path of the oncoming snow plow

CARLY
NO

MELISSA tries to get up but LORCUS is already upon her the
blade of the skean d’hu ripping into the shoulder of her
jacket the air filling with flying down

Then the nylon cord is caught up by the plow blades
wrapping about the axle like a length of thread on a spool
yanking them backwards and sending the knife spinning from
LORCUS’ hands

At the last moment the driver realizes what is happening
and switches off the blades pulling the plow to a halt
Winding down the side window the perplexed individual at
the wheel stares in confusion at the two figures struggling
in the slush

DRIVER
What the hell is going on

LORCUS dives to retrieve the skean d’hu as MELISSA pulls
herself up onto the snow plow’s footplate

MELISSA
OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR

CUT TO

INTEXT SNOWPLOW DAY

The driver does as he’s told recoiling at the sight of
MELISSA’s matted hair and blood caked grime encrusted
hands

DRIVER
WHAT IS THIS

Just then LORCUS appears outside the windscreen having
climbed over the plow’s blade housing MELISSA screams as
he draws back the ice axe and the DRIVER pulls open the far
door diving in panic from the vehicle

The windscreen implodes the ice axe whistling past
MELISSA’s head to embed itself in the back of the seat

MELISSA tries to follow the driver but LORCUS’s hand snakes
out grabbing her by her jumper and wrenching her towards
him her ruined fingers flailing across the dashboard
accidentally turning on the hazard lights

CUT TO

EXT PISTE DAY

The helicopter banks circling lower as it catches sight of
the running driver floundering through the snow starting
back down the trail towards the ski-station

CUT TO

INTEXT SNOWPLOW DAY

MELISSA hits the dashboard again sounding the snow plow’s
klaxon as LORCUS tightens his grip on her throat Then the
blades whirl into life and the plow lurches forward down
the track

LORCUS lets go of MELISSA so he can disentangle himself and
she lurches backward undoing the belt to prevent herself
being hauled after him

LORCUS tries to slice the rope with Wilson’s skean d’hu but
it’s useless The frozen nylon might as well be a steel
cable

MELISSA
Fuck you lover

LORCUS
Whore

The rope snaps tight and he lashes out catching hold of
MELISSA’s matted tresses with his trailing hand

MELISSA
Let the fuck go of me asshole

There is a sharp crack as LORCUS’ right leg is dislocated
from the hip and MELISSA bellows as her head is slammed
hard against the dashboard She hears something metallic
clatter off the bonnet catching a fleeting glimpse of the
fallen skean d’hu out of the corner of her eye

Gritting her teeth she pulls herself forward LORCUS’
entire weight dragging on her greasy auburn hair Then her
hand closes on the hilt of the skean d’hu and bringing it
up she begins to hack at her own tresses For a moment
LORCUS maintains his grip and then MELISSA pulls free
crashing back into a sitting position against the control
panel

MELISSA (CONT’D)
Om mani

She closes her eyes wincing at the sound of LORCUS’ body
falling into the teeth of the snow plow his cries cut
short as the jet of slush spewing from the vehicles pump
turns from white to pink to red to pink and finally back to
white again

MELISSA (CONT’D)
Padme

She breathes a sigh of relief reaching slowly up with her
gnarled left hand to shut down the plow

MELISSA (CONT’D)
Hum Hri

CUT TO

INTEXT PISTE DAY

From above the red patch in the snow tells the whole story
the helicopter circling lower as it tries to find a place
to land the rotors whipping up the spin drift the whole
earth seeming to buck and tilt beneath the shadow of its
blades

CARLY makes it to the bottom of the embankment dragging
herself an inch at a time across the frozen soil long dark
hair fluttering in the down-draft She hears the sound of
feet crunching over snow behind her and closing her eyes
instinctively raises the service pistol to her forehead

Then the tip of a boot strikes her wrist definitively
spoiling her aim

MELISSA
Dying’s too easy bitch

She turns to see MELISSA standing over her like a divine
messenger She looks different with short hair Older
somehow

CARLY
Just let me go

MELISSA
No You’re staying here

CARLY whimpers making another little lunge for the gun and
MELISSA kicks her in the face rearranging that perfect
bridgework She rolls onto her back and MELISSA steps down
hard on her wrist pinning her to the slush

CARLY
Please

MELISSA
You’re staying here with me

Hopeless tears well in CARLY’s eyes and for the first time
she looks genuinely lost MELISSA kneels beside her
stroking her hair with her claw like hands CARLY tries to
cringe away but there is no strength left in her body and
instead she gives in to the embrace hanging on to MELISSA
as the chopper touches down behind them disgorging a unit
of armed policemen Drawing their guns the uniformed
newcomers keep their distance for a moment staring at the
two ragged shivering half-human figures as if not sure
which of them to arrest first

MELISSA (VOICE OVER)
Those who have crossed with
direct eyes into death’s other
kingdom think of us if at all
not as lost violent souls but
only as the hollow men

Radio static and gruff male voices come from all sides and
gathering CARLY in her arms MELISSA tries in vain to warm
and comfort her like the sister she’s never known the
child she’1ll never have

MELISSA (VOCONT’D)
The stuffed men

FADE TO WHITE
