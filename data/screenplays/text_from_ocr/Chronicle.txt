street in a downtrodden suburb of Portland Oregon Andrew
carries the camera loosely at his side before getting into
the passenger side of a car

In the drivers seat is MATT Garrety 17 with messy hair

Andrew films the flyer for a moment brightly colored and
featuring a picture of a smiling Steve Kazinsky before
something yanks the camera away

For the first time we see ANDREW Detmer 17 pale awkward
and gangly with long stringy hair and thin scraggly beard
He looks anxious if not afraid

BRYCE (0S)

lowering the camera

EXT HAVEN HILLS FARM - EDGE OF THE WOODS

Andrews out alone in a field now furiously cleaning the
lens of the camera obstructing our view Cut to a few
moments later the camera now resting in his lap or on the
ground We can see the barn the party still going on

After a few moments we can faintly hear Andrew crying
STEVE (0S)
(loud sudden)

ANDREW (0S)

(startled)

ANDREW (0S)
Oh I dont- Hm I dont know-

The camera goes down for a moment while Andrew futzes with
it The light clicks on illuminating Steve

STEVE
Awesome
CUT

Theyve reached the woods and Steve is climbing over the
remains of a fence The light bounces around wildly

ANDREW (0S)
What were you guys doing out here

Theyre in the woods now thick and dizzying Its near
silent but their feet crushing the Fall leaves on the ground
Steve walks out ahead

STEVE
Andrew Detmer thats right I

STEVE
Yeah video footage of me luring
you into the woods for gay sex-

MATT (0S)
Down here

ANDREW (0S)
Matt

The camera turns to reveal Matt standing next to some kind
of craggy hole in the ground at the base of a hill in the
woods Its big but the darkness beyond is impenetrable to
the camera It looks like a big black spot

STEVE
There we go There it is

CUT

Andrew and Steve are now down with Matt by the hole Andrew
is keeping the camera fixed squarely on the murky blackness
nervous

STEVE (VO)
Where is everybody

MATT

MATT
Yeah Did you tell Andrew

STEVE
Oh Andrew its making a sound-

MATT

ANDREW (0S)
Guys-

STEVE
Youve got to get really close to

Andrew takes a tentative step towards the hole

ANDREW (0S)
Guys just dont like- dont push
me or do anything like that-

STEVE (0S)
Youve got to go closer Like
almost inside it

Theres a beat

MATT
Were not going to push you we

Another pause Andrew moves towards the hole Even with
Nightvision its completely dark in there A beat

STEVE (0S)
Do you hear it

ANDREW (0S)
Its like whispering

STEVE (0S)
Listen

ANDREW (0S)
Singing

MATT (0S) STEVE (0S)

Ooooh shiiiiit—- That is so fucking creepy
Andrew turns the camera back to Matt and Steve

ANDREW (0S) (CONTD)

STEVE

MATT

ANDREW (0S)
I dont know probablyI mean

Matt looks to Steve

STEVE

Do you guys wanna go in and have a
look or what-

ANDREW (0S)
No I dont- I mean I wont do th-

STEVE
Hold your nose

Steve suddenly goes right into the hole vanishing into the
darkness

ANDREW (0S)

Hey wait-—
STEVE (FROM THE DARK)
(faintly)
Come on
MATT

Steve come on we dont know if
its stable in there- Its probably
just the wind we should-

Andrew abruptly goes into the cave

MATT (0S) (CONTD)
Andrew hey come on
Dontshit

INT THE HOLE

Its almost pitch black but we can hear Andrew breathing
Its claustrophobic in here Eerily quiet The camera
searches around but the walls are tight in here and low

ANDREW (0S)
Hello-

STEVE ANDREW (0S)
(suddenly appearing) Aah
Im right here

ANDREW (0S) (CONTD)
Does it go down much deeper or-
STEVE
Yeah really far Its not a cave
its like a tunnel- do you hear how
loud thats getting

ANDREW (0S)
Do you think it could be like wind
or-

STEVE
Come on man Come on

ANDREW (0S)
Then what do you think it is

STEVE
Huh I dunno I dont believe in
ghosts

ANDREW (0S)
Who said anything about ghosts

Steve laughs and turns going back into the darkness
Andrew follows

CUT
Matts face is suddenly in front of the camera

MATT
-shouldnt have come in here

ANDREW (0S)
Steves up ahead-

MATT
At first I thought this was a
solutional cave but nowI dunno
its like a lava tube or
something

ANDREW (0S)
I dont know what youre talking
about

MATT
Look at the walls Look at how
smooth they are Its just
straight shot down I mean we
mustve already gone forty or fifty
feet-

ANDREW (0S)
Dont talk about it youre making
me nervous

MATT
You ever hear of Platos allegory
of the cave

ANDREW (0S)
No

MATT
Nevermind

CUT

Walking Darkness The cave is even tighter now The light
flickers some kind of electrical disturbance then goes out
completely We hear Andrew curse fumbling with it and the
nightvision mode comes on

CUT

The nightvision is scrambling badly All the forms are
distorted and then-

STEVE (0S)
Can you believe this this is NUTS-

The nightvision is turned off revealing Matt Theyve come
into a larger chamber in the cave one somehow lit from
within the boys are bathed in a softly pulsing turquoise
glow

They speak loudly clearly talking over something we cant
hear

MATT
Is that is that showing up on the
camera

ANDREW (0S)
I dont wanna film it its messing
with the camera-

Matt forcibly turns the camera to reveal Steve standing next
to some kind of massive crystalline rock structure growing
from or maybe embedded in the wall Around it and him
float wispy little clouds of light turquoise and beautiful
Steve is clearly entranced sweeping his hands through the
light
STEVE
Touch one

We see Matt now also surrounded by the little aurora
borealis like clouds touch one it comes apart in a silent
little explosion of light beautiful

ANDREW (0S)
Guys maybemaybe we shouldnt

A light cloud passes in front of Andrew and we sees his hand
to extend to touch it The subsequent little light burst
badly warps the camera clearly permanent damage

CUT

Andrew is now very near to the crystalline structure viewed
up close its almost arachnid organic somehow The light
clouds have turned yellow Matt is practically inside the
structure pressing it with his palms

MATT
-changes color see It must be
reacting to the heat some kind of
exothermic reaction-

ANDREW (0S)
WHAT I cant hear you over the-

you know-

STEVE
Make it change again This is
awesome

Matt presses with his palms Theres a low sustained hiss as
the light clouds turn an angry shade of red A stream of
them is released from beneath the structure The camera
jerks suddenly revealing Steve whos clutching his ears

STEVE (CONTD)
AGHHHHH

Blood has begun to rapidly pour out of his eyes ears mouth
and nose and he buckles forwards the camera spins wildly
and we see Matt seemingly FLUNG out of the crystalline
structure
It pulses and seems to rapidly blossom and spread apart
revealing a blinding light within which EXPLODES OUTWARD we
can suddenly hear an OVERWHELMING CHOIR OF VOICES and the
camera sent rocketing backwards flipping backwards up the
tunnel-
CRACK DIGITAL
CODE

BLACK SCREEN
HOLD ON BLACK

FROM ANDREWS SECOND CAMERA

EXT MATTS BACKYARD - AFTERNOON

The camera turns on from the quality of the picture its
immediately evident that this is a newer better camera
Its on a tripod and Matt stands across a well manicured
backyard his hair is a little different time has passed

MATT
Ready

ANDREW (0S)
Rolling yeah

MATT
Okay ball test Take one

A baseball comes flying in from behind the camera nailing
Matt in the face he drops like a rock

MATT (CONTD)

OW FUCK WHAT THE FUCK STEVE
UNDERHAND

Steve comes in from off camera to help Matt laughing we can
hear Andrew laughing behind the camera too

STEVE
Im sorry oh shit Im sorry-

CUT
Now its Steve who stands on the yard

STEVE (CONTD)
Go
A baseball comes in from off camera slower It comes down
towards Steve but at the last second makes a bizarre
impossible course correction FLIES UP AND HITS STEVE IN THE
FACE
STEVE (CONTD)

AGH HEY MATT NOT COOL
Matt rushes on doing a victory lap one hand holding an ice-
pack to his face Again we hear Andrew laughing

MATT
WE ARRREEE THE CHAAAMPIONS-

CUT

Andrews out across the yard He looks a little better hes
gotten rid of the ridiculous nerd beard and his hair is a
little better kept He nods

In flies the baseball It abruptly stops in the air a foot
and a half from Andrews face Steve and Matt let out a
cheer and the camera is yanked off the tripod taken to show
a closer view of the impossibly suspended baseball and
Andrew

Andrew smiles and points to the suspended ball A trickle
of blood comes out of his nose
ANDREW
Ah shit
CUT

The cameras on a tripod up on the back porch filming
Andrew Steve and Matt standing a triangle They are playing
catchno hands The ball simply flies from guy to guy
They drop it a few times in some cuts but shout
encouragement and are clearly having a good time

Finally they get the ball going EXTREMELY fast Matt looks
up

MATT
Is-

Matt gets nailed in the balls and drops as Steve and Andrew
rush to him laughing

STEVE
“In the- penis- the penis-—
MATT
I thought I heard my dadUGHHH
WHY ME AGAAAAIN

INT MATTS KITCHEN

Steve is very intently using his newfound powers to make a
peanut butter and jelly sandwich knife shakily moving over
bread The camera is set down on the counter Matt and
Andrew watching

ANDREW
The trick is to pretend like its
on a plate You get it on the
plate and then you wrap the plate
around it and you can move it
however you want

STEVE
Mhm

MATT
Ive been pretending I was like
holding it in a fist like a
floating hand

ANDREW
Yeah Plates easier for me

STEVE
Guys check it out

Steve has a glob of jelly and a glob of peanut butter
floating freely They slap together and then down onto the
bread which slaps closed

STEVE (CONTD)
Ha
(notices his bloody nose)

takes the kitchen knife and presses the tip into the flesh
of his wrist He drags the blade down hard all the way to

himself several timesbut no penetration

wrecked car as Andrew fidgets to get it mounted The area is
lit by lights from the main building not too far away but

Andrew moves out in front of the camera He telekinetically
pulls an old car forward and lifts it easily He moves it
left moves it right rolls it sets it back down

CUT

Andrew is sitting resting tired He speaks directly to the
camera

ANDREW

Ive been doing a lot of reading
like you know online about
evolution and the way it works
and you know natural selection
The uh

(cut)
The strongest animals will always
survive and theyre the ones that
you know will prosper or grow
and survive by feeding on the
smaller animals And as humans we-
see theresuh-

(cut)
Theres this thing called an Apex
Predator and basically what that
is the most powerful predator in an
ecosystem And humans you know
were the apex predator because
theres nothing that preys on us
cause of weapons and stuff But if
something could I bet it would
I

(cut)
I mean what Im trying to say is
a lion doesnt feel guilty when it
kills a gazelle You dont feel
guilty when you squash a fly you
know- I think that means
something I think it really means
something

CUT
Andrews back out with the car He lifts it again then
makes a quick squeezing motion As he does this the car
violently compresses down to the size of a basketball
Andrew flings the ball of metal into a scrap pile which
collapses loudly
Andrew falls down onto his butt a little exhausted but as
he gets up he is abruptly attacked by a guard dog which
bites him twice before hes able to fling it off

The dog recovers and rushes Andrew who raises a hand
blasting the dog across the yard killing it instantly

Andrew turns and looks at the camera and it turns off

INT DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREWS ROOM - LATER

Andrew is filming out his window watching his father leave
His stereo plays David Bowie Once his dads car is gone
Andrew sets down the camera on the dresser opposite the
mirror and leaves the room

Time passes and Andrew reappears now dragging a crate He
opens it and pulls out his fathers firemans uniform We
do short-space time cuts as he takes out the jacket looks at
it and turns it inside out so that the metallic fireproof
inner lining is exposed

Ziggy Stardust comes on Andrews stereo

Andrew wearing the jacket looks at himself in the mirror
his back to the camera He reaches down and picks something
up looking at it then pulls it over his head

Its a gas mask

He stands there staring at the surreal hard edged faceless
figure in the mirror Looks right Looks left Adjusts the
mask

Then turns and whips out his hand the camera is abruptly
yanked across the room

EXT RUN-DOWN HOUSE - SUNSET

Its a run-down house in Andrews neighborhood The
streetlights and the setting sun give everything light in
yellow orange haze

Howard Costly and some other thugs are chilling on the
porch laughing loudly smoking a blunt They clearly
havent noticed Andrew whos filming from out by the street

He reaches down and picks up a rock then hurls it at the
house It flies up and breaks a window Costly Howard and
the thugs immediately mobilize swearing and posturing as
they rapidly surround Andrew

He doesnt react

HOWARD
You are about to get fucking
stomped you know that right You
hear me son Come to my house
its late I dont see any fucking
police officers or some shit I
dont know what you you think
youre doing throwing shit at my
house-

COSTLY
No wait what the fuck What the
fuck are you dressed up like that

HOWARD
Lil Andrews straight up tripping

give your ass a wake up call-

Howard starts towards Andrew who raises a hand out in front
of the camera He makes the gun sign

HOWARD (CONTD)
Oh you got a gat I got a gat too
bitch-

Howard starts to pull a gun from the back of his pants

ANDREW (0S)
(firing the finger gun)
Bang

Howards body abruptly FOLDS BACKWARDS with a sickly loud
chorus of cracks and then is FLUNG ASIDE The thugs
shocked dont have a second to react before Andrew
telekinetically BLOWS ONE OF THEM BACKWARDS sending him
smashing headfirst through the windshield of his car

Costly and the remaining thug start running and the
remaining thugs legs suddenly flip up out from under him
breaking bending and twisting like a rag doll before hes
propelled face first into the ground WHAM

Andrew launches into the air coming down just in front of
Costly who skids to a halt

COSTLY
-no no-

Costly is shoved to the street and ground back and forth as
though under the weight of a giant thumb leaving a
glistening smear of clothes blood and skin before he falls
across the curb

We can hear the men screaming and groaning in agony but
other than that the night is silent

Andrew raises a hand and all of their wallets and loose

money lift away from them flying to him Theres a beat
and then Andrew launches into the air

EXT RADIOTOWER - 80 FEET UP - TWILIGHT
Andrew sits under one of the red airplane spotter lights on
one of the strut supports The camera sits nearby watching
the expressionless figure as it counts the money

Theres a beat and he hangs his head We can hear muffled
noises of frustration from under the mask Something that
sounds like a low angry scream

Very suddenly he dives off the tower A second later the
camera is yanked after him zooming out into freefall

EXT GAS STATION

Andrew holding the camera touches down just outside the gas
station He waits a beat and then starts to walk towards
it We transition to

FROM GAS STATION SECURITY CAMERAS
Black and white a slightly grainy feed with no audio

We watch from the camera by the pumps as the bizarre figure
in the coat and the gas mask holding the camera out in front
of it strides past people pumping gas into the station
store

INT GAS STATION

The wall mounted security camera shows us the whole store
Andrew enters turning to the clerk behind the register who
says something looking concerned Hes suddenly blown out
of frame

After a beat the register rips itself free from the counter
and floats over to Andrew

Andrew turns and walks out the register floating with him
as he does a second clerk rushes out panicked yelling He
goes behind the counter and grabs a shotgun

EXT GAS STATION

Andrew exits the gas station as does the clerk who yells
raising the shotgun

Andrew whips an arm out towards him and the clerk fires as
hes hit by a wave of energy The shotgun blast goes wild
striking the stacked tanks of propane next to the garage
The effect is instantaneous a blinding white flash of fire
envelopes the clerk and floors Andrew the camera we look
through jerking awkwardly the feed breaking down

FROM ANDREWS SECOND CAMERA

The camera lays awkwardly on its side the distorted audio
from its damaged microphone SUDDEN AND PIERCING

Its been flung a good deal away from Andrew who lays
motionless burning

The clerk is dead and a nearby gas station customer is
horribly injured and screaming His gas pump lays on the
ground pumping out gas onto the asphalt

Andrew slowly shifts unable to move properly and forces
himself to roll over The fire on his body touches the fire
on the asphalt and spreads lightning fast to the gas pump

The resulting explosion engulfs the entire station
The camera is spun violently out into the street-
VIOLENT

DISTORTION AND
CRASH TO BLACK

FROM SECURE ROOM VIDEO FEED

INT HOSPITAL ROOM

The camera is color with crackly strange somewhat
distorted audio The image is a little blown out

Andrew on a bed His entire right side is absolutely
scorched the flesh looks like bloody cracked paper
blackened and red The parts of him that are bandaged are
already soaked through with blood

He is barely breathing hooked up to various machines
Andrew is not going anywhere anytime soon This is ensured
by the handcuff on his left wrist

The machines beep Andrew doesnt move The door opens and
Mr Detmer enters speaking to a POLICE DETECTIVE on the
other side of the door

MR DETMER
-come down to the city cause his
mothers all alone right now
Shes got MS I had to leave her at
the house all a fucking alone

POLICE DETECTIVE
I understand Mr Detmer

MR DETMER
Shit Jesus look at this Can I
have a moment with my son

POLICE DETECTIVE
Yeah I- Ill be outside the door
yeah

MR DETMER
Okay

The officer closes the door and Mr Detmer goes and sits
down in a chair next to the bed He sits there staring at
Andrew clearly horrified and upset and buries his head in
his hands We SPEED UP THE RECORDING and Detmer just sits
like that After five minutes of speed up we slow down

MR DETMER (CONTD)
I want you to apologize to me

Andrew is comatose

MR DETMER (CONTD)
I said I want you to apologize to
me I know you can hear me So I
want you to sit up and apologize to
me I want you to stop this
bullshit right now

Andrew is comatose

MR DETMER (CONTD)
Do you know how much this shit is
going to cost me Do you know what
youve done to your family
(beat)

You dont even care do you You
just dont give a fuck youve got
your fucking morphine dont you
Theres a beat and then Detmer suddenly slaps Andrews burnt
shoulder Andrew flinches badly and his pulse speeds up on
the monitor
MR DETMER (CONTD)
Stop it Im not buying this shit
you cant just play this off like a
fucking
(slap)
Game this is real You really
fucked me me and your mother you
know that you little
(slap)
Shit
Andrew no longer flinches but the slaps leave red bleeding
molten welts Detmer stands up clearly upset and takes a
quick pace forward and back

MR DETMER (CONTD)
Goddamn it goddamn it-

Detmer goes to slap Andrew again and Andrews arm jerks up
Mr Detmer floats is telekinetically lifted into the air

He hangs screaming and struggling for a moment then becomes
rigid

Andrew spreads his fingers and his father abruptly separates
into all of his component parts

They stop moving hanging lifeless then drop to the ground
in a bloody mess

Andrews eyes open revealing black-red eightball
hemorrhages and he seizes badly letting out a scream of
agony and then another tearing at his IV

The police detectives rush the room reacting with horror to
the gore that was Andrews father They barely have time to
scream out when Andrew snaps his cuff free of the bed and
lets out AN ENORMOUS CONCUSSIVE BLAST blowing apart
everything in the room including the camera

to a stop hanging at about two hundred feet Caseys
breathing is painfully short and sharp Matt stares out into
the night sky

He flicks on the brights Theres Andrew in his hospital
gown floating a dozen feet out his flesh charred and
twisted his body clearly wracked with agonizing pain

A news helicopter circles past out of sight and for a
moment Andrew is framed in the choppers spotlight

His eyes flash to the car

ANDREW
(screaming)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
The windshield is TORN OUT and seconds later MATT IS RIPPED
OUT OF THE CAR AS THOUGH YANKED BY A GIANT HOOK taking his
seatbelt with him
CASEY

No NO NO

The car goes into freefall no longer important to Andrew
plummeting down down down Caseys screams are barely
audible over the rushing of the wind as the buildings rush
past outside her camera frozen in place as she plummets to
her death

And then suddenly so suddenly its completely disorienting
the side of the car bursts apart and were flying blurred
views of buildings the sky the side of some jeans

Stillness Caseys camera is pointed down showing her
adidasand Matts high-tops

NOTE In the following sequence everything is seen in
glimpses and glances never lingering too long on one thing
Much of what happens should be seen through implication
rather than direct effect

Everything happens very fast and none of the cameras can
fully keep track

FROM SEVERAL HELICAMS

The feed is crisp and clear but without the satellite audio
meaning no narration from the reporter There are several
choppers flying at different distances from the action and
we intercut as necessary

EXT DOWNTOWN PORTLAND

The news chopper at first shows Caseys destroyed car laying
in the street then pans back up to show Andrew whos
floating hunched over vomiting

Matt flies up behind him and tries to help him but Andrew
shoves him away Were too far away to hear anything thats
said

Matt tries again and Andrew yells something Matt clearly
upset replies Andrew talking fast and jerky gestures
towards his burns Matt tries to reply several times but
Andrew isnt hearing it Matt smiles nervously at the
destruction and says something gently

Andrew replies and whatever is said here it causes a
radical shift in Matts demeanor Hes no longer concerned
he seems repulsed Andrew says more clearly SCREAMING at
Matt

Matt seems to beg Andrew for something and Andrew relents
Matt continues more forcefully and then notices something

to his right A BUS SMASHES HIM OUT OF THE AIR SWATTING HIM
LIKE A BUG INTO THE SIDE OF AN APARTMENT COMPLEX

Andrew suddenly turns flailing an arm at us in the chopper
a mailbox comes CRASHING UP INTO THE CAMERA

FROM MICHAEL ERNESTOS CAMERA

MICHAEL ERNESTO is along with several other people from his
building out on his roof He watches in horror as the
helicopter Andrew hit goes out of control falling out of
frame

Moments later we hear the explosion as it crashes

MICHAEL ERNESTO (0S)
Oh oh no those people man those
people oh god-

ERNESTOS NEIGHBOR (0S)
Wheres the other guy

MICHAEL ERNESTO (0S)
Hes fucking dead man you saw- oh

Andrew comes toppling down out of the sky like a wounded
bird crashing into the roof He vomits again mostly bile
everyone around him is in shock frozen as he screams in
pain and rolls over

Hes bleeding badly from the nose and ears

ANDREW
(agonized crying)
No ones gonna help meNo ones
gonna help me now

We get some shots from other peoples cameras video phones
etc on the roof Some people scream and try to run past
Andrew and he blasts them off the roof like bowling pins
which leads to more screaming

Andrew stands shakily looking directly at Michael Ernesto
MICHAEL ERNESTO (0S)
Please man please I dont know

you man-

ANDREW
(mumbled)
What type of camera is that

MICHAEL ERNESTO (0S)
(breaking down)

Andrew starts to raise an arm when hes suddenly NAILED BY
MATT blasting by at well over eighty miles an hour

FROM BANK SECURITY CAMERA

The inside of the bank is quiet and peaceful when MATT AND
ANDREW COME CRASHING THROUGH THE ROOF

FROM POLICE CAR DASHBOARD CAM

The police car rockets up the street but has to screech to a
halt when MATT AND ANDREW COME EXPLODING OUT OF THE FRONT OF
THE BANK

The two of them brawl in the street for a moment its not
impressive martial arts or even super powered just two guys
fighting for their lives Matt gets the upperhand decking
Andrew and driving him to the ground and suddenly the cop
car (our POV) lifts off

WE GO FLYING INTO MATT crashing out the camera as he turns
and creates a telekinetic wall

FROM CALA PRENTIS CAMERA

CALA filming from her apartment window watches in shock and
horror as the police car carried by its momentum is sent
FLIPPING INTO THE AIR and we glimpse it as it passes her
window lights still flaring

Her sister rushes up looking out the window

CALA (0S)
Sissy stay away from the window

sIssy

Andrew and Matt come BLASTING UP THROUGH THE FLOOR IN THE
KITCHEN OFF TO THE RIGHT AND THEN OUT THROUGH THE CEILING

FROM KPR-PORTLANDS HELICAM

The two boys come smashing up through the roof of the
apartment building Andrew flies low and Matt gives chase
Andrew turns beginning to telekinetically lob everything at
street level at Matt traffic lights parking meters trees
etc
But Matts too good a flyer What he doesnt block he
simply dips and weaves around Andrew clearly still woozy
is distracted and smashes into a street-light wiping out on
the asphalt
CAMERA-MAN
Theyre down One of them just
went down Jesus christ

Matt slowly lands nearby The camera zooms in and hits them
both with a spotlight causing Matt to shield his eyes and
look up scared as Andrew struggles to stand

We get a good look at the toll this is taking on him Matts
face is a crimson mask of blood from his nose eyes mouth
and ears Hes limping badly his clothes torn visibly
covered with injuries He looks like hes been in a car
wreck

CAMERA-MAN (CONTD)
Oh shit look at him

He approaches Andrew talking again more fervently Andrew
just shakes his head falling repeatedly as he tries to
stand like a wounded dog

Two cop cars skid to a halt nearby the officers unloading
and taking cover One of them advances on Matt and Andrew
gun raised Matt goes out in front of Andrew protective
pleading raising his hands

The cop is clearly panicked He fires a shot Matts arm
whips out impossible fast he buckles and screams in pain
holding his hand which is gushing blood

Andrew blasts the
Matt falls screaming and Andrew stands
officers backwards
CAMERA-MAN (CONTD)
OH SHIT Oh jesus christ
Andrew approaches Matt screaming and looking absolutely
terrifying Matt turns and ROCKETS OFF INTO THE SKY Andrew
following a second later tackling Matt out of the air

FROM KPR-PORTLANDS LIVE-ON-THE-SCENE

Were at street level in downtown people are absolutely
everywhere wandering out into the street baffled scared
and looking for answers A FIELD REPORTER fixes herself
preparing to speak

FIELD REPORTER

Are weOkay yeah gimme- two

Parson Boulevard just south of the

center of downtown and-
Theres a rushing screeching sound from around the corner
The camera jerks and moves towards the corner the cameraman
man running to see what the sound is

FIELD REPORTER (CONTD)
Shawn wait youre unplugged
Shawn-

Something around the corner explodes and Matt comes flying
past overhead slightly on fire before Andrew comes lunging
at Matt catching him twisting out and over the camera man
SLAMMING HIM INTO THE SIDE OF A SKYSCRAPER ON THE STREET
Andrew lifts Matt up high into the air scraping him against
buildings on either side of the street bouncing like a
pinball until-

FROM ABC 5S HELICAM

-Matt struggles and theres a visible ripple in the air a
massive concussive burst sending both of them rocketing
downwards as though shot out of a cannon

They strike the massive bronze statue of Portlandia a
trident wielding demigoddess in front of the Michael Graves
building uprooting it from its pedestal before crashing to
the ground

Matts body accordions brutally when he lands and he flops
down at a broken dead angle Andrew lands nearly as badly
lays still for a moment and then begins twitching and
screaming when the choppers spotlight hits him

FROM MICHAEL GRAVES BUILDING EXTERIOR SECURITY CAMERA
The statue of Portlandia lays awkwardly in the street
Andrew writhes Matt is motionless blood pooling around
him his back broken

FROM POLICE DASHBOARD CAMS HELICOPTER CAMERAS HANDHELDS
FROM WINDOWS EVERYTHING

A bunch of squad cars and emergency units converge around the
front of the Michael Graves building and downed statue Matt
and Andrews bodies are painted by spotlights as police and
news helicopters hang overhead

Police unload en-mass guns out immediately forming a
perimeter and pushing in Were with them as they approach
the mood is of barely controlled panic officers shouting
back and forth to each other

Andrew and Matt are polka-dotted by red-laser sight dots

Andrew suddenly stands up and several officers fire the
bullets spark off an invisible barrier in front of him and

he shakily raises both hands

The all of the police officers firemen and paramedics are
telekinetically lifted into the air

They hang struggling for a moment and then all of their
limbs go rigid Weve seen this before

Andrew screams and thenIt all happens in under two

seconds

Matt swings an arm blinding fast the triton wielding arm of
Portlandia bends jaggedly bringing down the pitchfork hard
first through Andrew then into the pavement

Andrew stands impaled a look of shock on his face and then
Matt flails up his hand the bullet lodged inside fires out
striking Andrew in the head killing him instantly

All of the floating people drop dazed

Matt collapses After a moment the police advance

CUT TO BLACK

FROM CLEAN ROOM CAMS
The clean room cams are incredibly hi-def crisp and clear
with all manner of data and time codes scrolling all over the
top and bottom of the screens

Matt lays on the floor of a perfectly white room At the far
end is a blackened out two way mirror Theres a camera on
the inside of this too and we can see resolute men in suits
reflected on the inner glass watching with unreadable
expressions

There is a chair and a table but hes clearly fallen out of
the chair Its maybe an hour after the scene in front of
the Michael Graves building and hes received no medical
attention

To this end Matt is suffering from among other things
massive blood-loss multiple broken bones dozens of gashes
and cuts presumed internal bleeding and a broken back

He can barely move sliding around on the floor in his own
blood as he dies watched by the compassionless eyes of the
cameras

He is barely coherent screeching in agony

MATT
PleaseHelp me Help me HELP ME
pleaseIm sorry Im so sorry
I tried- help me help me Im
dying Im dying Stars- I see
stars somebody- It hurts please
Im- the bloodI tried

Two men in contamination suits enter the room wielding some
kind of radiation sensors They go over to Matt scanning
him

MATT (CONTD)
Listen help me help me Im
dying you have to help me dont
just let me- PLEASE IM SORRY Im
SORRY HELP ME I-

The men ignore him as Matt makes some gasping sounds his
eyes going wide

MATT (CONTD)
I canI can hear the singing

Matt entirely stops moving He lays there not breathing
completely still
And then suddenly the two men are flung backwards as is the
table and the chair There are a series of grotesque popping
and snapping sounds from Matts body and he jerks and
writhes pushing himself up onto his hands and knees

The security cams track and zoom and as Matt stands we
realize a startling truth his cuts are closing themselves
His broken bones have already molded back into place His
bruises are shrinking away to nothing

The blacked out glass suddenly shatters and falls out of its
frame revealing a shocked frightened room of high ranking

military personnel along with several men in civilian
clothes
Matt stares at them They stare back at him

4-STAR GENERAL
(terrified)
ListenSon you dont- I mean
Matt raises a finger to his lips and the general trails off
Matt smile weakly for a moment then stops

MATT
Would you pleaseturn off the

fucking cameras

FROM KIM HAI-SUS CAMERA

INT KIM HAI-SUS HOUSE

Kim Hai-Su 17 is behind the camera filming his father 40s
as his father hurries to gather his things into a duffle
Kim Hai-Sus younger brother 8 wanders into the room
crying loudly and Kims father screams at him to put down
the camera

CUT
Theyre in the car driving fast through town All around we
can see people panicking and we see two cars collide on the
road up ahead

CUT

They pull up onto an on-ramp and are immediately trapped
into gridlocked dead-end traffic Kim Hai-Sus father
begins shrieking and banging on the dashboard which
triggers his younger brother crying again Kim shouts to
calm down

CUT

Kim is climbing out of the car people all around are getting
out of their cars hopelessly trapped Someone screams and
Kim turns to reveal an enormous dam several miles away

Rubble is falling off the side of an gigantic crack which
splits further Kim yells in fear The crack widens an
enormous tidal gush of water bursts through gushing down the
side of the hills into the valley

Kims father embraces him and they have a brief exchange
when suddenly theres the sound of a sonic boom overhead

All around them people EXPLODE into cheers Its not fear
but rather a kind of frantic ovation The camera sweeps up
panning the empty blue sky excitedly finally coming to rest
on
Matt Garrety

Looking fucking great as he floats above the freeway He
pantomimes yeah bring it on cheer louder This gets the
intended response and he pumps a fist shouting FUCK YEAH
KOREA

He turns pretending to notice the oncoming flood for the
first time mouths Oh shit Points at the flood casually
as it closes in I should deal with this Another huge
ovation and Matt smiles widely nods his head yeahhhhhh
and turns

Theres a sonic boom as he goes from zero to mach 4 in less
than a second rattling the cars on the freeway disappearing
into the distance over the flood

After a moment the impossibly huge onrush of water seems to
stop slowing and freezing in place and thenSLOWLY BEGINS
TO REWIND TOWARDS THE DAM

The camera jerks around wildly as the crowd goes insane
embracing kissing screaming jumping on their cars Kims
father has collapsed into tears of joy next to the car and
Kim himself is hooting and hollering from the bottom of his
lungs

The camera comes up to show his little brother who is going
positively ape-shit on the hood of their car jumping up and
down screaming smiling

An unearthly angelic vibrating chorus of voices starts to
rise rise singing and we-
