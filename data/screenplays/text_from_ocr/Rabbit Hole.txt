TITLE SEQUENCE

A blank white page A hand reaches into frame and draws a
box in black ink The hand continues to draw and inside the
box a suburban house starts to take form This seems to be a
panel in a comic book of some kind

EXT BACK YARD OF A BEAUTIFUL HOME - LARCHMONT NY - MORNING

Its a gorgeous spring day and we move in on an impeccably
laid out garden Straight rows of flowers in full bloom
manicured bushes and a trellis with climbing vines

BECCA CORBETT attractive 30s walks into frame dragging a
heavy bag of potting soil She pulls it over to a section of
the garden where she had been digging and cuts the bag open
Becca lifts the soil and dumps it into the small ditch

BACK TO THE COMIC BOOK BEING DRAWN

The drawing inside the panel is much further along Now we

see a father with a football on his front lawn and his son
maybe twelve with his arms raised and a speech bubble that
reads Dad Im wide open

INT PRIME BROKERAGE - RISK MANAGEMENT OFFICE - DAY

HOWIE CORBETT handsome 30s is at his desk jabbering with
a CLIENT Over his shoulder is a window with a beautiful
view of Manhattan

The client asks about the family photos on the shelf behind
Howie - several of him with Becca and their son DANNY age
4 Howie pauses for just a moment then spins around grabs
one and shows it proudly

BACK TO BECCA IN THE GARDEN - DAY

Becca is on her knees now trowel in hand planting a
straight line of summer bulbs

BACK TO THE COMIC BOOK BEING DRAWN

A mom is added to the drawing She’s got a pitcher of
lemonade and a big smile

BACK TO BECCA IN THE GARDEN - DAY

Becca is in the vegetable garden weeding a row of tomatoes
She pauses to wipe her brow and adjust her gardening gloves
Behind her under a tree we notice an empty doghouse
BACK TO THE COMIC BOOK BEING DRAWN

The final touches on the panel - suburban dad mom son
football But then we pull back and reveal theres also a
tree in the drawing And theres a boy - identical to the
son on the lawn - who peers out from behind the tree with a
big thought-bubble over his head that reads

BACK TO BECCA IN HER GARDEN - DUSK

The sun is going down and Becca stands with a hose watering
the garden She stands admiring her days work

WOMANS VOICE (0C)
Becca

Becca turns to see her neighbor PEG middle-aged sweet
peeking around the gate She comes into the garden Becca
is a little uncomfortable but always polite

crushed plant She assesses the damage and sighs peeved

Across the way she can see right into her neighbors living

carefully cauterizes the top of it into a brown hard shell

EXT GOODWILL PARKING LOT - DAY

Becca gets out of her car grabs the garbage bag of clothes

Once there she considers what shes about to do for just a
moment and then lifts the bag into the drop box She turns
on her heel and heads back to the car without looking back

INT BECCAS CAR - A MOMENT LATER

Becca pulls up to a stoplight and she takes a deep breath
determined to hold it together

A school bus pulls up beside her car and Becca glances over
at it Sitting in one of the window-seats is a teenage boy
facing front Becca stares at him curiously And then the

grip on her steering wheel tightens

The boy turns his head slightly and for just a second Becca
gets a good look - its JASON WILLETTE 17

INT BUS - CONTINUOUS

Jason is hard at work sketching the comic book we saw in the

In this panel the father in a lab coat is in a science lab

Hole Behind him the boy peers in through the window The
bubble over the father’s head reads “Why do I feel as if I’m
being watched”

BACK TO BECCA —- CONTINUOUS

Becca leans forward trying to get a better view of the boy
The light changes to green and the bus takes off

Becca shaken just watches it go And then the car behind
her starts honking and Becca is snapped back to reality
She puts her foot on the gas

EXT ROADS OF LARCHMONT - DAY

The school bus rolls through the manicured streets of the
town It stops at a corner to let a couple students off
And then the bus continues on

When it does Beccas car rolls into frame keeping a safe
distance from the bus she’s trailing

EXT TREE-LINED STREET - LARCHMONT - A LITTLE LATER

The bus has stopped and Becca pulls up a ways behind it
This time its Jason who gets off book-bag slung over his
shoulder The bus pulls away and Becca watches as he heads
up the driveway of a nice house and slips inside

She sits there for awhile Then finally pulls away

INT BECCA AND HOWIE’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

INT HOWIE AND BECCAS BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Becca is alone in bed reading She lowers her book when she
hears something from downstairs Then goes to investigate

UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER

Becca sneaks out of her bedroom She hears voices and the
distinct sound of a little boy laughing She takes a
moment then steels herself and heads downstairs silently

AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

Becca peers down the long corridor that leads to the living
room where the voices are coming from There she sees
Howie with the lights off in his chair watching a video of
Danny on his phone

We see flashes of Danny on the little screen spinning around
in what seems to be a tire swing We hear a dog barking

HOWIE (on video)
Faster

DANNY (on video)
(laughing)
Yeah faster

BECCA (on video)
(laughing)
You’re gonna make him sick Howie

The video is mostly a blur with Danny’s laughing face coming
into focus for just a second The dog continues to bark

BECCA (on video)
Youre making the dog crazy

HOWIE (on video)
Taz quit it

DANNY (on video)
(laughing)
Faster

This is too hard for Becca She backs away as the video
continues and sneaks back up the stairs unnoticed

INT BECCA AND HOWIES EXERCISE ROOM - MORNING

BECCA

instead of getting defensive Howie actually smiles a little

and watches as Jason gets off the bu He adjusts his
backpack as the bus pulls away Same as last’ time

But instead of heading inside Jason walks toward Becca

BECCA

quickly puts it on

Jason meanwhile doesnt even notice her He walks right

the money and heads into a back room Jason meanwhile
heads off into another part of the library

When the coast is clear Becca approaches the front desk

A car horn suddenly blares crossing in front of them Howie
turns the steering wheel sharply Sound of screeching
brakes The car goes hydroplaning across a couple lanes of
traffic Its terrifying Cars swerve out of the way

Becca clutches the dashboard with her eyes closed

Somehow Howie gets control of the car It comes to a stop on
the shoulder Its quiet now except for the sound of a
ticking signal and the rain pounding on the windshield

HOWIE
Are you okay

Becca opens her eyes and nods She takes a deep breath
Thenshe leans over into the back seat

HOWIE
What are you doing

BECCA
What do you think I’m doing I’m
checking the cake

Normal people dont fly around in

the plane crash

BECCA
(to Howie)
You ready to go

NAT
You shouldve stopped me from going
off on that Kennedy stuff because
my point Onassis and how he put up
a reward to anyone who could prove
that someone had sabotaged his
son’s plane He was so desperate
to blame somebody Have you read
this Howie

HOWIE
(waves to Izzy)
Were gonna take off

NAT
He needed a reason for losing his
son But it didnt come of course
And it killed him The grief did
There was nothing to give him
comfort and so Re died You see

Becca and Howie gather up their coats and things
over to say goodbye but Nat keeps talking

NAT
Its like the Kennedy curse
People want things to make sense

BECCA

NAT

I wish someone had given me a

little advice when Arthur died

Becca turns on her mother and lashes out

BECCA
Youknow what I wish I wish you
would stop comparing Danny to
Arthur Danny was a four-year-old
boy who chased his dog into the
street Arthur was a thirty- year-
old heroin addict who hange
himself Frankly I resent how you
keep lumping them together

Nothing but the sound of jukebox music and falling pins

NAT
He was still my son

Becca gathers up her things Howie helps to usher her out

BECCA
We’re gonna go Izzy I hope you
enjoy the bathroom set

IZZY

Becca and Howie head out No one else moves

NAT
When Arthur died I was just as
upset as she was but I never took
it out on other people

IZZY

EXT COMMUNITY CENTER PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Howie gets out of his car and starts to walk toward the
building where Group is held Only something slows his step

At the other end of the parking lot he sees a car idling
Gabby is sitting in the driver’s seat Just sitting there
Something isn’t right Howie walks towards her concerned

As he comes around the passenger’s side and looks in the
open window everything becomes clear Gabby is firing up a
bowl She takes a huge toke and only then sees Howie

GABBY
Jesus Christ

She tosses the bowl in the ashtray Howie is really amused

HOWIE
Hey Gabby

GABBY

GABBY
He’s gotten me all upset I mean

HOWIE

Gabby chuckles Thenshe realizes he’s serious And Howie
smiles like a naughty child

INT BECCA AND HOWIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Becca sits in bed reading the Parallel Universe book her
brow furrowed Something about it really intrigues her

INT MEETING HALL -— COMMUNITY CENTER - NIGHT

The support group is well underway Howie and Gabby sit in
the circle of chairs They are both pretty stoned

GRIEVING FATHER 2
And I listen to these guys at work
and they go on and on about paving
their driveways or whatever just
the most stupid nonsense and I
think they don’t know Their lives
havent been ripped apart yet

GRIEVING MOTHER 2
They’re not in the club

GRIEVING FATHER 2
Exactly Lucky them They’re not
in the club

Howie starts to snicker quietly Gabby dare not look at him
She is biting the insides of her cheeks so as not to laugh

GRIEVING FATHER 2
And so they get to bitch about the
Mets like that means something
Meanwhile I’m sitting there like
Hey guys my daughter died of
leukemia Not that you care”

Howie chuckles jnappropriatel - A few people turn to him
He clears his throat and stands

HOWIE
I’m sorry I need some water

He gets up Gabby closes her eyes again so as not to laugh

EXT COMMUNITY CENTER PARKING LOT - END OF THE NIGHT

The meeting has let out Howie and Gabby walk out together

HOWIE
Youre one of those bad kids my
mother warned me about

GABBY
(re the pot)
Don’t worry I won’t tell Becca

HOWIE
(beat)
Id appreciate that

They part ways heading off to their respective cars Gabby
gives a little wave and gets into her car

INT LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Howie plunks down into his chair and whips out his I-Phone
still stoned He clicks through his applications looking for
something He can’t find it Howie is confused

He clicks the screen of his phone repeatedly panic starts to
set in He scrolls through Something is very wrong

INT BEDROOM STAIRWAY HALL - SIMULTANEOUS

Becca is still reading when she hears Howie yelling

HOWIE (0S)
Becca Whatd you do here

We stay on Becca as she dashes from the bedroom down the
stairs and toward the living room everything reeling

INT LIVING ROOM -—- CONTINUOUS

Howie stands in the middle of the room scrolling through his
I-Phone applications Hes beside himself Becca stands in
the doorway scared

HOWIE

She takes the phone from him and scrolls the screens trying

to find it

He grabs phone and hurls it against a wall

BECCA
Jesus Howie I didnt do it on

HOWIE

Becca stands staring at him dumbstruck

It smashes

BECCA

(no response)
You think I deleted Dannys video
on purpose

HOWIE

BECCA
You dont know

HOWIE
I shouldve copied it

BECC
Why would I deliberately delete

HOWIE

She glares shaken waiting for some kind of explanation

HOWIE
Youre trying to get rid of him
Im sorry but thats how it feels
Every gaye it s something else It
feels like youre trying to get rid
of any evidence he was ever here

BECCA
(beat - holds it together)

fridge

BECCA
Yes to save them The paintings

HOWIE
And since you never wanted the dog--

BECCA

Howie’s been reduced to tears He has to move away from her
Becca takes him in She seems more confused than affronted

BECCA
Do you really not know how
impossible that would be To erase
him

(MORE)

BECCA (contd)
No matter how many things I box up
do you really think I dont see him
every second of every day

Howie looks up at her

BECCA
That video was an accident And

prevented but didnt

HOWIE
Thats not what I want Bec

BECCA a

HOWIE

BECCA

HOWIE

She just stands there unable to respond

HOWIE

Howie heads for the door then stops

HOWIE

They regard each other silently Howie heads down the hall
and then up the stairs leaving Becca alone

INT LIBRARY — DAY

Jason is in a secluded corner working on his comic book

In one panel we see the boy passing through the portal in the
science lab And in the next panel we see him falling
through a rabbit hole in space The boy looks terrified

Jason looks up at the clock Crap he’s late He gathers up
his stuff and runs

EXT PARK — DAY

Jason sits eating a lemon square Becca is beside him
There’s a tin of lemon squares between them

JASON
You really made these

BECCA
I did

JASON
Theyre good Still warm

BECCA
Im glad you like them

Theyre still pretty formal with each other

BECCA
So Ive been reading that book
The parallel universe book

JASON
Yeah

BECCA
I don’t really buy it The whole
alternate reality thing

JASON
You don’t

BECCA
No Too weird Was it fora
school project

JASON
No Its research

BECCA
Oh Research

He considers her then reaches for his backpack He unzips
it and pulls out a handful of papers held together by a big
binder clip He hands the pages to her

Becca looks down at what is obviously the hand-drawn comic
book weve seen The cover is very retro and Flash Gordon-
esque Becca reads the title - “Rabbit Hole”

JASON
Its a comic book

She flips through the pages - more incredible pen and ink
drawings a strange space portal science fiction action
sequences a pirate sequence dinosaurs

BECCA
Whats it about

JASON
A scientist I guess And his son
The father discovers this network
of holes to other galaxies and um--

BECCA
Parallel universes

JASON
Yeah but the scientist dies So
the son goes into the rabbit holes
trying to find him Well not him
because hes dead but another
version of him

Becca is looking down at one panel of the comic book it’s
one we saw earlier the father and son playing ball on the
front lawn the mother with lemonade and the boy behind the
tree with the “” thought bubble over his head

JASON
I know its kinda stupid but

BECCA
Not at all Id love to read it

JASON
(gets uncomfortable)
Oh Well its actually um not
finished yet So

BECCA
(beat)
Okay Thats fine

He reaches out and politely takes it back from her then
returns it to his backpack

JASON
You can read it when I finish

He takes another bite of his lemon square Becca feels
badly

BECCA
Look I dont want this to be
uncomfortable for you If you
dont want to meet thats totally
fine It just felt like--

JASON
(interrupts her)
I mightve been going too fast
at)

(be
That day
Silence Becca doesnt know what to say

JASON
Im not sure but I might’ve been
Sothats something Ive been
wanting to tell you

She just sits there and listens Jasons confession is
simple and quiet Theres nothing overwrought about it

JASON
Its a thirty zone And I mightve
been going thirty-three Or thirty-
two I would usually look down to
check and if I was a little over
then Id slow down obviously But
I don t remember checking on your
block so its possible I was going
a little too fast And then t
dog came out really quick so I
swerved a little to avoid him not
knowing obviously

Becca looks away She doesn’t want to embarrass herself

JASON
I thought you should know I
mightve been going a little over
the limit I cant be positive
either way though

Silence Becca feels many things But mostly she feels
badly for him Jason takes another bite of his lemon square

INT GABBYS CAR - COMMUNITY CENTER PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Gabby and Howie are sitting getting stoned again They smoke
up in silence for several beats before anyone speaks

HOWIE
I really dont wanna go in there

Gabby looks to him What are they gonna do instead

INT ARCADE - NIGHT

Gabby and Howie are at adjacent lanes playing skee-ball
Theyre having a great time Gabby bowls an impossible shot

HOWIE
Oh come on

GABBY

She laughs They continue to play over the following

Howie continues to bowl not really sure how to respond

GABBY

all the things we were doing to
destroy each other

HOWIE
Jesus Im sorry

GABBY
No itsthis is generally how it
goes right Youve read the
statistics It changes you It
literally changes people Part of
me thinks it was inevitable

The arcade is noisy The air is suddenly charged and full of
meaning It feels dangerous And this scares Howie They
skee-ball in silence for awhile Then

HOWIE
I love my wife

GABBY
(pause)
Of course you do

HOWIE
I love her very much

GABBY
Okay

HOWIE
This cant turn into anything

They just stare at each other for a moment Then Gabby
smiles and goes back to the game Howie is shaken he
too goes back to the game

INT LIVING ROOM - HOWIE AND BECCAS HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

Becca is on the couch reading the Parallel Universe book
when she hears Howie come in the front door She immediately
tucks the book behind a couch cushion and grabs a magazine

INT FOYER - CONTINUOUS

Howie hangs his keys by the door Then seeing the living
room light on he feels a pang of guilt

INT LIVING ROOM -—- CONTINUOUS

Howie stands in the archway for a couple beats before Becca
looks up at him

HOWIE
So I think youre right We should
maybe look into selling the house
ts probably for the best

Becca barely responds Why the sudden change in opinion

BECCA
Okay

She watches as Howie turns and heads upstairs

INT BECCAS KITCHEN - DAY

Becca pulls a warm pie out of the oven It looks perfect
Suddenly we hear a dog barking Becca startled nearly drops
the pie She sighs annoyed and moves it to the counter

Through a window we see Taz in the yard zipping along a dog-
runner barking happily

HOWIE (0C)
The ol apple pie trick eh

Becca turns to see that Howie has entered the kitchen

BECCA
What

HOWIE
For the Open House Warm baked
goods makes it feel homier I
thought you were doing it for the
Open House

BECCA
Oh No I was just making a pie

Howie shrugs - wrong again Becca tidies up

HOWIE

BECCA
God no You shouldnt either

HOWIE
Come on Im not gonna bother
anyone Itll be fine

INT FOYER - LATER THAT MORNING

Howie is chatting with the slightly uptight middle-aged
REALTOR woman Beccas getting ready to go

HOWIE
So I thought we’d set the sign-in
sheet here and they could move
into the living room

REALTOR
Thats fine

HOWIE
My wifes gonna go hide out but
11 stick around if thats okay

The realtor pauses slightly barely masking her displeasure

REALTOR
Sure However you want to do it

Becca suppresses a smile

EXT PARK —- A LITTLE LATER

Becca sits reading the parallel universe book on the same
bench she sat with Jason She didnt make plans with him
but half-hopes she might see him here She puts down the
book and looks around

There are parents minding their kids on the jungle gym
Theres a couple sitting on the grass sharing a newspaper
A group of guys play touch-football Only Becca is b
hersel and she feels it maybe harder than she ever has

She takes out her Blackberry clicks on Address Book and
begins scrolling through names of friends Who to call
Name after name passes by with Becca occasionally pausing

She Finally stops on the name Debbie and stares at the
number e really considers calling her But then thinks
better of it and moves further down the list of names

INT IZZYS BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Izzy toothbrush in hand has just finished a phone call
She hangs up her cell phone Auggie pops his head in

AUGGIE
Who was that

IZZY
Becca She wants to “hang out”

Auggie looks as confused as Izzy She grabs one of her new
hand towels (from Beccas bathroom set) and wipes her mouth
The newly decorated bathroom looks fantastic

INT UPSCALE NAIL SALON - DAY

Izzy and Becca sit side by side getting pedicures Becca
flips through a magazine The PEDICURISTS work in silence

IZZY

BECCA
Youre starting to show a little

IZZY
I know I feel gynormous

BECCA
While Mom looks after the baby

Becca smiles and goes back to her magazine Izzy cant quite
tell if shes just been insulted

BECCA
While youre at the gym Mom can
watch the baby She loves that

IZZY
Auggie can watch the baby

BECCA
Okay Auggie then

tongue but is losing the battle

BECCA
Izzy--

The pedicurists exchange a look

It’s not Izzy’s intention but this wounds Becca

Silence

IZZY

BECCA
Nobodys comparing us

IZZY

BECCA
Honestly Izzy I dont know what

erson who can raise a child and
ook after it and protect it

IZZY
I resent the feeling I get from you
that I dont deserve the baby Or
that Im not mature enough or
smart enough or something to take
care of it I mean my god if Mom

BECCA
beat)
Youd be surprised

They stare at each other

IZZY
I just wanna feel like you have a
little faith in me because Im up

BECCA
Great I hope you are

Becca goes back to reading Izzy shrugs why bother

INT HOWIE AND BECCAS KITCHEN - DAY

Howie stands expectantly with a clipboard as a SUBURBAN
HUSBAND and WIFE with a four year old SON come in from the
back yard with the realtor The tour is going very well

WIFE
The layout is exactly what weve
been looking for

HUSBAND

(to his wife)
And the light in here

WIFE
I know its beautiful

This is much harder than Howie anticipated A bit of panic
seems to kick in

REALTOR
Why don’t we take a look upstairs

HOWIE
I can show ‘em up You guys wanna
follow me

He takes over leading them upstairs The realtor is miffed

INT DANNYS ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Howie is leading the family past the doorway

HOWILE

if you want to see--

But the wife stops and ducks into Danny’s room

WIFE
What’s in here

HOWIE
Oh that’s uh--

The family has entered the room Howie follows them in

HOWIE
This could be a room for the little
guy obviously

HUSBAND
How about that buddy You like
this room

The boy makes a b-line for one of Dannys wind-up robots
Howie is immediately on edge

HOWIE
Oo careful with that

WIFE
Thats not yours honey

The boy reluctantly puts the toy down

HUSBAND
How olds your son
(off Howie s blank look)
This is your sons room I assume

HOWIE

They look confused This is suddenly very awkward

HOWIE

WIFE
Oh my god

HUSBAND

WIFE

HOWIE
Yeah its pretty weird I still
forget hes not here sometimes
Like maybe hes pest hiding ¥ under
the bed or something and he
gonna pop out That’s what he used
to do

This comes out weirder than Howie intends The parents are a
little creeped out The little boy looks to the bed scared

SMASH CUT TO FOYER - A MOMENT LATER

The family makes a quick exit hurrying by the realtor as
politely as they can

WIFE
Thanks so much

And theyre gone The realtor glares at Howie as he comes
strolling down the stairs oblivious

REALTOR
Please don’t do that again

Howie plays dumb shrugs “What I say”

INT SUPERMARKET - DAY

Becca and Izzy stroll along with the shopping cart Muzak

BECCA
You don’t mind this
IZZY
Nope
BECCA

I just need to grab a couple
things and then we’1ll do lunch

Becca makes her way past walls of sugared kids’ cereals with
colorful boxes She rolls past not daring to look at them

They turn a corner and Izzy stiffens She’s spotted someone
over by the deli counter She looks to Becca who hasn’t
noticed

IZZY
I’m gonna wander

But Becca is too busy reading the ingredients on a can of
soup to notice Izzy slip away

INT DELI SECTION - A MOMENT LATER

Becca’s friend DEBBIE is picking up some Lunchables for the
kids when Izzy approaches

IZZY
Debbie

Debbie turns and smiles a bit obviously not recognizing her

IZZY
It’s Izzy Becca’s sister

And Debbie goes a little pale

DEBBIE
Izzy hi How are you

IZZY

DEBBIE

IZZY

DEBBIE
(beat - confused)

Debbie doesn’t know how to respond she’s so taken aback

IZZY
I’m just kidding

DEBBIE
(a nervous little laugh)
Oh

IZZY
She’s here though if you wanna end
the stand-off Aisle six I think
Debbie looks around Now she’s really on edge
DEBBI

IZZY

She glares at Debbie who can barely look at her
IZZY
You know accidents aren’t
contagious right

Izzy actually manages to make Debbie feel even worse than she
already did

INT ANOTHER AISLE - A MOMENT LATER

Izzy comes up behind Becca and pops something in the cart
Becca eyes it suspicious

IZZY
Pimento loaf I had a craving

Becca ooged out by it makes a face Izzy looks like
something’s wrong

BECCA
What’s the matter

IZZY
(beat)
Nothing I just got a little wave
of morning sickness Or whatever
Not morning obviously but

BECCA
You okay

IZZY
Yeah

rzZy smiles When Becca moves on izzy glances back and sees
Debbie’s abandoned shopping cart She’s obviously fled

ANOTHER AISLE - A MOMENT LATER

Becca turns the cart into the next aisle She peruses the
baking supplies Down the far end of the aisle she spots a
MOTHER shopping with her RED-HAIRED BOY in the cart Hes
about five and really not happy

RED-HATRED BOY
But I want them I want them

MOTHER
I wish I could help you

RED-HAIRED BOY
Theyre strawberry I want them

The mother very deliberately turns her back on the boy and
scans the shelf in front of her ignoring him entirely which
only angers him more

RED-HAIRED BOY
Pleeeeease I want them bad
no response)
Froooooot roll-ups I said Please

Becca tries to not pay attention but it gets under her skin

The boys whines turn into wails and still the mom does
nothing It goes on for several beats until Becca can’t
take it anymore She is suddenly striding down the aisle
toward them Surprised Izzy hurries after her

IZZY
Becca

But its too late Becca is already talking to the mom

BECCA
You know what Its only three
bucks why dont you just get him
the fucking roll-ups

The boy stops whining He and Izzy look to the mother to see
her response The woman’s eyes narrow

MOTHER
Not that its any of your business
but we dont allow candy in our
house and my son knows that

BECCA
Come on theyre made with fruit
Why not give him a treat

MOTHER
Its not about giving him a treat
or not its the principle Are
you a mom

The question hangs out there Izzy lowers her eyes Becca
is obviously caught off-guard She struggles to respond

BECCA
No No I’m not a mom

MOTHER
I didn’t think so
(moves her cart)
Excuse me

Becca suddenly reaches up and smacks her across the face
Hard The woman stares at her shocked Becca and Izzy look
equally shocked Did that really just happen

Then the boy suddenly bursts into tears

IZZY
Go to the car Becca

She doesnt move Izzy hisses through gritted teeth

IZZY
I said go to the car

Becca slightly dazed steps away from them Everything
around her swirls a bit Faces come in and out of focus as
she breaks into a run and dashes for the exit

INT BECCAS CAR - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

Izzy is loading the groceries into the back Becca sits in
the drivers seat still shaken Izzy slams the back closed
and gets in the car

BECCA
Is she going to press charges

IZZY
No I explained it all

Becca looks to her

BECCA
She was ignoring him

IZZY
I know And if you ever see me

doing that to my kid you can slap
me too

Becca can’t help smiling She starts the car

INT BECCA AND HOWIES KITCHEN - END OF THE DAY

Howie is looking over the sign-in sheet Taz is barking out
in the yard Becca and Izzy come in with the grocery bags

Becca unpacks the groceries over the following

HOWIE
So Fun day out

Becca tosses Izzy a warning glance

BECCA
Howd it go here

HOWIE

that room

BECCA
(pause)
Okay

HOWIE
I thought we could turn it into a
guest room or something
to I12z
Dont get any ideas

IZZY
Ha-ha-ha

Then Izzys smiles disappears She looks scared Becca
notices and turns around - whats wrong Howie turns too
And then we see

Jason is standing in the doorway of the kitchen Hes
somehow walked in unnoticed

IZZY
Jesus

JASON
Hello HiumThe door was wide

And I knocked but

They all stand there still taken aback by the moment Taz

Beccastands motionless Theres no way out of this She
finally reaches out and takes the book

HOWIE

Jason looks to Becca then makes a quick exit

Theyre all silent for a couple beats

BECCA
(quietly)
Youre an asshole

She goes out after Jason Howie watches her go Izzy puts
groceries away

EXT DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

Becca catches up to Jason

BECCA
Wait a minute

Jason turns clearly thrown by the encounter

BECCA

glances over at the Open House sign

JASON
You didnt mention you were moving

BECCA
(beat)
Yeah

You want this back

JASON

No I want to know what you think
of it

A moment between them He turns and hurries down the block
away from her She watches him go

INT BECCA AND HOWIE’s KITCHEN - THAT NIGHT

Becca is rolling out a pie crust when Howie enters in his
robe and slippers He watches her in silence for a moment

HOWIE
Why didnt you tell me

BECCA
The same reason you don’t tell me
why you come home reeking of pot

Howie doesnt even blink He just stands there defeated

Then he turns and shuffles back out of the kitchen She
rolls out the dough more aggressively

INT DANNYS ROOM - A COUPLE WEEKS LATER

Nat is helping Becca clean out Dannys room Becca is
putting Dannys books into a milk crate Nat is taking toys
stuffed animals puzzles etc out of a toy box and placing
them into a garbage bag or into a keep-box

Something stops Nat Shes pulled one of Dannys sneakers
out of the toy box Its smaller than she remembers Becca
glances over at her and realizes whats happening

BECCA
Dont do that
(takes the sneaker)
Quick and clean like a band-aid
Or well never get through this

Becca places the sneaker into a garbage bag passes Nat a
Kleenex and carries on as if the moment never happened

She moves to the closet and grabs acouple toys accidentally
flipping the switch to an obnoxiously loud flashing toy

BECCA
What the hell

It takes a moment but she switches off the toy

BECCA

without children give these kinds
of gifts

She pops it into the keep-box with a smile

NAT

INT FOYER STAIRWAY - LATER

Howie comes in from a game of squash
and racket

She gets a genuine sguckte out of Becca

They

Hes got his gym bag

We hear Nat jabbering away upstairs

NAT (0S)
And remember I put the chocolates
out and Danny ate the entire bowl
when no one was looking And I
thought it was so funny But then
Howie was like Those werent
candy They were chocolate-covered
espresso beans

We stay on Howie as he moves up the stairs

NAT (OS)
But Danny had eaten the whole bowl
so he was really wired And
running in circle and putting
things on his head

BECCA (OS)
He was up to three that night

At the top of the landing Howie sees that Dannys bedroom
door is open He approaches

INT DANNYS ROOM - CONTINUOUS

NAT
I didnt know what the damn things
were You get me these fancy gift
baskets with all this crazy stuff--

They turn to see Howie standing in the doorway He takes in
the room Its pretty much empt ye The bed’s been stripped
The rug is gone The walls are bare This is hard

BECCA
Hey

BECCA
Fine
HOWIE

Made quick work of it I see

BECCA
We did okay

He looks over to a couple crates of toys

BECCA
We saved a few things I thought

basement for now

HOWIE
Sounds like a plan
(pause)
Im gonna take Taz for a walk You

BECCA
I dont think so

HOWIE
Okay
(to Nat)
Thanks for helping out Nat

NAT
Sure

Howie turns and goes Becca and Nat share a look

EXT SIDEWALKS AROUND HOWIE AND BECCAS HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Howie still rattled is walking Taz on a leash The big
dumb dog is essentially pulling him down the block

HOWIE
Easy

He tugs on the leash but Taz pays no mind The dog
continues to pant and pull excited to be out of the yard
Again Howie snaps the leash hard but it hardly does
anything Howie is getting pissed

HOWIE
Stop pulling Taz

They turn a corner and a squirrel scurries over a fence
Taz leaps at the fence barking ferociously

HOWIE
I said stop it

Howie snaps the leash back way too hard and Taz lets out a
pained YELP The dog retreats from the fence and cowers
Howie immediately feels horribly and runs to him

HOWIE
Im sorryy -pUPPY Im sorry Are
you alright

He buries his face in the dogs fur He feels to make sure
hes okay Howie rubs his neck and pats his fur Taz looks
up tentative and licks Howies hand The dogs fine But
Howie feels like a complete and utter heel
INT BASEMENT -— SIMULTANEOUS

Becca and Nat carry the milk crates of Dannys stuff down to

the basement

things Becca has put aside

Becca stands there taking it in
small corner of stuff in the basement

breath then turns to her mother

The

BECCA
Does it ever go away

BECCA

This feeling

lock eyes Nat can see she actually wants an answer

Maybe for the first time ever

Theyre silent for a couple beats

NAT
No I dont think it does Not
for me it hasnt And thats goin
on eleven years

(beat)
It changes though

BECCA
How

NAT
I dont know The weight of it I
guess At some point it becomes
bearable It turns into something
you can crawl out from under and
Carry around - like a brick in your
pocket And you forget it every
once in a whi but then you reach
in for whatever reason and there it
is Oh right That Which can
be awful But not all the time
Sometimes its kinda Not that
you like it exactly but its what
you have instead of your son so
you dont ganna let go of it
either you carry it around
And it doesn t go away which is

BECCA
What

NAT
Fineactually

turns and heads up the basement steps

and put them in the corner with a few other

Becca nods a little

INT HOWIE AND BECCAS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Theyre both in bed reading Becca is engrossed in Jasons
comic book Howie glances over a bit annoyed by it

We see a panel - the boy in the story is running from an army
of armor-clad knights He passes through a portal and in
the next panel hes falling through another rabbit hole He
lands on a suburban block The thought-bubble over the boys
head reads Theres my house Im back home

We follow Becca’s eye across the panels We see the boy at
the front door of the house and the parents staring down at
him confused The bubble over the boy s head reads “Its
me Your son” And the mother’s bubble reads “But we don’t
have a son”

The next panel a close-up of the boy’s devastated face And
in the next panel he asks them “Would you like one”

Becca lets out a little gasp when she sees the picture
Howie looks over intrigued But she doesn’t explain

HOWIE
How is it

BECCA
Its good

She keeps reading Howie tries to return to his book

HOWIE
Are you gonna see him again

BECCA
Yes I think I am

Howie simmers but knows not to say anything about it

Becca stares down at the final image in the comic book the
parents embracing the happy boy

INT HOWIES OFFICE - MANHATTAN - DAY

he reaches for the phone and dials a number

INT GABBYS KITCHEN - SIMULTANEOUS

Gabby runs in from her swimming pool in a dripping wet
bathing suit She answers the phone

HOWIE
Okay Im ready

The pen is poised waiting to take down the number

INT BECCA AND HOWIES KITCHEN - END OF THE DAY

Howie is preparing Tazs dog dish for dinner He looks

the clock viously nervous and a bit freaked out He adds
a cup of ary dog food to Tazs bowl Then stops and
considers it

HOWIE
Fuck it

He adds two more heaping cups of dog food to the bowl and
heads out to the yard

EXT YARD -— CONTINUOUS

Taz is barking and jumping as Howie makes his way to the dog
house Howie places the food down and Taz attacks it

Howie turns back to the house and sees Becca working in the
garden Shes looking at him strangely

HOWIE
Hey
BECCA
Hi Youre going to group tonight

HOWIE

(tries to sound off-hand)
Yeah You

(a worried beat)
You didnt want to come did you

BECCA
No

Howie tries to not look relieved Becca looks a little
guilty as if she might have a secret as well

HOWIE
Im just gonna hop in the shower

BECCA
Okay

He gives a little wave and heads in Becca watches him go

EXT BECCA AND HOWIES DRIVEWAY - DUSK

Howie freshly showered and changed heads for his car One
guilty look over his shoulder and he gets in

INT LIVING ROOM FOYER - CONTINUOUS

Becca watches from behind a curtain as Howies car pulls
away As soon as it does she heads for the foyer grabs the
Rabbit Hole comic book and her car keys She heads for
the door

EXT BECCA AND HOWIES DRIVEWAY - A MOMENT LATER

Now Becca pulls out of the driveway and drives off in the
opposite direction

INTERCUT BETWEEN THE TWO CARS

As they drive down various suburban roads Becca and Howie
are both nervous and eager to get where theyre going

Becca places the comic book up on the dashboard
Howie checks his teeth in the rearview mirror

Becca takes out her cell phone and dials a number

EXT GABBYS HOUSE - DUSK

Howie finally reaches his destination Its a beautiful
house on a nice block He slows to a stop at the curb He
puts the car into park

He looks up at the house and takes a deep breath Hes
terrified He doesnt move He just sits in his car

INT BECCAS CAR - DUSK

She pulls up Jasons block and cant help smiling Shes
grown to enjoy these encounters with him

But as she gets closer her smile fades Shes really not
expecting to see the scene in front of her

EXT TREE-LINED STREET - OUTSIDE JASONS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Becca stops the car a safe distance away unnoticed by
anyone Theres a limo parked at the bottom of the driveway
Becca watches as Jason in a tuxedo very self-consciously
pins a corsage to a SKINNY GIRL in a prom dress

JASONS MOTHER giddy with pride takes picture after
picture JASONS BUDDY and his BUDDYS DATE heckle them from
inside the car

When its time to go Jason and his date move to squeeze in
the back seat Lots of good-natured shoving and big dresses
flipping up and laughing

Jasons mother laughing herself captures it all on film

INTERCUT WITH BECCA IN CAR

Its a relatively benign scene but Becca watches it as
someone might watch a car-wreck - stunned confused a little
disbelieving

And suddenly as the limo doors are closed and its about to
drive off something huge and uncontrollable opens up inside
of Becca and she begins to cry A lot She clutches the
steering wheel and pretty much loses it

INT LIMO - SIMULTANEOUS

Still laughing Jason turns for just a moment and sees
Beccas car as they roll by - in slo-mo Becca is
hysterical but silent behind the glass of her windows
Jasons smile disappears

And he has a memory - the only flashback in the film

EXT BECCAS FRONT LAWN - DAY - FLASHBACK

Jason at the wheel of his car terror in his eyes turns to
see Becca standing outside of her house trembling not
comprehending at all what she sees They lock eyes

Though Becca has just seen the body of Danny we never do
We only see Becca and Jason in this moment And then

BACK TO THE LIMO

Jason watches as Becca and her car disappear behind him and
he continues on to his prom

INT BECCAS CAR - A MOMENT LATER

Becca is alone now The street is empty again She finally
lets go of the steering wheel Her crying is pretty much
over And she reaches for a Kleenex But she doesnt start
the car She just sits there

INT HOWIES CAR - OUTSIDE GABBYS HOUSE - NIGHT

And Howie sits in his car as well also not moving Hes
been here for awhile the motor idling

Finally he cant bear it anymore He opens the car door

and gets out He smooths his shirt and heads up the walk-
way toward Gabbys front door It FS just a few yards but

the walk may as well be a hundred miles

About half-way Howie stops and stands there He cant take
another step From a nearby tree hangs a decrepit tire-
swing It obviously hasn’t been used in years Several
moments pass as Howie takes it in

Finally the front door opens and Gabby appears looking out
at him

GABBY
Did you find the house okay

Howie doesnt respond He doesnt even move

GABBY
Howie

Is he going to go through with this He takes a step back

GABBY
Are you okay

HOWIE
I’m uh I’m not gonna go back
to group And I just I thought
you should know that “I don’t find
it as helpful anymore

They both know this is not what he came here to do

HOWIE
(barely a whisper)
Im sorry

Howie turns and heads for the car He gets back in Gabby
watches as he starts the car and pulls away

When hes gone her shoulders drop in defeat She slips
inside and gently closes the door behind her

INT HOWIE’S CAR —- SPEEDING HOME - MOMENTS LATER

Howie is suddenly in a big hurry to get home He flies
through the suburban back roads determined and terrified of
the very big mistake he very nearly made

EXT HOWIE AND BECCA’S DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Howie pretty much jumps out of the car and runs for the front
door but something stops him He turns back In the
backseat is Danny’s car-seat He considers it Then

Howie yanks the back door open grabs the booster and tosses
it in the bags of garbage that have been put on the curb for
pick-up He closes the car door and heads into the house

INT BECCA AND HOWIES FOYER - NIGHT

Howie tosses his keys by the door and peeks into the living
room but theres no one here

INT KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER

No sign of Becca He peers out the kitchen window into the
backyard Taz is asleep in the dog house

He moves to the basement door and listens Nothing He
calls down the stairs

HOWIE
Becca

Still nothing This is odd Where did she go

INT STAIRWAY UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

He runs upstairs a bit of panic creeping in now

HOWIE
Becca

INT BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

He ducks his head in No one there

INT DANNYS ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Howie clicks on the light Of course theres no one here
either He looks around the room But theres nothing
Other than the stripped bed the room is completely empty

And slowly we see Howie’s determination drain out of his
body He’s too late Becca isn’t here And he’s convinced
she’s actually left him

Spent Howie sits on the bed staring off into space Then
he quietly takes off his shoes and lies back on the bed

INT BECCAS CAR - NIGHT

Its actually very early in the morning Becca is asleep in
her car - pretty much where we left her

There a little tap-tap-tap at her window She wakes up
disoriented and sees Jason outside still in his tuxedo

BECCA
Jesus
JASON
Sorry
BECCA
What time is it
JASON
Almost five
BECCA
And youre just getting home
JASON
(pause)

Did you wanna talk

BECCA
I should get back I cant believe
I fell asleep

JASON
Id like to talk

Becca considers it Of course shed like to talk too

EXT PARK — DAWN

Theyre back on their bench The sun is just creeping up
over the fields of the park Theyve been sitting here for
awhile now without saying anything

BECCA
So how was it

JASON
It was okay

BECCA
Well you look nice

JASON
Thank you

BECCA
Was that your girlfriend

JASON
Just a friend

BECCA
Shes pretty

Jason looks to Rabbit Hole which sits on the bench between
them

BECCA

I left you a couple messages
JASON

Sorry My mom found out I was

cutting school so

BECCA
She confiscated the phone

Becca smiles and picks up the comic book

BECCA

Well I liked it very much
JASON

Thanks
BECCA

It reminded me of Orpheus and
Eurydice Do you know that myth

JASON
Not really

Eurydice dies and Orpheus misses
her so much that he travels to
Hades to retrieve her but in the
end it doesnt work out

JASON
I should read it

Becca flips through the book Jason undoes his bow-tie

BECCA
So is the scientist your dad
(off his blank look)
The scientist the boy is looking
for is that your dad

JASON
(beat)
No

BECCA
I mean is it based on him

JASON
No My dad was an English teacher

BECCA
Oh Okay I was curious about
that part

JASON

Its just a story

BECCA
No I know I was just

JASON
Reading into it

BECCA
Yeah

They sit there A jogger runs by in silence

BECCA
Do you think theyre real

JASON
Parallel universes

BECCA
Yeah Other versions of us
leading different lives

JASON
You think it’s fake

BECCA
But what do you think

JASON
I think it’s basic science If
space is infinite then everything
is possible

She smiles a little This was the answer she was hoping for

BECCA
So somewhere out there theres a
version of me -- what -- making
pancakes

JASON
Sure

BECCA

Or at a water park

JASON
Wherever yeah Both Laws of
probability There are tons of
yous out there and tons of mes

BECCA
So this is just the sad version of
us

BECCA
But there are other versions where
everything goes our way

JASON
Assuming you believe in science

BECCA
(beat
Well thats a nice thought That
somewhere out there Im having a
good time

Jason smiles They look out over the fields and the sun
peeking through the trees

INT DANNYS ROOM - MORNING

Howie fell asleep on Dannys bed last night He wakes up
squinting at the sun coming in from the windows

We hear the clink of mugs being taken from a cabinet and
coffee being made Morning sounds It’s so strikingly
normal that Howie wonders for a moment if he isn’t imagining
it And when he realizes he isn’t a wave of relief washes
over him

INT KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Becca is at the table drinking her coffee nibbling on a
piece of pastry

Howie comes in still sieepy and takes in the scene He
gets a mug and pours himself some coffee

BECCA
I picked up some Danish if youre
interested

Howie gets a plate and cuts himself a piece Then moves to
the table They drink their coffee After a while

HOWIE
I thought maybe you had left

BECCA
(beat)
What do you mean

He can’t even say it But she sees the fear in his eyes
she feels badly for him

BECCA
No I didnt leave

Howie hides his relief by reaching for the morning paper
leafing through its contents

BECCA
So I was thinking we should invite
Rick and Debbie over for a cookout

Howie looks up at her totally perplexed

BECCA
Shes never gonna call She thinks
I hate her I might as well just
let her off the hook

HOWIE
So a cookout then

BECCA
Itll be good to see the kids We
should get something for Emily
though We missed her birthday
She turned four last week

HOWIE
Right Okay

Howie stares into his coffee mug

HOWIE
Dannys is coming up
BECCA
I know
HOWIE

Thats gonna be a tough one

BECCA
Yeah

Howie looks up at her

HOWIE
So the kid Jason Did you tell
him we didnt blame him

BECCA
We don’t blame him

and

and

HOWIE
No I know but did you let him
know that
BECCA
I guess so
HOWIE
(beat)
Thats good
BECCA
Look Howie if you want talk with
him
HOWIE

BECCA
Okay

They pick at the Danish

HOWIE
Its so quiet

BECCA
Thats because I slipped Taz a
couple Ambien

HOWIE
(smiles)
Youre funny

BECCA

A nice moment between them It’s been awhile since they’ve
had one

Becca faces him - down to business now

BECCA
So what are we gonna do

HOWIE
About what

BECCA
I dont know pick something

HOWIE
(thinks it over)
WellWe could g° to Village Joys

Emily Thats probably something
shed like

BECCA
Okay Candy Land Thats a start
Then what

HOWIE
Then we wrap it

BECCA
Uh-huh

HOWIE
And then we have the cookout

Howies voice continues over the following scenes

EXT BECCA AND HOWIES BACK YARD - A FEW WEEKS LATER - DAY

A bright day Howie is at the grill Nat is blabbing away
to him Becca is chatting with her neighbors (Peg and Pete)

Rick and Debbie come through the back gate with EMILY 4 and
ROBBIE 7 Becca gets up and welcomes them

HOWIE (VO)
And theyll come over and well
have a couple other people so its
not too awkward for anyone

Debbie is still rather sheepish and apologetic when greeting
Becca The kids make a b-line for Taz whos tied up in the
doghouse and happy to see them

HOWIE (VO)
And to make them feel comfortable
well ask a bunch of questions
about what the kids have been up
to and well pretend that were
really interested

Howies voice continues over several more shots from the day

Izzy looking especially pregnant shows up with Auggie
Shes brought some kind of pie Becca seems both shocked and
impressed by it

Despite the iconic suburban cookout this should feel more
winsome than happy The unresolved issues linger

HOWIE (VO)
And then well wait for someone to
bring up Danny while the kids are
playing And maybe thatll go on
or a little while

And as he describes we see them all sitting around having
some adult conversation as the sun goes down

SAME - THAT NIGHT

Everyones gone Howie and Becca are sitting at the table
out on their deck both looking off thinking

HOWIE (VO)
And after that theyll go home

Becca glances over at Taz who is quiet and exhausted

BECCA (VO
And then what

HOWIE (VO

(beat)

I dont know Something though
Well figure it out

BECCA (VO
Will we

HOWIE (VO
I think so I think we will

Becca looks to Howie They both look a bit scared

She reaches across the table and takes his hand for the
first time in a very long time

Its a simple gesture - not of resolution - but of
possibility Howie holds on tight

And we

FADE OUT

THE END
