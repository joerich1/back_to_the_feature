A Hard Days Night

they

pile

to

EXTERIOR STREETS OUTSIDE RAILWAY TERMINAL DAY

The film opens with crowds of girls shot in a sequence of CLOSE-UPS
chasing after GEORGE JOHN and RINGO The boys hare off just ahead of
them They take a turn down a back alley way and the crowds of
screaming girls are after them

EXT TERMINAL

They rush on through the narrow cobbled passageway and into the main
station quickly show their tickets at the barrier for the London
train and get onto the platform as hordes of yelling and screaming

girls reach the closed gates

EXT TERMINAL PLATFORM

We see the fans rushing to the few platform ticket machines and
endless pennies being dropped and tickets torn out in their haste to
get onto the platform to see the boys

NORM has been waiting for the boys and he hurries them to where all
their baggage instruments and the drums are waiting piled up to be
put into the guards van The boys turn and see the oncoming stream of
girls pushing through the barriers and descending on them with yells
and shouts They grab their instruments RINGO makes for the drums
NORM plugs into a handy transformer and using their instruments like a
gun volley to stop the onrush of females the boys blast fire into a
number and start to sing This stops the girls in their tracks and

settle down on whatever they can to listen to them playing

As the boys are playing we CUT BACK into the crowds In the centre we
see PAUL struggling and pulling to fight his way through the girls to
join the other boys He is dragging a very reluctant old man behind
him The old man seems most disgruntled and we can see by his gestures
how unwilling he is to be pulled and pushed forward through all the
girls

At last PAUL reaches the other boys He sits the old man down on a

of cases and joins in the number to the squeals of delight from the
fans The old man sits aloof and proud ignoring the whole proceedings
JOHN GEORGE and RINGO look enquiringly at PAUL who gives a
noncommittal shrug of the shoulders as if to say its not my fault
and the number proceeds

SHOT of sudden horror on JOHNs face PAUL follows his eye line only

see the old man has doffed his cap and is busily collecting money from
a disconcerted crowd PAUL dives hastily into the crowd and with
suitable apologies extracts the old man and with a long suffering sigh
drags him back to the group GEORGE and PAUL hold him firmly as they
finish the number the old man standing there between them
the

As the number finishes and the girls scream and shout with delight

guard blows his whistle NORM and SHAKE grab the instruments and the
drums and with the rest piles the lot into the guards van The BOYS
head into their reserved compartment pursued by the fans but the train
moves off They have successfully repelled all extra boarders

THE BOYS stand and wave to the fans until out of sight line the
girls running along to the end of the platform waving and calling out

INTERIOR RESERVED COMPARTMENT IN THE TRAIN

The boys relax sitting down on one side of the compartment They are
about to settle down and make themselves at home when first RINGO
nudges GEORGE who in turn nudges JOHN Opposite them is sitting the
LITTLE OLD MAN He is holding himself stiff erect and very aloof

The three boys look at him enquiringly but with an elaborate sniff he
looks away from them and out of the window

PAUL catches his eye and winks at the LITTLE OLD MAN He winks back at
PAUL scowls at the other three then looks firmly out of the window
again

The boys turn on PAUL crowding around him

GRANDFATHER joins SHAKE and NORM

NORM
(over Grandfathers head)
Hes very clean isnt he

SHAKE and NORM collect GRANDFATHER and are in the process of leaving
the compartment when a fat upper class city Englishman JOHNSON
attempts to enter There is a bit of confusion and they get tangled up
with each other

JOHNSON
Make up your minds will you

At last SHAKE NORM and GRANDFATHER sort themselves out and JOHNSON
enters with his case The other three go to coffee

JOHNSON puts his case up on the luggage rack then sits down All his
movements are disgruntled he finally picks up his copy of the
Financial Times and burying himself behind it starts to read After a
moment he looks up notices the compartment window is open He gets up
and without so much as a by your leave he closes it glares at the
BOYS and sits down again

The boys exchange looks as if to say Hello Saucy
PAUL

(politely)
Do you mind if we have it opened

JOHNSON
(briefly)
Yes I do
JOHN

He disappears behind his paper before the BOYS can say another word
RINGO pulls a face at the raised paper and switches on his portable
radio A pop number is playing

JOHNSON puts down his paper firmly

JOHNSON
And well have that thing off as well thank
you

RINGO

JOHNSON leans over and switches it off

JOHNSON
An elementary knowledge of the Railway Acts
would tell you Im perfectly within my rights

He smiles frostily

PAUL
Yeah but we want to hear it and theres more
of us than you Were a community like a
majority vote Up the workers and all that
stuff

JOHNSON

The boys troop out of the door into the corridor JOHNSON smiles
triumphantly He is about to settle down to his paper when there is a
tap on the corridor window He looks up and we see pressed against the
window a collection of hideous Beatle faces

PAUL
Eh Mister can we have our ball back

The man jumps to his feet

INTERIOR OF THE CORRIDOR

The boys run away like a pack of school boys and disappear round the
corner

INTERIOR OF THE TRAIN CORRIDOR

From the POV of the door leading to the restaurant car
The boys come down the corridor in full flight laughing away like
happy idiots GEORGE and PAUL pull open the sliding doors The boys

look inside

INTERIOR RESTAURANT CAR

From their POV we see the car is half empty and at a table in the

centre SHAKE and NORM and GRANDFATHER are sitting On the table is a

pile of photos of the boys NORM and SHAKE are arguing NORM is being
very aggressive much to SHAKEs discomfort

NORM

PAUL does so automatically but in the middle of signing he gets
suspicious GRANDFATHER smiles at him charmingly so PAUL finishes
signing

JOHN

GRANDFATHER
Before you go I think its only fair to warn
you about me Grandson dont let our Paul

JOHN RINGO and GEORGE take this up straight away They all pretend to
be girls RINGO jumps into PAULs arms

GEORGE

voice)
If I let you have your own way you little
rascal will you respect me

PAUL
(choked)
Ill murder you Grandfather

JOHN waltzes PAUL down to an empty table and the lads sit down

GEORGE
Eh look at that talent

They all gaze across the aisle From their POV we see two very
attractive young girls RITA and JEAN having coffee

on his head

GRANDFATHER grabs two lumps of sugar from the table and forces them
into RINGOS mouth

GRANDFATHER
Get out while you can ladies his times
coming round for one of his turns

The frightened girls scurry out of the restaurant car The boys look
in

amazement and horror at GRANDFATHER They are completely
flabbergasted

GRANDFATHER smiles at them benignly

JOHN and PAUL run down the corridor SHAKE and NORM turn from the door
and go in the opposite direction GEORGE and RINGO follow after the
other two boys

INTERIOR CORRIDOR OF TRAIN

PAUL and JOHN look into various compartments CLOSE SHOT of RINGO
looking into compartments in the manner of Groucho Marx In one of the
compartments we see from RINGOS POV the occupant a glamorous
woman TANIA with a small lap dog

She is beautifully and most expensively dressed She looks up and sees
RINGO

RINGO smiles at her and she smiles back She then beckons him to join
her

He looks around to see if she means someone else She nods a negative
Who

RINGO looks back enquiringly then points at himself as if to say

me
TANIA smiles enthusiastically
GEORGE has been watching all this

GEORGE
Are you going in

RINGO

No shell only reject me in the end and Ill

be frustrated

GEORGE

You never know you might be lucky this time

RINGO

No I know the psychological pattern and it

plays hell with me drum skins

He blows the glamorous lady a kiss then moves sadly on

INTERIOR FURTHER DOWN THE CORRIDOR

PAUL enters a compartment followed by JOHN The TWO GIRLS RITA and
JEAN from the restaurant car are sitting there

PAUL

Excuse me but have you seen that little old

man we were with
The girls jump up surprised

JOHN

Weve broken out oh the blessed freedom of it

all
(he extends his hands
as if handcuffed)

Eh have you got a nail file these handcuffs

PAUL

Will you stop it Sorry to disturb you miss

He starts to drag JOHN after him

JOHN

I was innocent I was framed I wont go back

JOHN is now by the door he leers at the girls horribly

JOHN
I bet you can guess what I was in for

He cackles like a maniac before disappearing

the door closing after

him

A waiter carrying a tray with champagne and glasses on it passes into
one of the compartments with the blinds down

PAUL
How about that one

He moves towards the compartment
PAUL
(to Ringo and George)
Did you look in here
GEORGE
No I mean its probably a honeymoon couple or

a company director or something

PAUL
Well lets broaden our outlook

PAUL opens the door of the compartment

INTERIOR OF COMPARTMENT

From the BOYS POV we see GRANDFATHER and the elderly lady AUDREY
sipping champagne and nibbling caviar on toast

GRANDFATHER

Congratulate me boys Im engaged

PAUL enters and crosses over to him

PAUL
Oh no youre not Youve gone too far this

by the arm)
Ill refuse me consent hes over-age

AUDREY grabs GRANDFATHERs other arm and pulls back

AUDREY
Leave him alone after all hes done for you is
this the way you repay him

A tug of war now starts between PAUL and AUDREY

PAUL
(pulling)
Him hes never done anything for anybody in
his life
AUDREY
(pulling)

You dare to say that when even those ridiculous
clothes you are wearing were bought when you
forced him to sell out his gilt edged
Indomitables

JOHN and GEORGE jump on the seat egging PAUL and AUDREY on

JOHN
Come on Auntie youre winning

GEORGE
Get in there Paul shes weakening

RINGO attempts to interfere

RINGO
Look Missus this is all a misunderstanding

AUDREY
Keep away from me you depraved lout I know

RINGO
Ywhat

She hits RINGO with her handbag and continues struggling with PAUL for
GRANDFATHER RINGO grabs her handbag to stop her hitting him

RINGO
Hes given me a bad character blackguarding me
name to all and sundry Hes got to be stopped
Its not fair

RINGO pushes out into the corridor forgetting that he is holding the
womans handbag

A voice shouts off from outside

VOICE OFF
Thats one of them stop thief

INTERIOR CORRIDOR

From Ringos POV we see down to the right the city man JOHNSON
approaching with a GUARD RINGO turns the other way to the left when

he
is joined by the three other boys From their POV down the
corridor we see the two girls autograph books in hand followed by
ten
girls from the same school
Both groups are closing in on the BOYS Theres no escape
RINGO

handbag in his hand)
Oh Mother
15 INTERIOR LUGGAGE VAN
Very dark and behind bars we see GRANDFATHER He is sitting crouched
up on a wooden box tea chest and looks pretty miserable He turns
towards the CAMERA in the foreground of the SHOT we see PAUL
standing
In the background an impassive GUARD is reading a paper which he does
throughout the scene
GRANDFATHER
(bitterly)
And to think me own grandson would have let
them put me behind bars
PAUL
Dont dramatise
The CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see GRANDFATHER in the luggage
compartment

of the guards van In with him are a crate of chickens and a dog The
chickens peck at him GRANDFATHER moves listlessly away

PAUL
Lets face it youre lucky to be here If
theyd have had their way youd have been
dropped off at Stafford already

GRANDFATHER proudly turns away from PAUL who dodges round so he can
still see his face

PAUL
Well youve got to admit youve upset a lot of
people At least I can keep my eye on you while
youre stuck in here

GRANDFATHER turns away again

PAUL
All right how about Ringo I mean hes
very upset you know and as far as your

girlfriend little Audreys concerned shes
finished with men for the rest of her natural
and another thing

GRANDFATHER
A harmless bit of fun aah none of you have
any sense of humour left these days

PAUL
Oh its all right for you but those two girls
were scared to death Honest Grandad why I
mean why do you do these things

GRANDFATHER
(cutting in)
Youre left-handed arent you Paul

PAUL
Yeah so what

GRANDFATHER
Why do you always use your left hand

PAUL
Well dont be daft Ive got to

GRANDFATHER
And I take a left-handed view of life Ive got

PAUL grins After a moment of looking at him PAUL opens the door of
the luggage compartment and joins GRANDFATHER on a box

PAUL
Shove up

GRANDFATHER produces a penny

GRANDFATHER
Odds or evens
PAUL sighs
PAUL
Odds

GRANDFATHER flips the coin

The guards van door opens and JOHN GEORGE and RINGO come in with

There is a pause and JOHN deliberately rises slowly and crosses to his
coat He puts it on and walks to the door

JOHN
While the swines away the piglets can play
Well come on what are we waiting for

With a whoop PAUL GEORGE and RINGO collect their coats and head for
the door

GRANDFATHER

They disappear After a moment GRANDFATHER takes out Ringos card
CU GRANDFATHER

GRANDFATHER
And a free champagne buffet

He grins to himself At this moment a WAITER enters with a tray He is
clad in tails and GRANDFATHER eyes them longingly measuring himself
the while alongside the startled waiter He leaves us with no doubt in
our minds what he wants ie the waiters suit
24 INTERIOR DANCING CLUB NIGHT

The club is the latest in modern decor and full of teenagers all

enjoying themselves The CAMERA wanders around the club till it
finally

table The music is blaring away from a juke box and the BOYS join the

dancers They are recognised and given smiles and nods of
encouragement

by all the other customers During this scene we

CUT AWAY

25 INTERIOR BOYDS CLUB NIGHT

The whole atmosphere is of quiet elegance and loud wealth Around the
baccarat table the rich bored customers sit barely moving a face
muscle as they languidly murmur suivez and banco to the dealer as
he operates the shoe The manager of the club is beaming with
satisfaction as he surveys his customers One of these customers is
clad in evening dress and he has his back to us The rest of the
players (male) are in suits By each of them is standing a lush lady
with a bored sophisticated face that looks as if it has been painted
on From the REVERSE of the LAST SHOT we now see the solitary evening
dress player is GRANDFATHER He looks around him and wipes off his
look
of enjoyment and elaborately out-bores everyone in the room

The CROUPIER uses the spatula to pick up a card GRANDFATHER grabs it
and scoops some sandwiches off a passing tray

28 INTERIOR DANCING CLUB

The BOYS are at their table again laughing and enjoying themselves
when suddenly their faces freeze

From their POV we see NORM standing glowering down at them With

him
is SHAKE Reluctantly the BOYS arise and follow NORM out
29 INTERIOR BOYDS
GRANDFATHER is looking worried at the call of the card he loses and we
see that all his chips have gone He notices the waiter delivering
snacks and champagne to a couple so quick as a flash he places a
handkerchief over his arm and writing a bill out on a piece of paper
presents it to the couple and collects payment in chips He then
resumes playing

They grab the protesting GRANDFATHER and drag him into the reception

area He keeps trying to return to BLONDE and table GEORGE and RINGO

each take an end of the velvet cord hanging between the two
stanchions

They exchange ends and re-hook it thus encircling GRANDFATHER by the

entrance desk They then go to settle up

Chandler
34 EXTERIOR STREET

As the big car overtakes a Company Directors Rolls JOHN lowers his
window and the boys let out an imaginary hail of bullets at the
Executive in the back He reacts violently and starts to shout at

them
As he does so he presses the button of his window so that we hear
only part of it But what we do is unpleasant He immediately presses
the button and the window rises
RINGO and PAUL jump out of the car RINGO takes two drumsticks from

his
coat pocket and using them as banderillas inserts them with style
into the radiator grill (VO Ole from the BOYS) PAUL then using
his coat as a matadors cloak does a butterfly pass at the car which
has just started up narrowly missing him but he keeps in the matador
position

EXTERIOR OF AN OLD VICTORIAN MUSIC HALL THEATRE

Which has been converted to the TV studios

There are a few groups of GIRL FANS standing outside the front of the
theatre but against the kerb of the pavement is a night-watchmans
canvas hut and brazier

The car approaches

INTERIOR OF THE CAR

NORM
Get ready John open the door and as it draws
up out you go and straight in

JOHN nods and opens the door The FANS start to swarm round them To
escape the BOYS dash into the night-watchmans canvas hut pick it up
and run with it to the stage door revealing the night-watchman
staring in astonishment

At the door the BOYS put the hut down and enter the theatre

INTERIOR STAGE DOOR ENTRANCE

As the BOYS enter two PRO men in dark suits stiff white collars
and old school ties step forward and smile menacingly

FIRST PRO MAN
(menacingly)
Press conference theyre waiting for you

NORM
(jovially)
Give us a couple of shakes to get our breath

and

of

is

FIRST PRO MAN
(more menacingly)
Theyre waiting now

And without more ado they grab an arm each and march the protesting
NORM towards the stairs that lead to the dress circle

PAUL
Eh this lot means it Theyre even taking

hostages

The BOYS SHAKE and GRANDFATHER rush after the rapidly disappearing
NORM who by now is half way up the stairs

INTERIOR OF DRESS CIRCLE LOUNGE BALLROOM

It is empty except for two barmaids poised ready to serve standing
behind trestle tables full of drinks and sandwiches The dark suited
MEN enter with NORM and close behind them follow GRANDFATHER SHAKE

the boys The group arrives at the centre of the lounge and have time
to look about and see the food but before they can get to it from all
directions NEWSPAPERMEN and PHOTOGRAPHERS converge upon them

Now begins an elaborate tug-of-war between various PHOTOGRAPHERS using
their flash attachments and REPORTERS to capture a Beatle and in the
midst of this running battle a man with a portable recorder is trying
to interview them Together and singly the BOYS are pushed about the
room and while this goes on a hard core of NEWSPAPERMEN are busily
devouring sandwiches and pouring themselves drinks to the annoyance

the BARMAIDS
Every time one of the BOYS attempts to get a sandwich or a drink it

either too late the plate is empty or they are intercepted The
single and constant thing we see in the scene is the pushing and
pulling heavy impersonal handling the boys are just things to be
placed like still life in one advantageous position after another
During the scene these individual exchanges take place

SOUND REPORTER

JOHN
Im torn between Zen and Im all right Jack

GEORGE

PAUL
No actually were just good friends

HIGH SHOT of the press reception and we see the BOYS ease their way

until they get to the curtained entrance to the dress circle
completely unnoticed they slip through

INTERIOR THEATRE DRESS CIRCLE

The BOYS come up the stairs into the Dress Circle proper GRANDFATHER
and SHAKE are sitting there having a picnic of beer and sandwiches

PAUL
(ironically)
Anything to spare

GRANDFATHER
Weve just finished Pauly Hey George write
us your John Henry on this picture

GEORGE
Sure
(He does so)

PAUL
Ah well Eh look

He points and from PAULS POV we see on stage the setting up of
the show scenery and lights cameras and sound equipment are being

into position by a small army of studio staff DANCERS and SINGERS are
milling about as well

PAUL
Lets go and muck in

JOHN
Aye before anyone stops us

They exit to rows of the dress circle and go through the entrance down
the narrow stairs to the stalls and on to the stage that is built and
extended right into the stalls which are partly covered up

INTERIOR STAGE
Everyone is so busy that they hardly notice the BOYS who wander about
and examine the studio equipment A load of three drum sets are being

brought on stage and a voice shouts out

VOICE
Here what about these electric guitars
SHAKE
Where are they

VOICE
Back here mate

SHAKE
(going towards the voice)
Im coming

RINGO is busy setting up his drums and men are setting up the other
sets He drops a stick and the FLOOR MANAGER retrieves it and is about
to tap the drum The FLOOR MANAGER is a languid young man

RINGO
Leave them drums alone

FLOOR MANAGER
Oh surely one can have a tiny touch

RINGO
If you so much as breathe heavy on them Im
out on strike

FLOOR MANAGER
Arent you being rather arbitrary

RINGO
Thats right retreat behind a smoke screen of
bourgeois cliches I dont go round messing
about with your ear-phones do I

FLOOR MANAGER
Spoil sport

RINGO
Well

RINGO fusses like a mother hen clucking over his drums The FLOOR
MANAGER is furious

GEORGE
Hes very touchy about those his drums they
loom large in his legend

RINGO gives his drums a defiant crash and JOHN and PAUL stop whatever
they are up to and hurry over

PAUL
Whats up
GEORGE
(pointing)

Hes sulking again

JOHN

Ill show him

He picks up a set of drum sticks and bashes back at RINGO who does a
more complicated drum roll GEORGE now joins in and to PAULS
encouragement a drum duel starts completely naturally and improvised
During this encounter the work proceeds around them and the guitars

brought on and SHAKE sets them to working order PAUL first then JOHN
and GEORGE take up their own instruments and out of the drum duel
emerges one of their numbers

INTERIOR RAMP

As the number finishes a baldheaded man (he is the TV director)
storms down the ramp that leads from the control box under the dress
circle

DIRECTOR
(with over-exaggerated calm)
All right Im sorry and lets hear no more about
it If thats your opinion youre probably
right Look if you think Im unsuitable lets
have it out in the open I cant stand these
back-stage politics

By the end of this speech he is standing in front of JOHN who takes
scene in his stride

JOHN
Arent you tending to black and white this
whole situation

DIRECTOR
Well quite honestly I wasnt expecting a
musical arranger who would question my
ability picture-wise

JOHN
(to the others)
I could listen to him for hours

PAUL
Heave to whats all this about a musical
arranger

DIRECTOR

Mr McCartney Senior

The BOYS have a giggle at the very idea and at this moment GRANDFATHER
appears from behind the DIRECTOR

GRANDFATHER
Hey Pauly theyre trying to fob you off wid
this musical charlatan but Ive given him the
test
DIRECTOR
(bravely)
Im quite happy to be replaced

GRANDFATHER
(indicating the director)
Hes a typical buck-passer

DIRECTOR
I won an award

JOHN
A likely story

DIRECTOR
Its on the wall in my office

At this moment NORM comes on the stage confident cigar in mouth and
serene

NORM
Hello our lot everyone happy

The BOYS the DIRECTOR FLOOR MANAGER and GRANDFATHER turn on him and
stare silently

NORM
All right all right If you dont need this
lot Ill lock em up in the dressing room till
you do

DIRECTOR
Please do Ill not need them for fifteen
minutes Thank you

He glares at GRANDFATHER who glares right back The DIRECTOR walks
away
with the FLOOR MANAGER pacifying him

DIRECTOR
Give me a bottle of milk and a packet of
Oblivion Oh its a plot I see it now its
all a plot

They go left towards the back-stage
NORM

Now come on Ive got the key

He leads the lads off right RINGO is last as he is putting his drum
sticks down safely

NORM and the BOYS turn on him

NORM

GEORGE

RINGO glares at them and follows quickly As the BOYS move off after
NORM they pass the next act waiting for rehearsal It is an elegant
man in full-tail suit meticulously adjusting his cuff-links Beside

is a free-standing sign reading Leslie Jackson and his ten
disappearing doves The BOYS pass him and go through the door
GRANDFATHER stops and looks at the performer with respect

GRANDFATHER
I cant tell you how much Ive enjoyed your act

He slaps the man on the back with happy camaraderie There is the

of a dove a few feathers fall out of the sleeve of the mans coat and
he and GRANDFATHER look down at the floor The man glares at
GRANDFATHER takes out a pen from his pocket crosses out 10 on his
sign and writes 9 in its place puts the pen back in his pocket and
starts towards the centre stage putting on a false performers smile

he does

INTERIOR THEATRE BACK-STAGE CORRIDOR

The BOYS move down the narrow stairs and out of the ground floor
dressing rooms stream a steady flow of costumed actors and actresses
They engulf the lads and force them against the wall -- the actors are
all making for the stage door As the actors push past the boys we see
the boys excited faces their mouths watering for the costumes JOHN
touches the costume on one actor

JOHN

INTERIOR DRESSING ROOM AND CORRIDOR

RINGOS attention is caught by a door He crosses and opens it

out to a fire escape The others join him and the four boys step
through the door and onto the fire escape

EXTERIOR TOP OF FIRE ESCAPE

From the BOYS POV we see down below into the property yard behind
the theatre It is a long narrow yard full of old coaches motor cars
and all the general debris of hundreds of sets from past theatre

Through the piles of heaped high junk there are a couple of narrow
alleyways

The BOYS scamper down the fire escape

When they reach the bottom of the alleyways there is a large door
They open it and look through

From their POV we see a large green field quite empty The boys

through the doorway into the field We now see from a HELICOPTER SHOT
the four BOYS standing together surrounded by space

It is the first time they have been alone and unconfined all day

They look at each other and grin then first GEORGE and PAUL let
a whoop and run towards the centre of the field after a moment JOHN
and RINGO follow them The BOYS pick up some loose straw and insert it

under JOHNS cap and sleeves turning him into a scarecrow

The four BOYS dash about madly calling out to one another and

generally

them

horsing around Out of this emerges an imaginary game of soccer and
although there is no ball the game is fast and furious After a few
moments the long shadow of a man falls across the grass

MANS VOICE
(off)
I suppose you know this is private property
The boys freeze
From their POV we see a big burly middle-aged man glowering at
The boys exchange rueful glances and under the big mans eye mooch

INTERIOR CORRIDOR BACK-STAGE

GRANDFATHER is sneaking down the corridor a pile of photos under his
arm

INTERIOR TV THEATRE UNDERNEATH THE STAGE

Under the stage the usual set of wooden columns that support the stage
with lots of furniture and a single light is on it is placed by the
orchestras entrance to the orchestra pit GRANDFATHER comes down the
stairs and winds his way through the columns until he finds himself a
safe little cubby hole and settles himself under the light He spreads
the signed photos of the BOYS in front of him and adjusting an old-
fashioned pair of glasses ball-point pen in hand begins to copy the
BOYS signatures on to the fresh photos tutting at his failures and
chuckling at his successes After a moment there is a sound of

coming down the stairs GRANDFATHER darts into a dark patch out of
sight

The menacing shadows appear on the stairway

NORM (voice off)
Theres no one here

SHAKE (voice off
This is the only way they could have gone

We now see GRANDFATHER holding himself stiffly in he is on some sort
of raised platform and he fidgets and in doing so he knocks a lever of
some sort Slowly GRANDFATHER ascends out of shot with a light that
grows bigger above him

INTERIOR TV THEATRE STAGE

A rehearsal of the toast scene from a Strauss Operetta The entire
stage is full of SINGERS glasses in hand they are singing away at

other but in true opera tradition they are addressing out to the
audience Slowly in-between the leading man and leading woman who are
about to embrace a stage trap opens and a blinking surprised
GRANDFATHER appears Here we INTERCUT to the TV Control Room for
amazed reaction shots of the DIRECTOR and control room CREW

Back now on the stage the toast song reaches its climax and the
man and woman rush into each others arms GRANDFATHER sandwiched

between them

INTERIOR BACKSTAGE AREA

Five beautiful MODELS are standing about in costume One is knitting a
loose wool sweater which is almost completed There is the sound of a
juggling acts music off and a few of the girls are looking off

the centre stage At the edge of frame is a collapsible table covered
with green baize On it are three spaced white plates

From the door off stage above which is a sign To Canteen and
Production Offices GRANDFATHER enters eating a plate of spaghetti on
toast The knitting GIRL sees him and in mime asks him to stand

so that she can measure the sweater against him GRANDFATHER eager to
help puts his plate of food on the green table between plates two and
three He goes to be measured with the sweater

From the onstage area a jugglers ASSISTANT (pretty girl) in costume
backs up and with the usual theatrical flourishes picks up without
looking plate number ONE and throws it off screen towards centre
stage There is a drum roll from orchestra She then throws plate
number TWO We CUT on stage to the JUGGLER now balancing the two
spinning plates on two poles one in each hand He has another pole in
his mouth and nods to his ASSISTANT asking for the THIRD plate

We CUT BACK to the ASSISTANT who still not looking throws plate

which is GRANDFATHERs There is the sound of an orchestra raggedly
stopping and all the hangers-on in the scene look off interestedly

We hear the DIRECTORs voice
DIRECTOR (VO)
All right hold it hold it OK John wipe
him down and well carry on with the next act

only remaining plate looks at it wondering where his food has gone

INTERIOR TV STUDIO FLOOR

PAUL
(to Ringo)

NORM appears down the ramp speaking as he approaches

NORM
All right our lot make-up

INTERIOR MAKE UP ROOM

A smallish room with a line of chairs facing a wall mirror and a long
table Each place is clearly marked and above each mirror a girls
name Betty Angela Deirdre Jenny

SHAKE and GRANDFATHER are sitting in splendid isolation They are
staring each other out

SHAKE
You blinked

GRANDFATHER

The BOYS enter
SHAKE

He indicates RINGO who ignores him

NORM
Stop picking on him

RINGO
I dont need you to defend me yknow Norm

JOHN
Leave him alone hes got swine fever

NORM
Sit down the lot of you

At this moment several actors come into the room They are all dressed

in the uniform of officers in Wellingtons army Together with the
boys

they sit down Beatles and soldiers all mixed up

Now a group of several pretty make-up girls make an entrance and the
boys herald their arrival with a chorus of aye ayes and wolf
whistles JOHN meanwhile has helped himself to a big beard and the
other lads are generally messing about with assorted make-up things

HEAD MAKE UP GIRL
Oh this is impossible Well never get you
all done in time

ACTOR

makes no difference to them whether theyre
made up or not
(sees John with beard)
And whos me then

JOHN

on the mirror)
Do you want a punch up your frogged tunic

NORM fights his way to JOHN

NORM
Now listen John behave yourself or Ill
murder you and Shake take that wig off it
suits you
girls

SHAKE has a long blond girls wig on With the assistance of the

NORM gets the boys seated into the chairs nearest the door

For some

reason RINGO now has a Guardsmans busby wedged down almost over his
eyes and is sitting with it under a hair drier reading a copy of

Queen Magazine

NORM
(to Ringo)
What do you think are youre up to

RINGO
Someone put it on me

JOHN
Excuses thats all we get and you know you
fancy yourself in the Coldstreams

The GIRLS now move in and put make up bibs on the BOYS and start to

powder them off

JOHN
You wont interfere with the basic rugged
concept of my personality will you girl

PAUL
Eh dont take out me lines

GEORGE
Yeah they give him that Je ne sais quoi
rakish air
The lads laugh with pleasure
RINGO decides to try a little joke
RINGO
(indicating the busby he is still
wearing)

Short back and sides please

The other look at him with mock disgust

PAUL
Behave

JOHN
Foreign devil

GEORGE

Control yourself
GRANDFATHER has been watching the powdering process
GRANDFATHER

In my considered opinion youre a bunch of
sissies
JOHN grabs a powder puff from his girl

JOHN
You know youre only jealous

And dabs the old man liberally with the powder much to GRANDFATHERs
annoyance

NORM
Leave him alone Lennon or Ill tell them all
the truth about you

JOHN
You wouldnt
NORM
I would though
NORM goes out
PAUL

Whats he know

JOHN
Nothing hes trying to brainwash me and give
me personality doubts oh hes a swine but

a clever swine mind

GRANDFATHER
(impatiently)
Lookit I thought I was supposed to be getting
a change of scenery and so far Ive seen a
train and a room a car and a room and a room
and a room Well thats maybe all right for a
bunch of powdered gee-gaws like you lot but Im
feeling decidedly strait-jacketed This is no
life for a free-booting agent of my stamp Im
a frustrated man and that class of McCartney is
a dangerous McCartney

GIRL
(admiringly)
What a clean old man

GRANDFATHER
(touchingly)
Youre too young for a fella of my
cosmopolitan tastes so dont press your luck

JOHN
Hes sex-obsessed the older generation are
leading this country to galloping ruin

NORM returns leaving the door open the boys hear the sound of music
coming from the studio
NORM
Theyre nearly ready for you Theyre just
finishing the band call

JOHN
(jumping from his seat)
Gear Come on girls lets have a bit of a
dance

JOHNS GIRL
I dont think its allowed

JOHN
Well it wouldnt be any fun if it was

The BOYS drag the make-up GIRLS out of the room and into the studio
The GIRLS are still trying to finish making the BOYS up
As the BOYS and MAKE-UP GIRLS dance past we see one of the Strauss
singers combing his long hair straight back Two STAGE HANDS swing a
wind machine past him and his hair is blown straight forward into a
Beatle cut
JOHN
(passing him)

Never

During dance GEORGE takes off wig and places it on dummy revealing
identical hair underneath

55 INTERIOR TV STUDIO FLOOR

The work is still going on and the music is up full blast the BOYS
enter and with the GIRLS and they start a wild dance hippy shake
zulu blue beat the lot LIONEL and DANCERS are doing their routine

on
one side of the stage it becomes a challenge dance between both
groups JOHN swings his GIRL onto the motorized CAMERA Western style
and starts to track through the GROUP GEORGE is on another CAMERA
56 INTERIOR CONTROL ROOM

The whole control room crew are watching the dance on all the
monitors
The DIRECTOR is about to stop the boys but his GIRL PA glares at

him
with a shrug he lets the dance go on
We now cut between the dancers on the monitors and the boys actual
dancing down on the studio floor When the recorded music stops they
grab their instruments and go into a number
So we can watch every aspect of their work and with so many monitors
it

gives the impression that there are many more boys than just four
When the number finally ends we are back in the studio on the floor

57 INTERIOR TV STUDIO FLOOR

DIRECTORS VOICE OVER TANNOY
Thank you gentlemen you can break now while we
push on with the show

The boys acknowledge this with a quaver of guitar chords and a drum
roll

INTERIOR BACKSTAGE

A man whose act is playing tunes by hitting himself on the head is
swallowing a handful of aspirin tablets He starts rehearsing his act
which consists of throwing his head back and slapping his cheeks Next
to him a JUGGLER is practising with four table tennis balls

GRANDFATHER passes him and bumps his arm slightly Only 3 balls come
down There is the sound of coughing off

We
CUT TO

THE HEAD-PLAYER being patted on the back The ball drops out of his
mouth and bounces slowly on the studio floor

INTERIOR TV STUDIO CANTEEN

The canteen is about half full of actors many of which are dressed as
Nazi soldiers with mock blood bandages and arm bands Also there are

sprinkling of TV people At a table sits GRANDFATHER and RINGO

is deeply engrossed in a book and GRANDFATHER has a near empty cup of
tea in front of him The old man is bored and looks about him slyly

then looks at Ringo who is innocently occupied a malicious gleam

into GRANDFATHERs eye He decides to have a go at RINGO and sits
staring at him RINGO gradually becomes aware of the stare and shifts
uncomfortably then tries to continue reading his book

GRANDFATHER
(disgustedly to no one
in particular)
Will you ever look at him sitting there wid
his hooter scraping away at that book

RINGO
Well whats the matter with that

GRANDFATHER
(taking the book from him)
Have you no natural resources of your own Have
they even robbed you of that

RINGO
(snatching back his book
You can learn from books

GRANDFATHER
Can you now Aah sheeps heads You learn
more by getting out there and living

RINGO
Out where
GRANDFATHER
Any old where but not our little Richard

oh no When youre not thumping them pagan
skins youre tormenting your eyes wid that
rubbish

RINGO
(defiantly)
Books are good

GRANDFATHER
(countering)
Paradings better

RINGO
Parading
GRANDFATHER
(marching up and down the canteen)
Thats it parading the streets trailing
your coat bowling along living
RINGO

Well I am living arent I

GRANDFATHER
Youre living are you When was the last time
you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy When did
you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool
appraising stare

RINGO
Eh youre a bit old for that sort of chat

GRANDFATHER

At least Ive a backlog of memories but all
youve got is that book

RINGO
Aaah stop picking on me youre as bad as
the rest of them
GRANDFATHER
So you are a man after all

RINGO
Whats that mean

GRANDFATHER
Do you think I havent noticed do you think
I wasnt aware of the drift Oh you poor

unfortunate scuff theyve driven you into
books by their cruel unnatural treatment
exploiting your good nature

RINGO
(not too sure)
Oh I dunno
GRANDFATHER
(confidingly)
And that lots never happier than when theyre
jeering at you and where would they be

without the steady support of your drum beat

RINGO
Yeah thats right

GRANDFATHER
And whats it all come to in the end

RINGO
(defensively)
Yeah whats in it for me
GRANDFATHER
A book
RINGO
Yeah a bloomin book

He throws the book down

GRANDFATHER
When you could be out there betraying a rich
American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti
before youre too old like me A fine neat and
trim lad the class of you should be helping
himself to lifes goodies before the sands run
out Being an old age pensioners a terrible
drag on a man and every second you waste is
bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the
Post Office

RINGO
Yeah funny really ‘cos Id never thought
of it but being middle-aged and old takes up
most of your time doesnt it
GRANDFATHER
(nodding)
Youre only right
RINGO
(nodding back)
Im not wrong

There is a pause then RINGO rises and crosses to the door

GRANDFATHER
Where are you off to

RINGO
Im going parading before its too late

RINGO leaves and GRANDFATHER laughs at what he has done then realizes
its full meaning and looks worried

59 INTERIOR CORRIDOR and STAIRWAY

RINGO comes along the corridor then down the narrow stairs Half-way
down he comes face to face with GEORGE who is coming up the stairs

GEORGE
Eh Ringo do you know what happened to me

As he goes round the corner RINGO turns on the surprised GEORGE
RINGO
You want to stop being so scornful its

glares at him

bends down and pulls it out of the ground It is quite big Three
quarters of it being below the surface Having got it he now decides

throw it away As he does so the same POLICEMAN rides past on a
bicycle

POLICEMAN

Before RINGO has time to answer the man has disappeared

scuffle together They are obviously a gang RINGO is left alone

64 INTERIOR CORRIDOR TV THEATRE

GEORGE comes round the corner looking for RINGO then grins and walks

past a sign saying Canteen and Production Office Opposite He comes

to the exit door crosses to a modern building across from the
theatre

He enters the building

65 INTERIOR OFFICE

It is the reception room that leads to an inner office Behind a desk
sits a smart young woman typing busily as GEORGE enters He is
surprised when he sees the girl she looks up and speaks to him at
once

SECRETARY

INTERIOR THE INNER OFFICE

A large room part production office with models and sets drawing
board with ground plans the other part of the room a mixture of Pop

Behind a large desk sits SIMON MARSHAL a bland but slightly irritable
young man of about thirty-five He is wearing the ultimate in the
current smart set fashion He is attended by a couple of underlings
ADRIAN and TONY and behind him on the wall is a poster of a girl
Across the poster is printed Way Out your own TV Special

foreigners and village idiots

EXTERIOR STREET PUB ON THE CORNER

The sign on the pub is Liverpool Arms RINGO is standing looking up at
it He decides to go in and does so

INTERIOR TV CONTROL ROOM

The atmosphere is tense GRANDFATHER is standing miserable in front of
the DIRECTOR the criminal confronted by the judge SHAKE and NORM are
flanking him grimly

GRANDFATHER
Im sorry lads I didnt mean it honest

DIRECTOR
If he says that again Ill strike him

SHAKE
(unconvincingly)
Theyll be back theyre good lads theyll be
back
DIRECTOR
(disgusted)

Yes Well theyve got only ten minutes to the
final run-through

GRANDFATHER
I meant no harm I was only trying to encourage
little Ringo to enjoy himself

NORM

(grimly CU)
God knows what youve unleashed on the
unsuspecting South Itll be wine women and
song all the way with Ringo once hes got the
taste for it

INT PUB PUBLIC BAR

CLOSE-UP on RINGO He is eating a bone dry sandwich that curls up at
the end He puts it down with disgust He has a lager glass in his
hand

BARMAID
(accusingly)

That was fresh this morning

We now see the pub is full of enormous cockney workmen downing pints
RINGO is very much alone He moves away from the bar towards a group
that is standing together theyve an average height of over six-foot
There is a group at a dart board Another group is playing bar

skittles

without

swings

about

and a third group is around a pin-ball table

Near the bar is a shove-halfpenny board with two players There is a
caged parrot nearby

BARMAID
(to Ringo)
Thatll be two and nine

RINGO fumbles some change out of his pocket A few coppers fall from
his hand on to the shove-halfpenny board just as the crucial point has
been made The men glare at him Embarrassed he moves away and

looking places his glass on the skittles table just as a player

the string which hits Ringos glass More embarrassed RINGO backs
away unfortunately into the pin-table just as a winning score is

to be reached He bumps it very slightly but enough to cause it to
TILT He then moves to the dart board By this time most of the pub is
staring at him With great style he takes the darts The first throw
goes into a cheese sandwich which a man is pointing in demonstration
The second we see arrive into a pint of bitter and then we see RINGO
shoot the third dart and hear the sound of the parrot shouting

angrily

off The BARMAID has had enough

BARMAID
Right On your way

RINGO
Ywhat

BARMAID

You heard on your way troublemaker
Now the centre of attention RINGO backs out of the pub followed by
every eye in the place the BARMAID and a few players following him to
the door

EXTERIOR STREET OUTSIDE PUB

RINGO comes out and crosses road watched by the POLICEMAN who is now
quite suspicious

EXTERIOR STREET

PAUL comes down the street looking about him for RINGO In the street
is an old building the sort of place that is highly favoured for TV
rehearsals There is a sign on the door TV Rehearsal Room As PAUL
draws near a load of actors and extras etc are leaving they are in
costume they are the ones who earlier had been going to a word
rehearsal When PAUL gets near the entrance he decides to go inside

INTERIOR HALL

PAUL enters and wanders about He reaches a door pushes it open and
looks in He sees a GIRL clad in period costume She is moving around
the room and obviously acting PAUL watches her for a moment and then
decides to go in

INTERIOR REHEARSAL ROOM

PAUL goes into the room The GIRL is in mid-flight She is very young
and lovely and completely engrossed in what she is doing The room is
absolutely empty except for PAUL and herself She is acting in the
manner of an eighteenth-century coquette or to be precise the voice
English actresses use when they think they are being true to the
costume period her youth however makes it all very charming

GIRL
If I believed you sir I might do those things
and walk those ways only to find myself on
Problems Path But I cannot believe you and
all those urgings serve only as a proof that you
will lie and lie again to gain your purpose with
me

She dances lightly away from an imaginary lover and as she turns she
sees PAUL who is as engrossed in the scene as she was

GIRL
(surprised)
Oh
PAUL
(enthusiastically)
Well go head do the next bit
GIRL

Go away Youve spoilt it

PAUL
Oh sorry I spoke

He makes no attempt to go He simply continues to look steadily at the
girl then he smiles at her She is undecided what to do next

GIRL

handwritten by your own sweet boys The chance

fortunate sisters

The CAMERA PULLS back and we see GRANDFATHER is surrounded by girls

have broken from the queue and are doing a brisk trade with the old
man He has a large sign on which is written Get your genuine
autographed Beatles photographs On the edge of the crowd two
POLICEMEN are trying to force the girls back into the queue Finally
they wade through the girls and confront GRANDFATHER They look at the
old man quizzically he stares back coldly They indicate he should

it and quick but GRANDFATHER defiantly glares back at them So with a
sigh they grab an arm each and escort the old man off

INTERIOR POLICE STATION

It is the reception desk and behind it is the DESK SERGEANT After a

POLICEMAN

RINGO

At that moment there is a loud series of noises off camera furious
shouting and dull crashes of wood

SERGEANT
Hello its going to be one of those nights is
it
(to policeman)
Sit Charley Peace down over there

The POLICEMAN takes RINGO to a bench and sits him down as GRANDFATHER
and the two POLICEMEN who were with him enter The sign is tattered
and is being lugged after them

GRANDFATHER
Well you got me here so do your worst but Ill
take one of you with me
(kicks the nearest policeman)
Oh I know your game get me in the tiled room
and out come the rubber hoses but Ill defy you

GRANDFATHER leans across the desk and hisses at the SERGEANT

GRANDFATHER

in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out

The POLICEMEN hurtle GRANDFATHER firmly but gently over to the bench

which RINGO is sitting and then return to the desk for a whispered
conference with the SERGEANT Meanwhile in full conspiratorial fashion
GRANDFATHER talks to RINGO out of the side of his mouth

GRANDFATHER

RINGO

SERGEANT

So you just brought the old chap out of the
crowd for his own good

POLICEMAN

station

SERGEANT

Shot of GRANDFATHER watching POLICEMEN intently and muttering words as
he does

RINGO

GRANDFATHER
Lip reading

RINGO

GRANDFATHER

The POLICEMEN make a move towards GRANDFATHER and RINGO

GRANDFATHER

GRANDFATHER

He dashes out of the door followed by the POLICEMAN who has his pile

of
photos
SERGEANT

80 EXTERIOR STREET
GRANDFATHER is running at top speed down the street He is breathing
heavily and runs as if pursued by the hounds of hell The street
however is entirely empty and no one is even in sight As he reaches
the top of the street he pauses and turning looks around him From
his
POV we see just how empty the street is and heaving a sigh of
relief

GRANDFATHER cackles to himself His triumph is short lived At this
precise moment down the street comes a parade of police vehicles a
Black Maria an escorting police motor bike patrol and an ordinary
squad car The procession draws up and the street is full of policemen
getting out of the Black Maria and squad car and off motor bikes

CLOSE-UP GRANDFATHERs horrified face

GRANDFATHER
Be God theyve called up reinforcements the
dragnets out

He dashes off wildly in the general direction of the theatre He has
been completely unnoticed by the policemen who are lining up for a
last
minute inspection by the inspector in charge The inspector is like a
commander-in-chief of a spear-head attack force

They smartly march off in the direction taken by GRANDFATHER

81 INTERIOR TV THEATRE CONTROL ROOM

DIRECTOR
(watching the clock)
Only half an hour and youre on

GEORGE
Can I say something

The director clutches at any straw

DIRECTOR
(hopefully)
Yes anything

GEORGE
(earnestly)
Its highly unlikely well be on I mean the
law of averages are against you and it seems
that etc etc

But his speech is drowned by the pitiful moans of the DIRECTOR

82 EXTERIOR TV THEATRE STAGE DOOR

The four little boys from the canal are being driven away by the
security guard

GUARD
(going back into theatre)
Ill have the hides off of you lot

The kids retreat as GRANDFATHER pants into shot ignoring the kids he
enters the stage door but in a second he is out again grasped firmly

by the collar by the security guard

GUARD
You ought to be ashamed of yourself Go home

GRANDFATHER
I must see Pauly

GUARD
Go home then and see him on the telly

The GUARD re-enters the stage door

GRANDFATHER looks around him and sees the four kids He hustles over
and after a whispered conference we hear his offer

GRANDFATHER
Can you fix him for me
BOYS

Yeah

GRANDFATHER
Sixpence

BOY
Each

GRANDFATHER is about to argue

GRANDFATHER
Oh all right
BOY
And in advance
GRANDFATHER
(disgusted)

Mercenary
But he hands over the money The kids rush in the stage door and after
a moment the furious GUARD chases them out and down the alley
GRANDFATHER chuckling nips in the door

83 INTERIOR TV CONTROL ROOM ON STAGE

GRANDFATHER is being chased by several studio attendants he is
dodging

behind equipment He finally gets on a sound boom trolley and uses it

as a weapon to keep his pursuers at bay

84 INTERIOR TV CONTROL ROOM

The DIRECTOR BOYS and NORM and SHAKE see GRANDFATHER on the
monitors
They dash out of the room and on to the stage

EXTERIOR STREET OUTSIDE POLICE STATION

PAUL JOHN and GEORGE come running down the street in single file
their knees high in the air they skid to a halt at the police

and without pausing they dash inside After a moment they reappear --
only this time RINGO is behind them They dash off down the street
They are followed at once by ten POLICEMEN also in single file They
are also pounding along knees high in the air The BOYS and the

disappear around the corner At once they reappear from the other
direction then run down the street still followed by the policemen
When they reach the police station another group of police bars their
way so they are forced to run up the stairs and inside

INTERIOR POLICE STATION

The DESK SERGEANT is standing behind his desk looking very surprised
At this moment the boys run in and stand panting in front of the desk
Before the SERGEANT can start speaking the pursuing POLICEMEN arrive
They too are out of breath

SERGEANT
What is all this

JOHN
(heaving and panting)

Hold on until we get our breath

The BOYS and POLICEMEN pant on until JOHN seems to have recovered

SERGEANT
All right now
JOHN
Sure
(to boys)
Ready

The BOYS nod and without further ado they turn and run through the
surprised rank of POLICEMEN and out into the street

EXTERIOR STREET

THE CHASE CARRIES ON
Shots of BOYS being pursued (still in single file) by police

including

HEF

NORM

going

the sergeant with one shot where the BOYS are chasing the POLICEMEN
Finally as they approach the theatre they are seen by the girl fans
who swarm around the police over running them The boys grin to each
other and are about to make off when from their POV we see the
INSPECTOR and POLICEMEN blocking it

JOHN
Ah well it was worth a try

INSPECTOR
(calling to Sergeant)
What do you think youre up to

SERGEANT
Arrest those boys sir

INSPECTOR
Thats all we need to start a real riot
(to Boys)
Come on lads theyre waiting for you

INTERIOR THEATRE BACKSTAGE

The Inspector now hustles the BOYS through the crowds and in through
the main entrance of the theatre where SHAKE and NORM are waiting

looks suspiciously at RINGO who is still wearing his cap RINGO whips
it off and NORM delightedly hugs him The BOYS dash through the stalls
entrance and on stage The DIRECTOR sees them and bursts into tears
with relief NORM hustles the lads into the wings to be changed into
their show costumes All around them last-minute preparations are

on
DIRECTOR
Boys you dont know what this means to me If
you hadnt come back it would have been the

epilogue or the news in Welsh for life

NORM

The DIRECTOR gives NORM a final glare and dashes off

PAUL

The BOYS giggle and slap him on the back
88 INTERIOR TV THEATRE AUDITORIUM

We see the audience of girls streaming in and settling down in their

places for the show There is the usual business of getting the show

ready and we see SHOTS of the girls faces then JOHN PAUL RINGO and

GEORGE looking at them At last on cue from the floor manager the BOYS

start their act to the audiences screams During the number we

constantly CUT away to the audience with various SHOTS of the ecstatic

girls In the middle of these shots we see NORM standing at the side
of

the audience his face glowing with satisfaction We follow his gaze
from NORMS POV we see GRANDFATHER handcuffed to SHAKE but in

of this the old man is enjoying himself The BOYS now perform a

of numbers ie a little of all the songs we have heard during the
story This gives the impression of a full set and we finish after
their bows While they are doing so they look again in the general
direction of SHAKE and GRANDFATHER and from their POV we see SHAKE
is beating time to the music but from his wrist dangles an empty set
handcuffs GRANDFATHER has gone again As the BOYS are reacting to
GRANDFATHERs disappearance once again the trap door on the stage
opens and GRANDFATHER appears in the centre of the group as they

their act and take their final bows

INTERIOR STUDIO CORRIDOR
