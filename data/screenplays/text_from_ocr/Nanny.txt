INT HAVS CONDO - AISHAS ROOM - NIGHT 1

We linger on the face of a jarringly pretty dark skinned
woman AISHA 26 sleeps soundly A halo of water ripples
around her threatening to engulf her

A SPIDER emerging from nowhere ambles across her cheek
Startled Aisha’s doleful griot eyes pop open Her ragged
inhalations straddle fear and the cave mouths of memories as
of yet unseen

INT HARLEM APARTMENT - AISHA’S ROOM - EVENING 2

Aisha buried in a twin sized bed pressed against a wall
glued to her cellphone

We scan her room quaint as to be expected but not without
brush strokes of style Shards of African fabric peek from
nooks A small pile of books nestle in a corner of the room

Pictures encased in baroque frames intimate a life before
this

In one photo Aisha grins happily with a boy in her arms Her
mini me LAMINE

Just outside her door Aisha hears movement She pops her
head out

INT HARLEM APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 3

AUNTY SARAH 55 dressed in nurse scrubs wearily shuffles
towards the door A ragged breath escapes her as though
steeling herself for the long shift ahead

AISHA
Aunty do you need anything

AUNT SARAH
No no just your share for the
month

AISHA
Yes soon I will have it

AUNT SARAH
How is it

AISHA

FYC 3

AUNT SARAH
I pray for you Just work hard to
keep it Jobs like this - they
dont’ fall from the sky

AISHA
Yes Have a good night

AUNT SARAH
Bonsoir chérie

She disappears out the door

INTEXT HAVS CONDO - ENTRANCE - DAY 4

Aisha enters peeling away from the crowd of commuters

INT HAVS CONDO - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS 5

Her gaze lands on a DOOR MAN 31 behind the desk He double
takes standing up instinctively allowing her to take all of
him in--muscly lithe formidable

This man cognizant of his beauty is MALIK fully aware of
his effect on Womenand men He flashes a pearly smile
meant solely for Aisha

She pulls out her passport before he can ask for ID He
studies it

MALIK
I-SHA New Nanny for the HAVS
right You know where you goin’

AISHA
Yes Thank you

Aisha tucks away her passport makes her way to the
elevators

POV OF SECURITY MONITORS Aisha’s pixelated black and white
image enter the elevator
INT HAVS CONDO - ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS 6

Aisha stares at her reflection in the mirrored elevator doors
as she ascends She glides chapstick over her lips
FYC 4

INT HAVS CONDO - CONTINUOUS 7

Elevator doors open into the condo AMY 36 An ageless
beauty belying a tightly wound undercurrent of nerves

AMY
Aisha Welcome

Amy studies Aisha as she takes off her shoes and unloads her
bag

We see the condo in all its glory sterile modern spacious
Lower upper class by New York standards relative wealth by
national standards A pristine box encased in floor to
ceiling windows

Aisha knowingly makes her way to the
KITCHEN SINK

She washes her hands meticulously The women grant each other
tight but warm smiles

AMY (CONTD)
How was the commute

AISHA
Not too bad

AMY
Great

Aisha turns off the faucet and dries her hands

AMY (CONTD)
Thank you

AISHA
YesHow are you

AMY
I’m well but I think Rose is a
little better She’s very excited

AISHA
Aww I am too I am very excited

AMY

Amy presses condo keys into Aisha’s palm Aisha closes her
hand around them
FYC 5

AMY (CONTD)
Now that it’s official let me give
you the full tour

AISHA
Yes
AMY
Excellent Ok follow me

Aisha trails Amy--her eyes swimming with curiosity as she
takes in the impressive space more closely this time

Contemporary Art riddles walls traveling up sky high
ceilings Various exotic house plants sprinkle the clinical
space with life A Bird of Paradise plant sprawls upwards
branches reaching out for dear life among schefflera amate
and monstera plants

The inhabitants of this space are collectors of resplendent
peculiar things

They pass a slightly ajar door

Aisha furtively peeks through the sliver of access A 30x45
FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH of a WAILING AFRICAN WOMAN slumped on her
knees SCREAMS back at Aisha The image is mesmerizing--
whoever exists behind the lens is clearly skilled

Amy closes the door abruptly

AMY (CONTD)
Adam’s office We civilians aren’t
allowed

GUEST BEDROOM
Amy flicks on a light

AMY (CONTD)
And this is yours Nothing fancy

Aisha walks in Quite fancy actually

AMY (CONTD)

For overnights Please please make
this space yours Bring whatever
you need to feel at home pictures
books your favorite pillow Just
one small request no candles or
incense Rose is hyper sensitive to
certain smells

Rose we’re coming in

Amy enters

AMY (CONTD)
Honey Aisha’s here

Aisha peeks in with a smile

ROSE
Hi Aisha

AISHA
Salut petit amour

Amy crouches in front of Rose and takes both of her hands in
hers

AMY
I want you to be a good girl for
mommy
Rose looks to Aisha
ROSE
Ok
INT HAVS CONDO - LIVING ROOM - DAY 9

Amy slides a binder towards Aisha

AMY
Please I don’t want you to feel
overwhelmed Think of this as a
loose guide basic schedule
emergency contacts a list of where
things are

Aisha peruses the meticulous multi tabbed planner

AMY (CONTD)
All phone numbers you’ll ever need
Even her therapistsome blank
pages for you to fill in and make
it yours

Aisha lingers on a tentative schedule with end times “TBD”

FYC
AISHA
Thank you

Amy gathers her belongings willing herself to leave

AMY
Ok

She lingers a beat too long

AMY (CONTD)
Is this weird It’s kinda weird

AISHA

AMY
I mean it’ll be a little bumpy at
the beginning but we’1ll catch our

stride

AISHA
Yes I’m sure

Amy approaches Aisha

AMY
May I

Amy dives in for the embrace wrapping herself around Aisha

Aisha hugs her back

AISHA
Of course

AMY
Thank you

Amy scoops up her bag and blazer and heads out

INT HAVS CONDO - KITCHEN - DAY

A FRIDGE OPENS meticulously organized with labels color
coded stickies--

“gluten free”
fermented kimchee - do not touch

FYC 8

Aisha scans the fridge landing on a pre-packaged meal labeled
“ROSE”

CUT TO

Settled in a kiddie chair with personalized plastic utensils
Rose turns her face defiantly away from an approaching spoon
of organic gluten free slop

ROSE
No

AISHA
Your mommy made this just for you
Dont you want to eat the healthy
food Mommy made

ROSE

ROSE
Je ne veux pas

Aisha holds her hand out for a high five Rose leaps up
eagerly slapping Aisha’s hand

AISHA
Good girl Ok

FYC 9
Aisha looks at the slop braces herself and shoves a
spoonful into her mouth

Fighting her gag reflex she forces a pained smile as she
swallows

AISHA (CONTD)
Mmm Yum

Rose giggles at Aishas pathetic performance Shakes her head
no She watches Aisha unpack her own carefully packaged
lunch rice stew plantains Rose sniffs the air
dramatically She squinches her nose curious

The two are in a stare off Aisha finally relents

She scoops a tiny morsel of jollof rice onto a spoon and
hovers it before Rose who snaps it up like a baby alligator

Roses eyes light up
CUT TO

Rose dances happily She scoops a large spoonful of rice off
Aishas plate into her mouth

Aisha does the same

AISHA (CONTD)
Happy now C’est délicieux

Rose nods

ROSE
Say deli-see-you

AISHA
Your french is so good

Aisha and Rose hi-five

INT HARLEM APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY 11
Aisha puts on makeup as an attempted WhatsApp video call
rings endlessly--just as shes about to give up an image
flashes on the screen

A WOMAN blurry but decipherable Her name we will learn is
MARIATOU She’s approximately Aisha’s age

They alternate between their tribal language and English
FYC 10

MARTATOU
Hello Hello Aisha--

Aisha holds the phone up

AISHA
Yes Mariatou Hello

Jumbled conversation of people in distant lands struggling to
communicate words tumbling on top of each other delayed
seconds of understanding--

AISHA (CONTD)
Can you hear me

MARIATOU
Loud and clear
AISHA
Is Lamine near you
MARIATOU
You know your son is slippery Hold

ON

Aisha waits for what feels like an eternity She watches as
Mariatou scurries off screen then

Aisha’s son LAMINE6 appears in digital flesh Aisha
visibly softens at the sight and sound of him

LAMINE
Hi mamma

AISHA
Lamine my baby Are you being a
good boy Aunty Mariatou tells me

LAMINE

freezes on screen

Aisha stares at Lamines frozen image

AISHA (CONTD)
I don’t know if you hear me but
Ill see you soon my love

EXT HARLEM — BACKYARD - DAY 12

We follow Aisha eyeing the nape of her neck as she saunters
into the bustle She’s dressed in traditional African wear

An AFRICAN WOMAN carrying a brimming pan of food darts past
as Aisha surveys the space

A sign strung on a wall reads “HAPPY 6th BIRTHDAY ROMANO”
Ribbons and balloons hang haphazardly West African music
blares from speakers

Aisha places a carefully wrapped box in a pile of gifts--each
distinct wrapping paper an ode from its gift giver

SALLAY (0S)
AISHA

SALLAY 30 bright eyed with a permanently mischievous grin
bee-lines towards Aisha Her bright red blush matches her
crimson lipstick

AISHA
Sallay As late as I am they’re
still setting up

SALLAY
You know how things go Time is the
white man’s invention
Sallay envelopes Aisha in a warm hug
SALLAY (CONTD)
Besides Sierra Leoneans know how

to party You know
Sallay whisks Aisha away enveloping her in infectious
energy
EXT HARLEM - BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS 13

ROMANO 5 today an effusive child sits at the helm of a
table flanked by COUSINS and FRIENDS

FYC 13
Children wear various superhero party masksstark American
contrasts colliding with continental flair

A multi-tiered cake is placed before Romano aglow with six
candles

Taking in the scene from her perch Aisha smiles to herself
observing the boy’s contagious joy Fire dances in his eyes

Revelry plays in slow motion as the crowd rises in a Happy
Birthday song Some sing the African version

CROWD
Appy birtday to you Appy birtday
to you Everybody like you
Everybody like you
Romano leans in to blow out his candles

Aisha closes her eyes and inhales making a silent wish
alongside the boy

She opens her eyes
In Romano’s place sits another child--Lamine Aisha’s son

Lamine grants Aisha a dazzling smile before blowing out
candles with all his might

Back to reality Aisha watches Romano bounce in his chair

INT HAVS CONDO - DAY 14
Aisha rummages for her cell
She sees a face-time call from AMY on the screen deflating

a bit as she accepts the call Rose glued to her ipad is
lost in her own world

AMY
Hi Girls What are you two up to
AISHA
We’re in the middle of French
lessons
AMY

Did Rose finish her food

AISHA
Every last drop
FYC 14

Off the cell phone screen Aisha extends her pinkie to Rose
who hooks her pinkie finger in Aisha’s promising to keep
their culinary adventure a secret

AMY
Thank god Picky doesn’t even begin
to describe that child’s eating
habits Adam gets here sooner than
expected so I’1l need your help
getting everything together
tomorrow Can’t wait for him to
meet you

AISHA
Looking forward

AMY
Ok see you ladies soon

AISHA
Ok bye bye

Aisha cups her chin momentarily lost elsewhere Rose mirrors
her body language Aisha forces a smile putting a thread of
Roses hair behind her ear

INT HAVS CONDO - LATER 15

Aisha glances at a clock The minute hand ticks 7pm Her
phone is painfully silent

The sound of KEYS JANGLING grants a reprieve Amy barrels
into the apartment

AMY
Sorry I’m late Things got crazy

Aisha flips her work binder open scribbling the date and her
hours 8am-7pm

As bubbly as Aisha can muster--

AISHA
Rose is in bed

AMY
Everything was smooth No tantrums

AISHA
None at all

AMY
You kept all the receipts

FYC

Aisha flips to a nook in the binder with carefully paper-

clipped receipts

AMY (CONTD)
You are amazing

Reciprocal smiles Aisha gathers her belongings

AMY (CONTD)
One more thing Sorry for the last
minute request but can you do an
overnight tomorrow Things will

Aisha hesitates

AISHA
No it was umIt was 150

AMY
Alright have a good night

Aisha leaves

imagery--faces that accompany the voices

calm you down Oh my baby my
little baby who can calm you down

wrapped in an old grocery bag

Aisha eyes her favorite pillow Brings it with her

She grabs a framed image of Kofi sliding the photo from
glass and tucking it into her bag before leaving

various curated portraits of the All American Family Amy
Adam and Rose--poised like artfully designed photos you’d see
in a TIME magazine spread

AISHA (CONTD)
Rose

Two small hands peek out from under the bed Aisha kneels on
the floor beside them and they quickly disappear beneath the
skirted bed

AISHA (CONTD)
I wonder where she is

Aisha lifts the bedskirt revealing a beaming Rose

ROSE
You found me

Rose shimmers out from under the bed in a Pink fluffy dress
and sequined jacket and jumps into Aisha’s arms

AISHA

I did I found you You were under
the bed So smart

INT HAVS CONDO - ROSES ROOM - CONTINUOUS 21

Aisha playfully dumps Rose in her bed and the two sprawl on
their backs alongside each other gleefully exhausted

A KNOCK

Aisha props herself up as Amy enters Amy’s steely expression
expands into a warm smile too quickly

AMY
You two are having fun

Aisha squeezes Roses arm whispers in her ear

AISHA
Go to Mommy

A twitch in Amys saccharine smile as Rose flops back on the
bed passive aggressively

ROSE
I’m tired

Aisha stands making room for Amy to sit beside her daughter
As Amy swaps with Aisha she gently squeezes Aishas hand

Aisha leaves the two catching a fleeting moment of Amy
clinically smelling strands of Roses hair

The Pregnant Latina dangerously pregnant to be engaging in
physical labor vacuums an opulent rug

Our gaze lingers on her a beat too long She looks up
locking eyes with Aisha

Aisha smiles Looks away Shame blooms under her skin--caught
in the act of pity or projection
INT HAVS CONDO - MASTER BEDROOM - EVENING 23

Aisha tries not to look directly at Amys half naked
reflection in a mirror

AMY (0S)
Thank you for picking up the dry
cleaning

AISHA
I didn’t think to bring anything
fancy

AMY

Oh gosh it’s my fault I should
have told you There’s always so
much going on at work now My brain
is in a million different places

Amy balances a glass of red wine in one hand as she slides
her naked body into a dress ina

WALK IN CLOSET OFFSHOOT

Amy is like a moth Frantic Evanescent Perpetually in
multiple places at once

AMY (CONTD)
No worries I have the perfect
dress

Amy explodes from her closet Poised Manicured

She presses a red dress against Aisha’s frame
AMY (CONTD)
I swear this dress was made for

your skin Mahogany red Imperial
red Wine red the whole family

CUT TO

Amy zips Aisha into the dress with finality It clings to her
every curve for dear life--a complimentary second skin

Amy places her hands on Aisha’s hips to turn her around

AMY (CONTD)
Oh wow

AISHA
It’s a little tight

AMY
Oh it’s perfect

The RISING MURMUR of a dinner party well underway SWELLS TO A
CRESCENDO
INT HAVS CONDO - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 24

Shrouded in the shadows lingering in the space where the
living room meets the hallway Aisha takes in the gathering

FOUR HANDSOME COUPLES in their late 30s early 40s
Aisha hones in on the sole Black body in the white space

SANDRA 35 a pretty African American woman framed by a nest
of natural hair

Her ease and grace are palpable She throws her head back in
laughter

Then Amy a little too drunk a little too soon Aisha catches
slivers of their conversation

AMY
When are we getting another book
out of you

SANDRA
Oh honey stay tuned The
apocalypse is not exactly a salve
for my writer’s block
FYC 20
Sandra catches Aisha staring and grants her a genuine smile
Aisha smiles back

At the sound of the elevator opening onto the floor - Amy
hushes the crowd as she heads around the corner towards it

MUFFLED VOICES A sharp conversation discernible in pieces
Aisha’s POV

AMY
Well hello there Nice to see you

Amy is all over ADAM 37 Rugged and weary A bundle of
repressed emotion comforted by a mask of logic He turns away
as Amy kisses him

MAN
Stop Just let me put my shit down

Amy takes a step back and laughs as she sips her wine

MAN (CONTD)
Why are you dressed like that

Amy heads towards their friends

MAN (CONTD)
I’m sorry we haven’t even-

Amy’s FOOTSTEPS inch closer to the group who instinctively
yell-

But it’s just Amy Alone

She strolls to a nearby table and refills her empty wine
glass Moments behind her

Genuine surprise drains his face as he drops his bags taking
in the small crowd

AMY
Surprise

ROSE
Daddy

FYC 21

Rose leaps from Aisha’s arms sprinting to her father The
room buzzes with renewed vigor He immediately wears a mask
of civility belying an impatience reserved for Amy

Adam embraces familiar faces making the rounds He was
missed

Adam hoists Rose in his arms whispering in her ear Rose
giggles as he places her down He reveals a thin hardcover
book brought back from his travels--hands it to Rose She
clutches it tightly

Adam notices Aisha just before a BOB 38 tackles him in a
bear hug Amy looks on with a scowl as Adam effortlessly
charms the room

INT HAVS CONDO - ROSES ROOM - NIGHT 25

Rose is fast asleep clinging to Aisha like a koala Aisha
sits on the edge of her bed painstakingly peeling the girl
off her body without waking her

She still clutches the book Adam gave her Anansi the Spider
A Tale from the Ashanti by Gerald McDermott

Aisha plucks the book from Roses hand She studies it
flipping through its pages

A CORNER OF ROSES ROOM
A SHELF OF TEEMING WITH CHILDREN’S BOOKS FROM AROUND THE
WORLD Aisha’s fingers scan the books She wedges Roses new

book in between books

Nearby her eye catches an ever so slight movement Something
mechanical hiding between stuffed animals

She walks closer to see a NANNY CAM

The head swivels as she moves tracking her Aisha bristles
at the discovery

Adam balances Amy on his lap She’s tipsy and he’s jet-lagged
but catching his second wind

Adam nudges Amy who looks over at Aisha The two engage in a
tension laced whispered exchange

BOB (0S)
Tell me how burning shit down and
looting stores in your own fucking
neighborhood help the cause

Amy smirks and slinks away leaving Aisha to Adam

BOB (CONTD)
This is not a rhetorical question

from fireGIRLS covered in burkas their backs cagily
turned to the camera

Aisha revisits the PHOTOGRAPH of the WAILING AFRICAN WOMAN
slumped on her knees allows her curious gaze to finally
return to Adam

As Adam rifles through his wallet Aisha watches the bills
flit between his fingers She silently counts with him

Satisfied he hands her the small stack of cash along with a
metro card

ADAM
I’m sorry youll have to bear with

Je parle frangais aussi

Aisha suppresses a giggle Adam’s pronunciation is ugly He
smiles able to poke fun at himself

ADAM (CONTD)
Yea ok you can laugh

AISHA
It’s not bad

Aisha’s attention drifts as a photo beckons to Aisha pulling
her by some invisible threadFLAMES dance behind a BLACK
TEENAGER

ADAM
I was just in Lille France they
had an uprising there around police
violence

AISHA
Oh
FYC 24

ADAM
Yea

A building on fire casts an ominous glow on the Black teen’s
face His arms are outstretched God like He’s elevated on a
structure--half his face shrouded in a surgical mask
Protestors gaze up at him

Adam shares Aisha’s fixation

ADAM (CONTD)
Yea that kid had a rare fire in
him Maybe the best public speaker
I ever seen he was like Malcolm xX
They hung on his every word
(beat)
He’s dead now

Unnerved by his matter of factness

AISHA
What happened

Adam shakes his head The weight of seeing too much heavy on
his shoulders

ADAM
They said it was gang related

Aisha returns to the image Struck by its poignancy Struck
that the boy’s extinguished life is now immortalized by the
confines of the photograph They lock eyes long enough for

Aisha to turn away A momentary barely detectable break in

the air

AISHA
I’m going to go to bed now
ADAM
Please go to sleep

Aisha listens to a voicemail from Lamine
LAMINE (0S)

I just called to say goodnight

mama Love you
It’s late in New York but even later in Senegal Aisha takes
a chance pressing the ringing phone to her ear silently
wishing for contact

The phone rings endlessly Aisha gives up

She unpacks her overnight bag sliding Lamines photograph
into the groove of a dresser mirror

CUT TO

Light sleep finally takes its rightful place Aisha’s chest
rises and falls in the darkness--a momentary respite

An other worldly GUTTURAL GROAN resonates growing louder
Aisha opens her eyes She darts up

PITTER PATTER--the scurrying of feet echo just outside her
door

AISHA
(whispering)
Rose

Clammy silence
She pulls her covers to her chest creating a thin wall
Heart rate rising She stares at the door honing in on the

knob

Scrambling for her cell phone Aisha activates the
flashlight pointing it at the door

FYC 26
Just as she’s about to turn the flashlight off the knob
turns--ever so slowly
Aisha sinks into her bed throwing her covers over her head

She pants for some time under the sheets struggling to make
sense of what she’s seeing and hearing

FEET PAD deeper into the room settling just inches from her
Steeling herself she wrenches the sheets off her head--
WATER CASCADES into her room as an INHUMAN MOAN rises to a
piercing crescendo

INT HAVS CONDO - GUEST ROOM - MORNING 30

inspecting for damage it is unfazed

INT AFRICAN HAIR BRAIDING SALON - DAY 33

OVERMODULATED SOUND of a Nollywood movie drones in the
background Exaggerated Nigerian dialects ebb and flow

Sallay returns to her CUSTOMER an annoyed African American
Girl getting individual braids

Aisha settles into a salon chair

The American girl scrolls through her phone She has a small
tuft of hair left to be braided which she touches hopefully

Every time we think the tuft is finally too small to part
Sallay parts another smaller tuft to braid

Sallay and Aisha speak in their native language sprinkled
with English

SALLAY
I was like this girl has forgot
about me No call no text no

I know Nigeria has definitely seen

AISHA

SALLAY
You think maybe if you apologize to
Lamine’s father and his
wifeMaybe they can help you

AISHA
Apologize for what It is him who
should apologize for impregnating
every teen girl on her way to
school He knew he was married when
he paid for my school fees when he
gave me money for food clothes
for my sick mother

Trust me I know how it is Big men
play with little girls and it’s
always the girls who are punished

lives or dies--He’s not met him

Aisha looks on as Adam stands to embrace the woman CHRISTIE
mid 30’s Aisha notes the woman’s effervescent laugh the
glide of Adam’s hand intimately pressed to the woman’s lower
back the kisses on both cheeks that linger dangerously close
to the lips

They talk closely in whispers Eyes locked on one another
Aisha looks away embarrassed for what she’s not sure
Christie squeals at the sight of Rose

She kneels beside the table to speak to her close enough for
Aisha to smell her perfume

Aisha emerges out of a train station slowly tired and spots
Malik a few steps ahead The kind of NYC coincidence that
makes perfect sense

Aisha watches Malik debating He nods to the music in his
headphones She decides against breaking her voyeuristic
perch and quickens her stride to catch up to him

At the site of Aisha a smile spreads wide across his face

Aisha settled on a bench checks her cellphone - multiple
missed calls from Mariatou

She call her back and listens intently--the familiar ring of
an unanswered call--Her ear buds pressed in her ears

REVELERS flit past along the pier

MARIATOU’S VOICE (0S)
Ha just kidding You’ve reached
Mariatou Leave a message after the-

Aisha ends the call She eyes Lamines new coat propped
beside her on the empty bench

She removes her headphones and gazes out at the expanse of
water Barely blinking Aisha appears to be mesmerized by a
nebulous force pulling her attention to the dark murky water

A PIERCING RING fills her ears along with the sound of WOMEN
WAILING--visceral cries of suffering

CLOSE ON dark waves crashing into one another

As she peers into the water she sees a WOMANThe Woman’s
head rises just above the water surrounded by a halo of
thick black hair The Woman’s sclera the whites of her
eyes are as black as her pupils peering through Aisha with
an unnerving gaze

SOUND FILTERS AWAY as Aisha locks eyes with the creature
SUDDENLY A CHILD’S CRY jolts Aisha back to

She exhales unwittingly holding her breath She turns back
to the water and the woman is gone

The boy looks faintly like Lamine
She walks towards him puzzled but mesmerized

Malik appears from no where breaking her trance He scoops
the rambunctious boy in his arms--his son--BISHOP 6

MALIK

Kathleen emerges with a platter of tea anyway

She places it

gingerly before Aisha Aisha takes the offering plucking a

choice from the array
She can’t shake the feeling

I feel like I’ve met you before

It’s very possible

They study each other two formerly acquainted spirits
reunited in this liminal space called life--the present

for 10 years Fell in love with the

vibrance I wish I could bottle and

bravado with a sprinkle of Ghanaian
pride and a heaping serving of
Sierra Leonean humility

We are supposed to make babies to
settle--even for men who don’t want
us but some of us would rather
make ourselves

Kathleen takes Aisha in with an agreeable “hmm”

Aisha’s curiosity moves to a collage painting on vinyl She
approaches the piece--losing herself in the image of a
grotesque but beautiful half woman half fish underwater
creature with bared teeth sharp as nails

The Mer-woman’s claws sink into the head of a limp human
figure succumbing to the creature’s power

Kathleen’s voice cuts through like a salve

KATHLEEN
One of my favorites It’s called
“Killing you softly” by Kenyan

interpretation of Mami Wata La

Mammawhatever name a culture
chooses they are genderless
ancient water gods Some believe
the mermaid lures with sexuality
money and promises of fertility
but they can also be dangerous
unpredictable and impermanent
Enslaved West Africans brought
tales of Mami Wata with them
They’re as unpredictable as the
water that swallowed too many of us
whole--or rather liberated us

Aisha faces Kathleen worry etched in her face

AISHA
I think I saw herthem

KATHLEEN

Aisha nods tears welling in her eyes

Am I losing my mind

transferring strength into her body

Oh no no no dear don’t cry You’re
perfectly fine Mami Wata feeds on
whatever you give--whether it’s
fear or rage or vengeance The
spirits are calling you trying to
communicate something

But why me

Kathleen tilts her head raises her shoulders - her eyes
searching Aisha’s with sympathy and a deep resignation

to survive It’s up to us to answer
the call

asleep in the warm fort Aisha watches her chest rise and
fall

INT HAVS CONDO - EVENING 51

All is quiet as Aisha waits alone in the dark She plays back
the voicemail from Lamine over and over in her head

LAMINE (VO)

AISHA (VO)
It’s true Lamine I love you

LAMINE (VO)

THE ELEVATOR DINGS in the distance Aisha darts up
methodically gathering her belongings

Stands still as she watches Amy’s dark figure stumble into
the condo

Something CLANGS loudly hitting the floor

AMY

AMY

brightness
FYC 56

AISHA
I don’t know where he is I haven’t
seen him today

Amy is visibly drunk She grants Aisha a lipstick smeared
smile as she fumbles with her purse She pulls out a wad of
cash gripping it tightly

AMY
It’s so hard when you’re the Woman
overseeing everything expected to
get drinks with the guys every
Friday to prove I’m one of them
butwe’ll never be one of them
It’s a boy’s club A serious
fucking boy’s club--And when you’re
a Mom on top of that

Amy creeps closer to Aisha Aisha smells wine on her
breath

AMY (CONTD)
Guess who got a promotion

Amy jumps up and down giddy She dances around Aisha to
music only she can hear intertwining her fingers in Aisha’s
as she forces her to sway with her in celebration

Aisha let’s her use her body as a prop until she doesn’t
gently pulling away Amy won’t let her go embracing Aisha
tightly Aisha’s hands hang limply at her sides

The hug lingers uncomfortably long Aisha rips away

AISHA
Enough
AMY
(whispering)

Aren’t you happy for me

AISHA
I need a set schedule I need you
to stick to the times you tell me

Amy’s face contorts Her lip quivers Weaponized tears stream
down her face

presses the balled up bills in Aisha’s hand

AMY

Goodnight Amy
INT HARLEM APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY 52
Wet feet step out of the shower
A hand wipes steam off of a mirror

Aisha stares at her reflection a towel wrapped around her
damp body

Invasive whispers of a woman calling her name forces her to
turn towards the bathroom door away from the mirror

AISHA
Aunty

Her reflection in the mirror--its back still to us--stands
eerily still in spite of Aisha turning to face herself Her
eyes widena twinge of dread plucking at her belly Her
reflection lingers backwards beads of water forming on its
moist shoulders

Aisha retreats as the mirror figure slowly turns to face her
its nebulous features coming into view

Aisha blinks and looks again to see her reflection staring
back at her - all is normal again

INT HAVS CONDO - EVENING 53

As soon as Aisha takes Roses shoes off the girl slips
through her fingers darting into the condo

Aisha runs after Rose but loses her as she disappears into a
nearby room

INT HAVS CONDO - ADAM’S OFFICE - EVENING 54

Aisha pauses at the door’s threshold Light cascades from the

phone call

Aisha knocks

ADAM
Come in

Aisha steps in to see Rose bouncing on her father’s lap
AISHA

She’s tired

ADAM

Rose shakes her head no but her weary eyes betray her
Adam hands Rose to Aisha’s outstretched arms

Adam rifles through paperwork Finds it Hands a white
envelope to Aisha

ADAM (CONTD)

Long-legs reach out from behind a bookshelf 2 legs 4 legs
and finally six legs spider claws climb along the wall
Unwitting to its presence Aisha finally beckons Rose to
sleep Stealing a moment to herself Aisha rifles through the
envelope containing her pay She shakes her head in
disbelief

Her pay is still short

hard to get a hold of

ADAM

Aisha moves food around the plate--her appetite waning She
reveals her work binder Flips to her meticulous note taking
hours of overtime unaccounted for

AISHA

Adam stops eating mid chew

ADAM
Your son

AISHA
His name is Lamine

ADAM

Aisha studies Adam Defiant Fearless
Adam rubs his jaw Thinks

ADAM
Tell you what I’1ll advance you
some of the money until we figure
this out Things have been a little
tightfor everyone

Aisha beams as Adam momentarily disappears She catches her
reflection in a nearby mirror Studies herself

Adam returns with cash
ADAM (CONTD)

I could go to the ATM but this is a
start

FYC 61

Aisha hesitates takes the cash Without thinking she hugs
Adam He hugs her back

AISHA
Thank you Thank you You have no
idea

They part too slowly Adam seizes the opportunity leans in
for a long desired kiss pressing his lips to Aisha’s

Stunned Aisha let’s him for a few seconds but something
overtakes her--

Adam pulls away sharply touching his lip She bit him Hard

ADAM
Shit I guess I deserved that huh
(beat)
You can’t tell Amy about thisthe
money She’s a little too by the
book sometimes Might complicate
things for you

A PHONE RINGS Aisha instinctively checks hers but it’s
Adams He presses the phone to his ear seamlessly falling
into work mode unfazed He sucks the soreness of his bottom
lip

leave
INT HAVS CONDO - MOVING ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS 58

Aisha stares at her reflection Her face fractured by the
elevator mirrors She wipes the residue of guilt off her
mouth

INT YMCA POOL - DAY 59

Swimming lessons for BABIES
FYC 62

Aisha participates hands on She trails through the water
behind Roses SWIMMING TEACHER snaking their way among OTHER
SWIMMERS

Roses small legs kick in and out of the water

Momentarily distracted Aisha drifts away Compelled to be
underwater she sinks lower in the pool until her eyes are
all we see above water

Looking out at the disjointed world fractured by a slice of
water Aisha submerges herself fully-- pushing herself to the
bottom of the pool

827 4262564-

She holds her breath for as long as she can then thrusts
herself up--EXPLODING OUT OF WATER As she sucks in air

She Turns 360 degrees realizing she’s suddenly alone in the
blue water of the pool

A MURKY FIGURE appears behind her Aisha turns to face it
Finally recognizing her in all her glory

MAMI WATA
Closer now

The Mer-Woman’s amphibious EYES kick back light like a
coyote caught in headlights

Aisha closes her eyes wills herself to control her
breathing

She opens them again startled to see a monstrous but eerily
beautiful mirror reflection of herself peering back at her
with those telltale wet alien eyes

She tries to keep one eye on the Mer-Woman’s dark iridescent
tail snaking beneath the water

The mermaid woman leans in closer to Aisha as though she’s
about to kiss her

Unable to move Aisha looks in horror at the nictitating
membrane that flicks across the creature’s eye as it blinks

The Mer-woman wraps her tale around Aisha’s legs SUDDENLY
RIPPING HER BENEATH THE WATER’S SURFACE

Two bodies Intertwined Jolted underwater Descending to the
bottom of a depthless sea the creature’s tail envelopes
Aisha like an anaconda squeezing life from her body

FYC 63

Bubbles rise to the surface as Aisha screams being dragged
deeper and deeper and deeper

QUICK POP

Aisha curled in fetal position in a clawfoot tub
QUICK POP

A full brown stomach marked with the a black line from navel
to vagina--the pregnant belly of a woman half immersed in
water

QUICK POP

A PLUMP BROWN BABY fat wrists and ankles adorned with gold
bracelets that ring out with every jerk of her new movements

The baby yawns and stretches with life
CUT TO

Aisha jolts up from the clammy cement of the poolside
desperately coughing up water A LIFEGUARD leans away from
her His work done He breathes a sigh of relief

Disoriented catching her breath unsure of how much time
passed her searching eyes find Rose shivering under a
strangers towel

INT HARLEM BROWNSTONE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 60

Aisha raises a glass of ice cold water to her lips She
drinks for some time surprised at the magnitude of her own
thirst

Aisha glances at a photograph of MALIK’S MOTHERKATHLEEN’S

AISHA
She was beautiful

KATHLEEN
Losing her almost broke me but I
had to forgive myself I didn’t
fail her The system did She
wasn’t meant to be held down here
She was meant to fly

Kathleen knows Aisha wants more needs to hear more

KATHLEEN (CONTD)
She started threatening to hurt
others herself A manic episode
like I’d never seen I wasn’t so
much scared for myself I was
scared for Malik He was just a
small boy then

Kathleen swallows

KATHLEEN (CONTD)
So I called the police

Aisha’s presence no longer registering Kathleen’s mind slips
into the cave mouths of memory

KATHLEEN (CONTD)
Cops didn’t ask questions didn’t
care Stormed in with their
preconceived notions ready to rage
Slammed Gloria down like a rabid
animal exposed her body
Handcuffed her Started to tase her
so I threw myself between them
Tried to use my body as a shield

As they drove off in that car in

shifted that was never coming back

sleeps deeply her chest rising and falling in the warm
embrace of rest

Aisha turns behind her to see what Rose sees
AMY

Puffy bloodshot eyes Amy’s made up face can’t hide the fact
that she’s been crying

AMY
What are you feeding her

Aisha unable to hide her surprise is momentarily frozen

AISHA
I didn’t know you were here

AMY
That’s not what I asked you Aisha

ROSE
I like it Mommy

Rose innocently holds up a heaping spoonful of rice Amy
snatches the spoon from Roses hand sending rice flying
everywhere

AMY
One of the few times I’m home sick
and I find you feeding my daughter
food that is one way too spicy for
her tummy and two blowing germs on
her food What is in this What if

own kids you can feed them whatever

Instead of saying anything Aisha wrenches open the empty
fridge and yanks out molded blueberries wilted kale a
bottle of Gluten Free Kids Multivitamins
FYC 67

AISHA
Should I feed her this or this or
this

Amy opens her mouth to speak but stops Aisha rifles through
her purse and pulls out a small stack of receipts paper
clipped together

AISHA (CONTD)
Since I started I’ve been buying
her food or giving her some of my
own Didn’t you ever wonder how
your child was eating or you were
too busy to care

Amy crouches down to Roses eye level

AMY
Go pick a book for Mommy to read to
you Any country you want

Rose looks at Aisha for reassurance The sting of this is not
lost on Amy

AISHA
Va dans ta chambre Let Mommy and I
talk

Rose nods scooping up her ipad The women wait for Rose to
disappear

Aisha pulls out her work binder

off but she won’t let go Amy finally wrenches Rose off Aisha
as the child kicks and punches her mother She’s throwing a
full blown tantrum unlike any we’ve seen before Tears stream
down her red face

mysteriously water stained beyond recognition

She stares at the back of Malik’s head then at his still
chest searching for indicators of life

She hovers her hand in front of his mouth as he exhales
feeling his breath on her hand

She turns away from him draped in the relentlessness of
insomnia

She closes her eyes willing sleep
CUT TO

The CREAK of a door Aisha’s eyes dart open unsure of how
long she slept

Aisha stares at Malik’s bedroom entrance fixating on the
doorit doesn’t move

Aisha’s petrified gaze follows the direction of a sick
CRUNCHING SOUND She glides sheets off her body

She makes to scream but can’t muster a sound as a SNAKE COILS
AROUND HER THIGH CURLING BETWEEN HER LEGS as it SHEDS its
SKIN

An aborted gasp dissipates as tears stream down her face

She turns to Malik--reaching A silent plea for help but
stops short

In lieu of Malik’s body is a writhing mass of hair-like
tendrils brimming throbbing The mass gives way to unveil
daddy long leg spiders running over one another--toppling
onto the bed climbing over Aisha’s skin

Aisha kicks at the spiders fighting air as she falls
backwards off the bed

INT HARLEM BROWNSTONE - MALIK’S ROOM - DAY 66

She scrubs marble countertops meticulously

Aisha loads laundry into a drier She lingers before the

strangers’ clothes

INT HAVS CONDO - GUEST ROOM - DAY 69

Aisha falls back on the bed closing her eyes momentarily--
her body salient against white sheets

The ceiling water stain actively snakes its way along the
plaster sprawling outwards like a web Black mold throbs as
a lone spider crawls from the mass ambling its way down the
wall towards Aisha’s sleeping body

The spider creeps over Aisha’s face crawling into Aisha’s
open mouth

neck too tightly Rose clings to her seemingly leaping from

Freshly boiled red lentil pasta trickles into a kiddie bowl

Aisha pours homemade tomato sauce on top of the slimy
fusilli She rubs her temple eyeing Rose sliding back and
forth

Aisha turns her attention to a detailed note clipped to the

on top of the concoction

Steam rises from the slop

Rose turns the volume up even higher

face like viscous blood

Aisha gasps Rose just stares at her

Rose folds her arms defiant

AISHA (CONTD)
Pick it up now I am not your maid

Aisha extends a rag Rose turns her back to Aisha Rage
simmering to the surface Aisha reaches out to grab Rose but
stops herself--hands hovering in a liminal space of
indecision

Aisha scans the space for visible Nanny cams

Weary impatient Aisha takes Roses hand forcing her to
grasp the rag She controls Rose like a puppeteer using her
limbs to manually clean the mess

PROTESTOR surrounding by a halo of fire--his arms

outstretched as though nailed to an invisible cross

An intangible thread pulls her closer to the image

contorted in torment
We hold on the eerie image Fire dances in Aisha’s eyes--
reflected back at her Flames leap from the still image

nightmare

She looks down to see her hand wrapped around the blade of

Surroundings gradually fade into focus Aisha props herself
up--remembering Water overflows onto the bathroom floor
pooling around her feet

Aisha approaches the brimming tub Turns off the water

A crimson viscus of blood at the bottom of the tub catches
Aisha’s eye

An UNSEEN FORCE sucks her into water’s surface thrusting
Aisha’ head beneath the water She screams underwater
sending bubbles rising in a suffocating frenzy

The force yanks her head up allowing her to suck in oxygen

She spots the bloody knife on the floor Grabs it before
being plunged underneath again

Aisha flails raising the knife

MARIATOU (CONTD)
See you soon
INT JFK AIRPORT - MORNING 85
Malik flanks Aisha

She clutches Lamines thick bubble coat lingering at the
gate where Lamine and Mariatou are expected to arrive

She looks on as families greet loved ones with perishable
gifts and nostalgic embraces

She waits
And waits

Malik paces helping her search for Mariatou and Lamine in
the crowd

Finally her gaze lands on a child in the crowd who resembles
Lamine

As she darts through a mass of people dread washes over her
as she realizes it’s not him

She looks on as the boy is scooped away by his mother

Evening turns to night Aisha listens to her call ring
endlessly--

MARIATOU (0S)
Hi how are you

AISHA
Mari--

MARIATOU (0S)

Ha just kidding You’ve reached
Mariatou Leave a message after the-

INT JFK AIRPORT - VARIOUS - DAY 86
Aisha approaches a series of AIRPORT WORKERS She shows them
pictures of Lamine on her phone They all grant her various
renditions of unknowing

INT JFK AIRPORT - CUSTOMS - AFTERNOON 87

Aisha paces as an AIRLINE REPRESENTATIVE types information
into a computer

FYC 81

AIRLINE REPRESENTATIVE
The flight arrived on time Some of
the luggage was delayed so there
might be some stragglers but
everyone was cleared No one was
detained

AISHA
But my son and my cousin were on
the flight

AIRLINE REPRESENTATIVE
Miss there’s not much else I can
do Is there any other family--

Aisha grabs her bag and storms out of the office Malik runs
behind her quietly thanking the representative

EXT JFK AIRPORT - PICKUP - LATER 88

Aisha stares into space Malik beside her unsure of what to
say or do A quiet urge overcomes her

She tries Mariatou again pressing the phone to her ear
Listening

The sound of a phone ringing nearby arrests her attention

Instinctively Aisha stands up floating towards the ring
Eyes searching The distinct ring stops suddenly just as
Mari’s familiar voicemail sings out--

MARIATOU (VO)
Hi how are youHa just kidding
You’ve reached Mariatou Leave a
message

But Aisha has already dropped the phone away from her ear
Eyes widening in disbelief--impossibility roaring through her
mind

Her gaze lands on MARIATOU In the flesh Rueful but real
The woman we’ve come to recognize in Aisha’s phone a chimera
materialized--the very personification of Aisha’s past
colliding with her present

Mariatou is too busy struggling with her oversized suitcase
to notice Aisha breathlessly approaching her She locks eyes
with Aisha just as an Airtrain approaches thrumming closer

Palpable fear etched in Mariatou’s face as she stands to face
Aisha close enough to touch her
FYC 82
AISHA
Where is he

Mariatou tries to back away her gargantuan suitcase impeding
her path

MARTATOU
AishaI

Desperation plucks at both women

AISHA
Mari where is he Where is Lamine

Tears stream down Mariatou’s face Aisha lost in a colorless
rage grabs Mariatou by the collar of her flimsy jacket

MARTATOU
PleaseAishawanted to tell
you

AISHA

WHERE IS HE

Mariatou drops to her knees before Aisha Begging for
forgiveness

MARIATOU
We looked away only for a little
time
QUICK POP
Soundlessness

Aisha pressing BABY Lamines head against her chest
sunlight drenching them in a veil of protection Baby Lamine
coos in response to his mother’s loving touch

QUICK POP

Aisha’s hands loosening their grasp on Mariatou Looking up
The canopy of sky above them staggering

Mariatou Breathless Wet with tears sputtering words

MARIATOU (CONTD)
--when we went to the
Beachwaves were too
strongdidn’t know how to tell
youHe drownedWe looked for
him

QUICK POP

FYC 83

Soundlessness
Bath water trickles from Aisha’s fingertips onto Baby
Lamines glowing face He gifts his mother the most loving of

smiles She kisses his escarpment of cheeks like plots of
land

QUICK POP

Life teeming around her dissipates to noiselessness--Mariatou
seemingly in a faraway place still pleads as Aisha floats
away

A synaptic breach of the soul

Aisha collapses

CUT TO BLACK

INT HARLEM BROWNSTONE - MALIK’S ROOM - DAY 89

Aisha groggily opens her eyes remembering She hears a soft
susurrus of whispers Real or imagined she’s not sure She
drifts back to sleep clutching Lamines winter coat against
her chest

AISHA (PRELAP)
I just need some air

INT HARLEM BROWNSTONE - PARLOR - DAY 90
Aisha drinks tea Puffy mournful eyes betray her attempt at
a consoling smile Kathleen studies her before sharing a

concerned look with Malik

KATHLEEN
What you need is rest

AISHA
After this walk I promise

Aisha places the tea down Malik and Kathleen on her heels as
she makes her way to the door

Malik makes to go with her but Aisha firmly presses her hand
to his chest

AISHA (CONTD)
Please

Malik concedes lingering on brownstone steps Aisha turns
back to grant an affirming smile

Kathleen watches her through glass

EXT HARLEM STREETS - DAY 91

Aisha takes in the air Stares up at sun in the sky

EXT WEST HARLEM PIERS PARK - DAY 92

Bucolic expansive water Lenticular clouds roll through a
blue sky

Aisha eyes closed a backpack strapped to her back steps
off a ledge Her body collides with water fracturing its
surface

Sunlight refracts off bubbles forming just above the water’s
surface as Aisha sinks

INT UNDERWATER -— DAY 93

Aisha descends her hair dancing weightlessly around her
Whispers rise to a crescendo as she looks down into endless
blackness

Something grazes her face She looks up Lamine gazes back at
her hovering above her but beneath the water like an aqua
angel

He extends a small hand She reaches for his hand gripping
it with every fiber of her being She wriggles her body out
of the heavy backpack sending it falling to the water’s
depths

Aisha EXPLODES FROM THE WATERS SURFACE gripping a hand that
belongs to KATHLEEN teeth gritted gripping Aisha by the
skin of her clothes Kathleen struggles with Aisha’s weight

Malik helps guide her drenched body onto land as MEDICS
surround Aisha

KATHLEEN
She’s pregnant please be
careful

momentary joy in their peaceful familial microcosm

QUICK POP

Aisha playing with her and Malik’s newborn daughter

INT HARLEM APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY 94

Swaddled in water’s warm embrace Aisha lies at the bottom of
a clawfoot tub The familiar cocoon of fetal position lulls
her as she closes her eyes Grief held a shape within her
something big and loud and so very insistent finally
dissolving to forgiveness

A nagging ancestral insistence on survival rests in her
curled body

FADE TO BLACK

THE END
