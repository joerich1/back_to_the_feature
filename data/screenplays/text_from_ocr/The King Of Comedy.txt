FADE IN

EXT MIDTOWN MANHATTAN STREETS - DAY

Behind the opening credits we watch a montage of RUPERT
PUPKIN making his daily rounds as a messenger delivering
manila envelopes and packages to various New York offices
always courteous and polite in his demeanor PUPKIN is an
attractive-looking young man just past thirty and dressed
in a stylish blue suit broad tie and wide-collared shirt
His shoes are neatly polished his hair carefully groomed
As the montage continues we see that he has finished his
deliveries and is walking rapidly towards his destination
It turns out to be a television theater north of Times
Square whose marquee announces THE JERRY LANGFORD SHOW

It is dusk and the show is about to break There is a
very small crowd already positioned at the stage door --
a few young girls a few curious passers-by who have
stopped to see who will emerge Three professional
autograph hunters are clustered together

MAE a lady in her sixties wears a red velvet dress a
lace hat and much too much rouge

SIDNEY is in his mid-twenties tall badly-complexioned
slicked hair but otherwise neatly dressed He carries
a brown lunch bag

CELESTE is an enormously fat woman in her mid-thirties
She wears a large cape to conceal her obesity

A middle-aged MAN dressed in a corduroy suit emerges
from the backstage door which is guarded by a large
white-haired POLICEMAN The non-professionals in the
crowd just peer at the MAN but MAE immediately steps in

front of him with her autograph book raised

MAE
(to the MAN)
Are you somebody

MAN
No honey Im just a working stiff

The MAN keep walking and MAE returns to her cohorts
just as PUPKIN arrives

MAE
Hi Rupert

CELESTE
(coolly)
Hello Rupert

SIDNEY
Who did you get

PUPKIN
(distractedly)
Nobody

PUPKIN carefully places himself near the door a step or
two away from the other professionals

MAE
(to SIDNEY)
I got Mr Raf Vallone outside 21

CELESTE
(to SIDNEY about PUPKIN)
Hed never tell you anyway Sidney

MAE
Then I got him again at the
Pierre at four oclock

SIDNEY
Be a dear Mae I dont happen
to have Mr Vallone

MAE
You know what I want for him

SIDNEY
But I have only six Barbras left
You know how difficult she is to
work with

MAE
I dont have her even once

CELESTE
(to MAE)
Maybe Rupert would help you

PUPKIN shoots a hostile glance back at CELESTE

SIDNEY
Would you do that Rupert You dont
feel about Barbra the way I do

MAE
Ill give you Mr Burt Reynolds too
CELESTE
(needling RUPERT)
Look Sidney Rupert doesnt do
that sort of thing

SIDNEY
How about it Rupert Ill give
you whoever you want

SIDNEY starts pulling little white cards out of his paper
bag and reading them off

SIDNEY
Rodney Dangerfield Richard
Harris Liza Minelli and
shes not so easy to work with
either Louise Lasser
CELESTE

Youre wasting your time

PUPKIN has been trying to remain apart from the other
three Finally he turns to SIDNEY

PUPKIN
Look Sidney Im just not
interested This isnt my
whole life you know

CELESTE
Whats that supposed to mean --
that its my whole life or
Sidneys or Maes

MAE
It is so my whole life

CELESTE
Shut up Mae What about your
mother Isnt she part of
your life

MAE
Its her whole life too

The show breaks The doors swing open and people pour out
The crowd around the backstage door swells

POLICEMAN
(to the crowd)
If you want Jerrys autograph give
me your piece of paper and Ill
send it backstage

A number of people in the crowd hand in pieces of paper
PUPKIN is standing next to a young couple about college
age The YOUNG GIRL has just sent in her paper

PUPKIN
(to the GIRL)

What are you going to do with
Jerrys autograph

YOUNG GIRL
I dont know Maybe Ill sell it

BOYFRIEND
Ill tell you what shes going to
do with it Shes going to pin

it on her bulletin board and
have an orgasm

The YOUNG GIRL laughs unself-consciously
CUT TO

LANGFORDs limousine waits directly in front of the stage
door MAE has engaged the CHAUFFEUR who stands at the
door of the car in conversation

CHAUFFEUR
(wearily)
No Mae

MAE
I dont mean now

CHAUFFEUR
No Mae

MAE

The CHAUFFEUR smiling shakes his head

CUT TO
A plain-looking GIRL in a black raincoat and black floppy
hat stands on the street side of the limousine

carefully watching MAE and the CHAUFFEUR talk

cut To
MAE
But Ive never been in one

We hear a cry as a celebrity emerges from the backstage
door MAE turns and goes back towards the door

cut To

The POLICEMAN is handing out the autographs Suddenly
LANGFORD emerges flanked by three PAGES husky young men
in their early twenties dressed in theater uniforms
There is screaming and some yelling of LANGFORDs name
AANGFORD pays no attention Smiling nervously he makes
is way towards the limousine The CHAUFFEUR stands at

he rear of the car holding the door LANGFORD enters

he car and then suddenly springs back The GIRL in the
lack raincoat and black hat has hidden herself in the
ack seat of the limousine The three PAGES who have
lready turned and headed back toward the theater hear
he commotion and swing around The GIRL who we shall
ome to know as MARSHA hides herself in the far end of
the limo so two of the PAGES go around to the far side
of the car and start pulling her out while the third PAGE
moves into the limo from the street side She fights

QatqtMoOoatawe

like a wildcat but the PAGES slowly manage to drag her
out During the struggle LANGFORD stands amid the crowd
a bit shaken PUPKIN stands next to him staring at him
When finally catches LANGFORDs eye PUPKIN smiles
pleasantly

PUPKIN

(to LANGFORD who

barely listens)
How the hell did that girl get in
there Jesus they certainly
dont give you very good protection
do they

LANGFORD says nothing glancing nervously at PUPKIN

PUPKIN
Look at you here Who the hell
is watching you Any one of
these freaks could just walk
right up to you and do whatever
he wants

A couple YOUNG GIRLS are pressing against LANGFORD

FIRST GIRL
Oh Jerry How can we get to
talk to you

PUPKIN
Just a minute This is crazy

PUPKIN straightens up for action

PUPKIN
(yelling at the crowd)
Okay Stand back

PUPKIN wades through the crowd towards the limousine
pushing SIDNEY and MAE among others out of the way
LANGFORD follows in the path PUPKIN is clearing

PUPKIN
Didnt you hear me Come on
people have a heart

The PAGES have succeeded in pulling the GIRL out of the
far door of the limo just as PUPKIN and LANGFORD arrive
at the near door The CHAUFFEUR has been blocked by the
crowd from opening the door so PUPKIN opens it

PUPKIN
Stand back (To LANGFORD) Go ahead
Jerry

LANGFORD slips in quickly He looks up at PUPKIN who is
holding the door smiling pleasantly

LANGFORD
Thanks Thanks very much

PUPKIN stares at LANGFORD for a moment and then slides
into the limo next to him closing the door behind him

2 INT LIMO - NIGHT

PUPKIN
hate to bother you like this Jerry
but could I speak to you for a minute

LANGFORD
d like to but

PUPKIN

to take very long really But I need
your advice

PUPKIN looks down at his hand which has been badly
scratched

PUPKIN
You dont have a handkerchief do you
Jesus these people will kill you for a
cufflink

LANGFORD hands him a monogrammed handkerchief then checks
his watch

PUPKIN
Thanks If you have to be somewhere I
dont mind talking as we drive You can
drop me off anywhere

LANGFORD
Sorry but Ive got a strict rule never to

PUPKIN
I put myself on the line for you Jerry

Reluctantly LANGFORD signals with his head to his
CHAUFFEUR to start moving As the car moves through New
York traffic PUPKIN and LANGFORD talk

PUPKIN
Thanks Jerry Im grateful for this chance
to talk to you I hope Im not boring you
LANGFORD

Ill let you know

PUPKIN
Really Fine Im Rupert Pupkin Jerry
I know that the name itself doesnt mean
very much to you but it means an awful lot
to me believe me Maybe youve seen me

outside your show and wondered who I am
Well right now Im in communications but
by nature Im a stand-up comedian I know
what youre thinking -- oh no Not another
one And I wouldnt take up even one minute
of your time if I wasnt absolutely convinced
of my talent Im really good Jerry

believe me Im dynamite Now youre probably
wondering if Im so good why havent you
caught my act somewhere right

LANGFORD
Well
PUPKIN
Well up to now Ive been biding my time
developing my act slowly and carefully so
that when my big break finally comes Im
ready -- like you were that night Paar got
sick and you sat in for him I was there
that night in the theater That was the
most important night of my life until
tonight of course

PUPKIN fishes a cigarette case out of his jacket pocket
flips it open and offers one to LANGFORD

LANGFORD
No thanks I dont smoke

PUPKIN returns the pack to his pocket

PUPKIN
Me neither I just carry them as a
courtesy How about a cough drop

LANGFORD
(smiling indulgently)
No thanks I dont cough

PUPKIN
I try not to but sometimes you know
Am I making any sense

LANGFORD
(smiling)
Go on

PUPKIN

Well that night you did Paar I walked
out of the theater like I was in a dream
All of a sudden I knew what I wanted

I started catching your guest appearances
on Sullivan and taping them and when you
got your own show it got to be a kind of
regular thing I studied how you built

to your one-liners nice and relaxed like
you were chatting and how you delivered

the jokes without leaning too much on

them without saying heres the punchline
folks And I watched the way you played
off dead audiences how you let those long
silences build until people couldnt

stand it and then the way you got them

off the hook with that slow smile You
were my college of comedy Jerry like

a kind of teacher a friend I know it
sounds crazy but when you watch someone
every night But thats all in the
past What Im trying to say is this

Im ready now Ive finished the course
And Im thinking as we sit here talking
Is this it Is this that one big break
Is it Jerry

There is a long pause

PUPKIN

Jerry
LANGFORD

Look er what was the name
PUPKIN

m Rupert Jerry

LANGFORD

Look Rupert I know what youre saying
But things dont work that way You cant
just walk onto a network show without any
experience Youve got to start at the
bottom

PUPKIN
But thats where I am

LANGFORD
Youve got to work your way up learn your
trade in front of live audiences start
playing the little clubs

PUPKIN
But that can take years Jerry Look at
me Im already 31 years old People my
age are way ahead of me Ive got some
catching up to do and I need your help
What do you say Jerry All Im asking
you to do is listen to my act Thats all
Is that asking too much

LANGFORD
I get calls from agents every day
All they want

PUPKIN
I tried getting an agent I did Jerry
But you know how it is You cant get an
agent unless youre working and you cant
get work unless youve got an agent

or unless you know somebody And the

only person I know is you Jerry

There is a long pause

LANGFORD
Look why dont you call my office

PUPKIN
Could 1 Oh I knew youd say that
Jerry You dont know how many times Ive
had this conversation in my head And this
is the way it always turns out Thats why
I had to sort of invite myself into the car
tonight I know its kind of presumptuous
and I really appreciate the time youve
given me But breaks like this dont just
happen You have to make your own breaks

The limousine starts slowing down as it pulls up before
UN Plaza It stops LANGFORD gets out PUPKIN follows

EXT UN PLAZA APARTMENTS - NIGHT

LANGFORD turn to PUPKIN looking to get rid of him as
cleanly and gracefully as possible LANGFORD extends

his hand PUPKIN goes to shake it but his hand is wrapped
in the handkerchief He extends his left hand LANGFORD

shakes it awkwardly

LANGFORD
Nice meeting you Rupert I hope it all
works out for you

PUPKIN
Thanks Jerry I dont know how to repay
you Ima little short on cash this
evening but if you dont mind some good
hearty food Id be honored to take you
to dinner

LANGFORD
Thanks but some people are waiting for me

PUPKIN
Oh I understand Well then maybe I could

repay you with a joke

LANGFORD is starting to walk into the building
PUPKIN

Wait a minute Hows this The first night
you do your show from the coast you open
this way Good evening ladies and
gentlemen its great to be back here in

Southern California where you can wake up
in the morning and listen to the birds
coughing

LANGFORD
(nodding but unsmiling)
Not bad Maybe

PUPKIN calls after LANGFORD who heads for the entrance
to his building

PUPKIN
Consider it a gift Hey Jerry
How about lunch My treat

LANGFORD
(turning back before
he enters the building)
Call my office

PUPKIN waves with his bandaged hand notices LANGFORDs
handkerchief and unwraps it

PUPKIN

RITA starts laughing again

RITA
Because I thought you were a jerk

PUPKIN

A bull-necked MAN in his early forties enters He waves
a brief hello to RITA as he walks by RITA smiles and
the MAN takes a seat at the far end of the bar

MAN
Rita

RITA
(to PUPKIN)
Excuse me a minute honey

PUPKIN

RITA goes to the far end of the bar and serves the MAN a
beer They chat briefly as PUPKIN watches uneasily
Finally PUPKIN downs his beer and raises his glass

PUPKIN
Miss Miss

The MAN gets RITAs attention for PUPKIN RITA returns
to PUPKIN and serves him another beer
PUPKIN

The MAN at the end of the bar raises his glass

RITA goes to the far end of the bar She pours him another
beer and settles against the bar resuming her chat with

raises his glass

PUPKIN

RITA

RITA leaves PUPKIN and returns to the far end of the bar
where she once again resumes talking with the MAN PUPKIN
sits for a moment gets up slowly and heads for the john
11 INT THE JOHN - NIGHT

He enters the john and goes to the farthest of the three
urinals A moment later the MAN enters He goes to the
nearest of the three urinals The two men stare at the
wall before them but the obvious tension between them
renders them both incapable of relieving themselves
PUPKIN glances over at the MANs face then immediately
turns back to the wall as the MAN turns to look at him
The MAN glances quickly at PUPKIN and then returns to
staring at the wall PUPKIN sneaks a furtive glance at
the MANs penis The MAN sneaks a furtive glance at
PUPKINs penis

CUT TO
12 INT THE BAR - NIGHT

PUPKIN emerges from the john followed a moment later by
the MAN They resume their seats at each end of the bar

A third MAN has come in and is seated midway between PUPKIN
and the MAN

PUPKIN
Miss

RITA walks over reluctantly

PUPKIN
Listen to me for a second

RITA
I have work to do Rupert

PUPKIN
Just listen Im at the start of
something really big I dont want
to talk about it here but its going
to happen soon and its going to be
great -- for both of us

RITA

No kidding

PUPKIN

So see that guy some other night

MAN
Rita

RITA turns to go
PUPKIN
But I havent finished

RITA returns to the MAN and pours him another beer PUPKIN
sits for a few moments then downs his beer quickly Again
he raises his glass

PUPKIN
Miss Miss

The MAN leans over the bar and tells RITA something She
opens a bottle of beer and hands it to the MAN who slides
it down the bar towards PUPKIN As the beer reaches the
middle of the bar the THIRD MAN seated midway between
PUPKIN and the MAN raises his beer glass to take a sip just
as the sliding beer bottle passes under his hand The
bottle stops right in front of PUPKIN who takes it and
slides it back with equal force At this moment the THIRD
MAN in the middle has finished his sip and has just placed
the THIRD MANs glass on the counter The beer bottle
collides with the THIRD MANs glass creating a mess RITA
glares at PUPKIN as does the THIRD MAN PUPKIN shrugs an
apology and RITA cleans up the mess

RITA
(to the THIRD MAN)
Ill get you another one

As RITA cleans up the mess and pours a fresh beer the MAN
walks down the bar towards PUPKIN He leans over him and
puts a supposedly friendly paw on his shoulder PUPKIN
glances distastefully at the MANs hand on him

MAN
(to PUPKIN)
Look friend Im trying to have a
nice civilized conversation with the
young lady Be a good little lad
huh and give us a break

PUPKIN looks up at the MAN who pats him on the back in a
gesture of fraudulent friendship and menace PUPKIN burps
With an effort the MAN controls his temper and returns to
his seat at the end of the bar PUPKIN instantly raises
his glass

PUPKIN
Miss Miss

The MAN advances towards PUPKIN with another bottle of
beer PUPKIN watches passively as the MAN pours half the
bottle into PUPKINs breast pocket and slams the half-empty
bottle on the counter The MAN walks down to the end of
the counter where a smiling RITA is waiting

PUPKIN again gulps his beer down RITA and the MAN stare
at PUPKIN expecting him to raise his glass and call for
another beer PUPKIN just sits there After a few
moments RITA and the MAN resume their conversation but
they keep glancing over at PUPKIN expecting him to
interrupt them with a call for beer at any moment PUPKIN
continues to sit there Just as RITA and the MAN have
settled back into their conversation PUPKIN falls like a
stone from the barstool onto the floor He lies
motionless RITA and the MAN look at PUPKIN for a moment
while the handful of other patrons glance at him and return
to their drinks RITA leaves the bar and goes to the rear
of the restaurant disappearing into the kitchen As she
does the MAN walks over to where PUPKIN is lying inert
and prods him cruelly with his foot

MAN
Cmon schmuck wake up so I can
kick your ass outta here

The MAN turns to the kitchen to see if RITA is returning
As he does PUPKIN carefully opens one eye grabs a free
chair from a nearby cocktail table rises and bangs the MAN
smartly over the head The MAN falls out cold PUPKIN
straightens up quickly as the other patrons look on with
interest PUPKIN brushes off his suit which is blue just
like the MANs and stands above the MAN just as the MAN
stood above him his back to kitchen RITA emerges from

the kitchen with the owner MR NICHOLS and a large black
COOK

RITA
(to NICHOLS)
He was making trouble one minute
and the next he was on the floor

RITA automatically reaches out as she talks for what she

thinks is the MANs arm Instead PUPKIN turns around
smiling leaving her too startled to speak NICHOLS and
the COOK lift the MAN to his feet

COOK
Okay buddy here we go

NICHOLS and the COOK lead the MAN who is still groggy
of the bar as RITA continues to stare at PUPKIN with a
mixture of curiosity and amusement

RITA
Okay Tarzan Where do we eat tonight

CuT TO
INT CHINESE RESTAURANT ON UPPER WEST SIDE - NIGHT

We are in the kitchen watching two dishes being chopped
shredded and boiled in deep fat The activity is frantic
WE FOLLOW the two dishes as a WAITER carries them from the
kitchen to a booth where PUPKIN and RITA are talking It
is a painfully plain restaurant shaped in a rectangle
with booths lining either side and a row of little tables
in between At the back is the kitchen and two phone
booths facing each other An old Chinese WOMAN mans the
cash register by the door The WAITER sets the dishes down
before RITA and PUPKIN and clears an enormous plate of
spare rib bones from RITAs place RITA hands the WAITER
her empty cocktail glass RITA and PUPKIN are facing one
another

beer to her and drinks it as a kind of toast RITA

keeping the book open his finger pointing under a name
he turns the book to RITA

RITA starts flipping through the book curious about the

pay the price All it takes is a
little talent and sacrifice and the
right break If youve got a friend
in the right place thats all it
takes And thats exactly what I
have going for me right now After
all crazier things have happened

RITA listens silently for a moment then begins to giggle
As PUPKIN resumes speaking we CUT between RITA and the
YOUNG MAN Their flirtation picks up steam The YOUNG MAN
raises his eyebrows as if to ask Are you interested in
me She smiles All the while PUPKIN rattles on

PUPKIN
You just dont realize what a shot on
the Langford Show can mean Thats
coast to coast national TV a bigger
audience than the greatest comedians
used to play to in a lifetime A shot
like that means a free ticket on the
comedy circuit -- Flip Wilson one week
Cosby the next then Sonny and Cher or
Carol Burnett And youve always got
those other talk shows to fall back on
-- Carson Griffin And all that leads
straight in one direction Rita --
Hollywood Thats when we really start

living How does this sound to you --
a beach house in Malibu right on the
ocean Youll get a beautiful tan
believe me And wed keep a suite at
the Sherry Thats the only place to
stay when youre big We could get
something on a top floor and look down
on all our old friends in Clifton and
just laugh How does that sound to you

RITA
It sounds wonderful Rupert and I
really hope you get what you want
But its getting late and Im a working
girl You know what I mean

The telephone at the back of the restaurant starts ringing
A WAITER in the background moves slowly to answer it

PUPKIN

You going to spend the rest of your

life in that place Is that what you
really want talking about nothing with
nothings I thought you wanted something
a little better than that and thats what
Im offering Every King needs a Queen
Rita I want you to be mine What do

you say

RITA
You really want to help me out You
see this (She points to her lower

back molar) A hundred seventy-five
bucks If you could spare fifty say

three people really happy -- me my
landlord and my dentist

During RITAs speech the WAITER has been working his way

In the following montage we hear in the background the
replay of his testing testing testing and various

other noises -- a bit of his voice taped a burst of
laughter the squeal of a tape recorder sent fast-forward
a sudden burst of applause a scrap of theme music At the
same time the CAMERA PANS about the room We look

at the collages which include all the obvious show business
figures with a heavy emphasis on comedians from Chaplin
and Keaton to Sid Caesar and Woody Allen The collages
also include such varied figures as Jimmy Carter Julia
Childs Tom Seaver David Brinkley Muhammad Ali Clifford
Irving Walter Cronkite and Mark Spitz There is a special

Kennedy section -- John F and Bobby framed in black
Jackie in mourning and a picture of Teddy There is also a
trio of assassins -- Sirhan Oswald and James Earl Ray

There is also a talk show collage with a photo of Langford
in the center like a sun surrounded by Snyder Walters
Carson and Griffin One bookshelf holds a veritable
library of comedy -- joke books biographies of comedians
treasuries of American humor Another shelf holds scores
of tapes in their own little boxes each one neatly marked

PUPKIN sitting before the tape recorder lost in thought
Finally he starts the larger recorder and lifts the mike

PUPKIN
First Miss Long Thanks very much
for your help at the office and for
passing this along to Jerry I
appreciate it more than you know

PUPKIN stops the tape recorder and thinks again for a few
beats He then starts the large recorder

PUPKIN
Now Jerry Before I begin I just
want to thank you for listening to
this material and for the opportunity
that youve given me You know lots
of people think that guys like you
you know people who have made it
lose their feeling for struggling

young talent such as myself But

now I know from experience that those
people are just cynics embittered

by their own failure I know Jerry
that youre as human as the rest of us
if not more so (pause) Oh well I
guess theres no point going on about
it You know how I feel So lets get
on with the show The best of Rupert
Pupkin Ive sketched out this little
introduction in order to save you a
little time So close your eyes and
imagine its exactly six oclock
Youre standing in the wings and we
hear Rick Ross and the Orchestra strike
up your theme song

PUPKIN pushes a button on the cassette and we hear the
theme song of the Jerry Langford Show followed by the
voice of BERT CANTER the announcer

PUPKIN deftly shuts off the cassette and substitutes his
own voice for that of CANTERs The large tape recorder
keeps rolling

his television debut Rupert Pupkin the
King of Comedy

PUPKIN rapidly races the cassette tape forward then pushes
down the play button We hear a burst of thundering
applause PUPKIN lets the applause run for a while and
then shuts it off The large recorder keeps rolling

PUPKIN
Now you come on Jerry and do your
monologue Then when the time comes
this is how I see you introducing me
Youll say something like this
Ladies and Gentlemen were going to
do something a little bit different
tonight It isnt often that you can
call someone a sure thing in the
entertainment business After all
the verdict is always in your hands
But I think after youve met my next
guest that youll agree with me that
hes destined for greatness So
now will you please give your warmest
welcome to the newest King of Comedy
Rupert Pupkin

PUPKIN pushes the cassette and we hear another enormous
burst of applause PUPKIN lets it run listening intently

familiar television celebrities) and PUPKIN and RITA are
just finishing a lavish lunch on the patio A pair of
SERVANTS are clearing the table and serving the coffee and
desert as the scene unfolds As we arrive we hear a loud
burst of laughter PUPKIN is regaling the COMPANY with

stories

PUPKIN
Oh you have no idea how bad its
gotten in New York Now the muggers
are so efficient that each time
they jump you they take your name
and address and put you on a mailing
list (the COMPANY chuckles) And
once youre on the list youre in
real trouble like this friend of
mine who was mugged thirty-two times
on his way home from work (a little
laughter from the COMPANY)

A SERVANT places the desert a little elegant tart in
front of PUPKIN and RITA

PUPKIN
(to SERVANT)
Thanks
The SERVANT smiles As PUPKIN continues his story he
glances occasionally at RITA who has begun to nibble at her
tart PUPKIN also glances conspiratorially at LANGFORD

who smiles back

PUPKIN
So what my friend does is get himself
a dog one of those huge German
Shepherds One night hes walking
the dog in Central Park when he hears
this voice behind him (in a German
accent) Okay Harry drop your
vallet and keep your hantz over your
head or I bite your little fanny off

The COMPANY breaks up

ONE GUEST
(to LANGFORD)
Looks like youve found yourself a
winner Jerry

Hes the one who found himself
a winner

RITA looks up smiles and blushes The rest of the COMPANY
smiles benignly and grows attentive as RITA returns to
eating her tart Suddenly she bites down on something
hard She fishes it out of her mouth and looks at it The
COMPANY giggles It is the ring PUPKIN purchased at
Cartiers The COMPANY applauds lightly and laughs
LANGFORD lifts his wine glass

AUDIENCE grows quiet

OFFICIAL
We are met here in these extraordinary
circumstances to join this man and this
woman in holy wedlock But before we
begin let me voice a personal word
of thanks to you Rupert and to you
Rita for choosing me to perform this
prestigious ceremony Because we are
on prime time I am going to discard
my customary remarks in favor of a
few personal reflections When I was
principal at Clifton High and these
two were students I had very little
faith that Rupert here would amount
to very much But like his teachers
and his fellow students I underestimated
this fine young man Some say that
this misjudgment is directly tied to my
recent dismissal as head of the Clifton
School System But let me take this
opportunity to set the record straight
Knowing that Rupert and Rita here were

most certainly destined for a great
career and a lifetime of happiness
I voluntarily stepped down I would
only here add my own wishes to those
of millions of viewers for their
continued health wealth and
boundless success
The OFFICIAL looks quickly past RITA and PUPKIN

Well be back to marry them in a minute

JONNO

CUT TO
70 INT LANGFORDS LIVING ROOM - DAY
It is a handsomely furnished room done in old American

antiques and other tasteful pieces There is a grand piano
heavy with pictures in one corner and wall-to-wall
bookshelves that are mostly full and mixed with a balance
of classics and modern popular reading The whole room
marks LANGFORD as a man of discernment The shelves also
house a fine stereo and a small discreet bar RITA and
PUPKIN walk in like strangers in paradise awed by the
obvious elegance and expense the room reflects

PUPKIN
(as though he owned it)
How do you like it

RITA
(admiringly)
I could live here

PUPKIN
(smiling proudly)
Its the only way to live

RITA stands in the center of the room ill at ease while
PUPKIN strolls about comfortably picking up an ashtray
here a cigarette case there inspecting the artifacts for
inscriptions clues hints about LANGFORDs character and
life

RITA
How come he isnt here

PUPKIN
You heard the guy Hes out playing
golf

RITA

Didnt you tell him when wed get here

PUPKIN continues to move about the room fielding RITAs
suspicious inquiries effortlessly

PUPKIN
We didnt have time to iron out the
details Now just relax Were
the first guests thats all

RITA
(interrupting)
That Jonno character hadnt even
heard of us

PUPKIN
(a little irritated)
It probably slipped Jerrys mind
He has better things to think about
than what he tells his houseboy

RITA
Its just not time way I expected it
thats all
There is a pause PUPKIN continues his investigation He

has moved to the grand piano in the rear of the room

RITA
What do we do now

PUPKIN is looking at a picture of an American Gothic couple
standing in front of a wood-frame house As he comments on
the pictures the CAMERA PANS over them They form a kind

of slide-show of LANGFORDs life

PUPKIN
These are Jerrys parents His father
runs the Post office in Wolverine --
thats in North Dakota

PUPKIN then fixes on a picture of an eleven-year-old boy
standing next to a puppet stage with a puppet (obviously
held by the boy) staring at its master

PUPKIN
This one was in Newsweek He started
giving these puppet shows when he was
still in grade school

WE SEE a picture of a very young LANGFORD seated before a
microphone with some celebrity

PUPKIN

RITA hands him a towel

RITA

RITA
Now for something that smells nice

She swings open the cabinet with a flourish The door
swings open violently and the mirror shatters against
something as pills and bottles tumble into the sink
PUPKIN and RITA stand there staring at each other RITA
begins to laugh but her laugh is cut short by the slam of
the downstairs door

CUT TO
INT THE FOYER

LANGFORD has entered drawn and businesslike JONNO and
the COOK have moved out to greet him

LANGFORD
(looking around)

JONNO

I was going to call the police but

We hear some whispers and scuffling at the top of the
stairs LANGFORD JONNO and the COOK look up PUPKIN

comes bounding down the stairs jauntily with RITA following
cautiously behind PUPKIN has large traces of shaving

cream behind his ears and on his neck

PUPKIN
Hi Jerry We were just freshening up

PUPKIN stops at the base of the stairs turns around and
waves RITA down

PUPKIN
(to RITA)
Come on Rita No need to be shy

PUPKIN smiles conspiratorially at LANGFORD RITA comes
slowly down

PUPKIN
Jerry Id like you to meet Rita
Keane Rita say hello to Jerry

RITA
(tentatively)
Pleased to meet you

LANGFORD nods imperceptibly his face tense his eyes
alert RITA reading her frigid reception looks to
PUPKIN who walks blithely past LANGFORD into the living
room toward the bar

PUPKIN
Whats your pleasure

PUPKIN glances at the small mess he has left on the bar and
turns back to LANGFORD who has moved into the living room
with JONNO and the COOK a few steps behind PUPKIN flashes
LANGFORD an apologetic smile

PUPKIN
(to LANGFORD)
Weve already taken the liberty so
to speak Rita was a little nervous
It isnt every day she meets someone

LANGFORD
Whats going on here

PUPKIN
Weve been sitting around waiting

PUPKIN

what PUPKIN said)

PUPKIN

(backing off)
But we dont mind waiting do we

Rita

RITA says nothing She has sensed something terribly
wrong and is slowly backing away from PUPKIN

You know I
both of you

LANGFORD

PUPKIN

(seizing the idea)
You know you could And thered be
absolutely no way we could prove we
belonged here I never thought of that

LANGFORD

Well you should have before you

PUPKIN

(still fixed on the idea)
Maybe we could work up a routine

about that

LANGFORD

LANGFORD

(exasperated)

JONNO goes back into the foyer followed by the COOK

LANGFORD

PUPKIN
Look Jerry if Ive said anything

the afternoon to yourself
LANGFORD
Ive told you just as clearly as I
can I want you out of here and I

RITA deftly pockets the enamel box

PUPKIN
But what about my material When

RITA
Come on Rupert the man wants us

PUPKIN

Tell her shes wrong Jerry

RITA
Look Mr Langford I didnt know

PUPKIN

RITA
So if theres anything I can do any
way I can make this up to you

PUPKIN

LANGFORD starts herding RITA and PUPKIN towards the door

LANGFORD
Come on Lets go

PUPKIN
All Im asking is fifteen minutes
Thats all Just long enough to
listen to my act Is that asking
too much -- fifteen minutes of your
day against my whole life

LANGFORD

LANGFORD realizes he is being hard He stops for a moment

LANGFORD
I have my own life thats all

PUPKIN
But what about me Jerry What about
my life I made plans -- based on

what you said You cant just turn
your back on me

LANGFORD
Im not telling you again

There is a long pause as the truth finally sinks in PUPKIN
just stares at LANGFORD with disbelief that turns to anger

PUPKIN
So this is the way it works when
youre big huh You just play with
people Is that part of the kick
Jerry (pause) I can see I was all
wrong about you All wrong

RITA starts tugging at PUPKIN

RITA

CUT TO
98 INT MARSHAS APARTMENT - DAY

LANGFORD is seated on a chair whose back is pressed right
up against the high ornate brass bedstead at the foot of
the bed MARSHA trains the gun on LANGFORD now PUPKIN

is unpacking a suitcase He takes out a handsome blue suit
ruffled shirt a bow tie black shoes underwear socks
shaving equipment soap a hairbrush a clothesbrush a
small shoe shine kit aftershave lotion deodorant and a
dozen or so rolls of inch-and-a-half wide adhesive tape

He removes this stuff from a suitcase that is barely big
enough to hold it -- so the mere packing of all this para-
phernalia into such a small space represents something of an
achievement As he takes the stuff out he talks to
LANGFORD his back turned to him

PUPKIN
This wasnt an easy decision for
me Jerry believe me For one
thing I knew it meant we could never
be friends again and that hurt me
Its hard to lose a friend even one
who has let you down You always
hope you can patch things up You
know a guy like me doesnt make
friends that easily

PUPKIN pauses a moment then turns to LANGFORD his voice
filled with emotion

PUPKIN
Why didnt you just listen to the
tape when I asked you Then I
wouldnt have to be doing all this
Was it really too much to expect --
a few minutes of your time to listen
to something Id worked on my whole
life

LANGFORDs eyes shift rapidly He is obviously calculating
how to deal with PUPKIN

LANGFORD
(with disarming charm)
Hey if thats whats bothering you
lets go over to my office and listen
to that tape right now

PUPKIN
Are you crazy Jerry Do you know
what would happen to me

MARSHA listens to this exchange a bit nervously Gesturing
to her gun she says

MARSHA
Am I going to have to hold this
thing all day

PUPKIN sees she has lowered it practically to her side

PUPKIN

(to MARSHA)
Just keep it on him (to LANGFORD)
You know Jerry Friendship is a two-
way street All that time I was
worrying about you and your ratings
and everything you couldnt have
cared less about me

LANGFORD thinks rapidly for a beat or two

LANGFORD
Youre right You know that I
was thoughtless Its just that
when youre doing a big show its
hard to tell who your friends really
are I was wrong I apologize
Why dont we just shake hands and
forget the whole thing
PUPKIN
(suspiciously)
Thats easy to say Jerry

LANGFORD
But I mean it Ill tell them that
the whole thing was a joke and then
we can go to my office and listen to
that tape Come on What do you say

LANGFORD rises with his hand extended toward PUPKIN
MARSHA
(to LANGFORD sharply)
Sit down
LANGFORD looks to PUPKIN

MARSHA
I said sit

LANGFORD reluctantly sits down

PUPKIN
(to MARSHA)
Whats the matter You heard

what he said

MARSHA
All of a sudden with a gun on him
he wants to make up and be friends
And once hes out the door what
happens then

PUPKIN
What happens then Jerry

MARSHA
You get to his office and they
jump you thats what happens Rupert

PUPKIN

MARSHA

PUPKIN

LANGFORD

enough isnt it

PUPKIN stares at LANGFORD for a few beats Then he shakes
his head sadly and says in a very quiet discouraged voice

PUPKIN
No Jerry Its not (to MARSHA)
Keep the gun up

PUPKIN comes over to LANGFORD with a few rolls of adhesive
tape in his hand

PUPKIN
Im sorry to do it this way Jerry
but Im no good at knots Just put
your arms up and out okay

LANGFORD spreads his arms back against the brass bedstead
As PUPKIN goes to tape them LANGFORD tries to grab him
but with sudden demonic force PUPKIN pins him against
the bedstead They are practically nose to nose

PUPKIN
Oh no Jerry None of that Now

Good evening ladies and gentlemen
Thank you Thank you very much I

in Central Park by the network firing
squad so therell be no sensational
Randall monologue this evening

bit different this evening -- a lot
different if you ask me Were going
to give you a glimpse into the future
It isnt often that you can call
someone a sure thing in the entertainment
business After all the verdict is
always in your hands But I think

destined for greatness -- in one way
or another So will you please give

PUPKIN
Good evening ladies and gentleman
Let me introduce myself My name is
Rupert Pupkin I was born in Clifton
New Jersey which was not at that
time a federal offense (laughter)
Is there anyone here from Clifton
(silence) Good We can all relax
Now Id like to begin by saying that
my parents were too poor to afford me
a childhood but the fact is nobody is
allowed to be really poor in Clifton
Once you fall below eleven thousand
youre exiled to Passaic My parents
did in fact put down the first two
payments on my childhood Then they
tried to return me to the hospital
as defective But like everyone else
I grew up in large part thanks to my
mother If she was only here today
Id say Hey mom What are you
doing here Youve been dead for
nine years (laughter) You should
have seen my mother She was wonderful
-- blonde beautiful intelligent
alcoholic (laughter) We used to
drink milk together after school
Mine was homogenized Hers was loaded
(laughter) Once she was picked up for
speeding They clocked her doing fifty
-- in our garage (laughter) When
hey tested her they found that her
lcohol was two per cent blood They
ook away her license and she died
hortly afterwards We used to joke
ogether Mom and me until the tears
ould stream down her face and shed

eadodod

throw up (laughter) And who would
clean it up Not Dad He was too

busy down at OGradys throwing up on
his own In fact until I was sixteen
I thought throwing up was a sign of
maturity While the other kids were

off in the woods sneaking cigarettes I
was hiding behind the house with my
fingers down my throat (laughter)

I never got anywhere until one day
my father caught me Just as he was
giving me a final kick in the stomach

for luck

I managed to heave all

over his new shoes Thats it

I thought

Ive made it Im

finally a man (laughter) As it
turned out that was the only time my
father ever paid any real attention
to me He was usually too busy out

in the park playing ball with my
sister Rose And today thanks to

those many

hours of practice my

sister Rose has grown into a fine man

(laughter)
interested
exercise I
other kids
to beat me

Me I wasnt especially
in athletics The only
ever got was when the

picked on me They used
up once a week usually

Tuesday After a while the school
worked it into the curriculum And
if you knocked me out you got extra
credit (laughter) Except there was
this one kid who was afraid of me I
kept telling him Hit me Hit me

Whats the

matter with you Dont you

want graduate As for me I was

the only k

id in the history of the

school to graduate in traction The
