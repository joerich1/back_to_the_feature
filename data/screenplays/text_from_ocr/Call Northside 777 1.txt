STOCK SHOTS - CHICAGO FIRE - (FROM OLD CHICAGO)

Over these SHOTS comes the VOICE of the narrator

NARRATORS VOICE
In the year 1871 a cow kicked over
and lamp and started the great fire
that destroyed Chicago But out
of the ashes of that catastrophe
sprang a new Chicago --

STOCK SHOTS - CHICAGO SKY LINE - SKYSCRAPERS -
FACTORIES - ETC

Over the SHOT comes the narrators VOICE

NARRATORS VOICE
-- a Chicago of brick and brawn
conerete and guts with a short
history of violence beating in its
pulse

SHOTS OF CHICAGO NEWSPAPER BUILDINGS

NARRATORS VOICE
That history is on the record and
that record is kept by the news-
papermen who have made Chicagos
papers great

SHOTS OF CHICAGO IN LATE 1932

These include shots of typical scenes in that period
gangland warefare scenes interspersed with shots of
flop-houses men gathered outside employment agencies
and men sleeping under newspaperson park benches

and perhaps a shot of someone selling apples on a

street corner - in all of them the characteristically
brutal gusts of wind for which Chicago is known The

narrators VOICE continues

NARRATORS VOICE
No period in Chicagos history was
more violent than the years of the
depression The rise and fall of
the bootlegging empires was written
in blood and bullets In 1932 -
there were 365 murders in Chicago -
one for each day of the year - eight
policemen were shot down in the line
of duty One of the most cold-blooded
-of these murders occurred on
December 9th 1932 on South Ashland
Avenue in a place operated by a
woman named Wanda Skutnike vs

(NOTE The above is broken to cover the above-mentioned
SHOTS and atmospheric SHOTS of southside speakeasiess

We are CLOSE on a sign on the window which reads

WANDA SKUTNIK

CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see it is a bitterly cold
windy day Passersby are muffled in their overcoats
and braced into the stiff wind Traces of snow are
seen swirling on doorsteps and at the curb A wagon
is stopping the horses head is lowered in the sharp
cold wind It is loaded with sacks of coal On its
side is lettered

Along one side runs a makeshift bar In bg empty
barrels and bottles In the center of the room is a
rough deal table and in the back there fs a pot-

‘bellied stove with a wood and coal box beside it At

the center table BORIS a big burly gorilla of a man
with huge black mustachios is finishing his drink

“WANDA SKUTNEIK the proprietress a once attractive but”

now blowsy woman of about thirty-five or six is near

and Gruska comes in carrying a bag of coal He dumps
the coal into the box near the potbellied stove stamps
his feet and turns to look at Wanda

GRUSKA

Wanda looks at him wryly - produces a bottle and glass
and brings them over to the table

“WANDA

Gruska grins sits down and starts pouring a drink

He nods at Boris who nods back quistly and rises

Boris goes out the alley door and Wanda walks over to
the icebox and takes out of it a amall vaper bag in
which she keeps her money She takes a bill out of it
and goes toward Gruska Off scene we hear the SOUND

of the ‘front door BELL

WANDA -

Thats all right Pay me next time

W BUNDY enters Hes a big man grey at the temples
and hes now beating his hands together to restore
circulation

BUNDY
Wanda youre looking at a man with
a cold coming on

Bundy walks to the potbellied stove Wanda picks up
the bottle and a glass pours some in as she approaches
Bundy and hands him the drink as he sits down before
the fire

WANDA
For a cold - this is good

BUNDY
Thanks

Gruska remains seated at the table Bundy is now fac-

ing the stove with his back to the door leading to the
“store Outside we HEAR the store door open and the

BELL ring Wanda who has just turned around after
handing the drink to Bundy is facing the glass parti-
tion in the door that leads to the store

‘MED FULL SHOT - ANGLING PAST WANDA AS SHE LOOKS TOWARD

THE FRONT OF THE STORE

the daylighted windows of the store They are big and
menacing but we cannot see their faces or distinguish
anything about » them

The swinging door is thrust open and we see the lower
half of the two men - and now their guns are visible
Wanda still does nét see them distinctly but she gasps
in fear when she sees the guns She quickly dashes

into the closet One of the men starts toward the ice-
box to get the money Then together both men are

aware of the blue-coated figure of Bundy just as he
turns around Gruske flings himself aside and hides
behind atable for protection Bundy reaches for his
gun just as the two men start shooting Bundy is hit
but lunges for one of the men and grapples with him
Suddenly another couple of shots are fired and Bundy
staggers backward As he falls we HEAR rather than

see the two men rushing off because the door to the
front store swings closed as Bundy crashes to the floor -
-- and we can HEAR the footsteps of the two men the
door BELL and the SLAM of the front door -

The two men come walking rapidly out of the store to
their car They do not have their guns in their hands»

‘Their faces are averted as WILLIAM DECKER a mailman

approaches He looks curiously after them Then a gun
drops from under the coat of one of the men right at 1
Deckers feet The man stoops quickly and scoops it up
Decker looks at him stunned Then the man gets into

piling into the two streets from all directions Ten

with sub-machine guns others with side arms deploy
behind doorways and approach cautiously as if they
are in the process of arresting a dangerous criminal

MED FULL SHOT - INT TIMES NEWS ROOM NIGHT

BRIAN KELLY the city editor is just putting down the
item He is a quiet chunky very wise soft-spoken
man of about 40 One of the characteristics about him
is that he smokes a brand of cigarettes with a hard
cardboard tip He doesnt use an ash tray but absently
pulls the cigarette out of his mouth by clamping five

fingers right around it and then stands it up on his -
deck so that little clusters of half-burned cigarettes

are always sticking up like tiny monuments on his desk
In the bg we can see the other reporters busy at their
desks and copy-boys walking around Still frowning at
the item Kelly reaches for a cigarette studies the

Zaleska gulps and then turns and looks out the window
He looks out with heartbreaking longing--the window draw-

turns around his face bitter

ZALESKA

fessed--who would I name as my

CLOSE SHOT - INT GUARDS ROOM DAY

We are close on the Keeler polygraph -- the lie detector

We can see three dials seven knobs and three pen

points set out on the graph paper It is a formidable
looking machine And as CAMERA slowly starts to PULL
BACK from it we ean HEAR Keelers voice coming OVER
SCENE

KEELERS VOICE
The machine simply registers emotional
disturbance

Now we can see LEONARDE KEELER the lie test expert
McNeal is standing right beside him looking at the
machine Keeler touches the blood pressure cuff

oe KEELER
This cuff attached to the upper right
arm controls the pen that records
pulse and blood pressure

(then he points

to the harness)
This harness goes around the upper
chest and connects with the pen
that records the rate of breathing
This is the galvanometer Emotional
tension increases the salt water in
your sweat glands and registers on
the machine

‘They both look up as the door opens and the Warden leads

Frank in The door has an upper half made of glass
The Warden closes the door and leaves Wiecek in the
roome
MCNEAL
Frank -- Mr Keeler is all ready
‘for you

Frank walks over to the chair indicated by Keeler and
sits down McNeal watches quietly as Keeler begins to

adjust two metal plates to Franks wrist Frank looks
at it a little bit scared
