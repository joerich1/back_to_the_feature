20 INT ARNAZ HOMELIVING ROOM - NIGHT 20

In the foreground--though out of focus--is the back of
LUCILLE BALL sitting on a couch with her bare feet up on a
coffee table She has a drink next to her and lights a
cigarette

In the background--in clear focus-is an RCA RADIOTURNTABLE
CONSOLE as we HEAR an announcer--

the finest watch you can wear
Gruen the finest watch you can
give brings you the man who gives
America the newsWalter Winchell

the Washington Post

The broadcast continues as we HEAR the front door open For
the next minute or so we’ll see no faces--just out-of-focus
arms and legs and other shards of the moment as they pass
through the frame which remains on the radio--the only thing
in focus

When the G-Men captured the
fugitives in the High Sierras last

week-—

LUCY (0S)

INT SOUNDSTAGE - DAY 22

20-odd people sit at a horseshoe of folding tables They’re
the cast and staff of I Love Lucy and behind them is the
iconic set from the show The group is largely silent They
smoke their cigarettes tap their scripts or just wait
quietly and nervously Two seats at the head of the table--
reserved with a card for Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz are
conspicuously empty

A woman finally speaks up The card in front of her reads
“Vivian Vance” We may notice that Vivian is considerably
more attractive in real life than she is when she’s playing
Ethel Mertz

VIVIAN
This is nonsense

She lights a cigarette

VIVIAN (CONTD)
It’s nonsense and it will get worse
before it gets better Little Rusty
Hamer When he signed his contract--
or the guardian whoever signs the
contract for him--he had to sign a
loyalty pledge Did anyone know
that

Nobody answers

VIVIAN (CONTD)

BOB
I’m starting to get a little tired
of your casual insults

FRAWLEY
Well my insults don’t feel like

your young writers that I don’t
work for them

MADELYN
Jess why don’t you tell your
supporting cast that we don’t work
for him either

FRAWLEY
We’re going to need someone to play
Lucy and Ricky those are critical
roles

JESS
The two of them are in Desi’s
office meeting with the network and
the sponsor right now I’m sure
there’s an explanation and that
this’ll be over by show night

FRAWLEY
One way or the other

JESS
Yeah No I mean--let me be clear--
I said this’1ll all be over by show
night and Bill said “One way or
the other” Gallows humor I said

standing around gawking

EXT HOTEL POOL - DAY 40

OLDER MADELYN

performing the famous grape-stomping scene and it’s

accompanied by AUDIENCE LAUGHTER--

First a WOMAN climbs into the vat and starts stomping on
grapes

LUCY looks over the edge and gives us her squeamish face The
WOMAN indicates with a wave of her arm that LUCY should come
in LUCY cautiously climbs in and gingerly puts her foot on
the grapes Her face reflects that this is a very weird
sensation The Italian WOMAN is stomping vigorously and LUCY
looks like she’s walking on eggs

questionable things Ricky’s
claiming on his deductions Lucy’s
sitting in the living room too and
of course when she’s asked by the
IRS agent to corroborate she can’t
tell a lie so--

It could be a good scene

He’s correct Once I write it it
could be good

I don’t Neither does Ricky
Especially when his wife is accused
of being un-American Look for
something else and start working on

LUCY

Jess They’re free to take us off
the air for the rest of the year
while continuing to pay our
contracts and answering questions
about why motherhood is too
salacious to put on CBS but
something tells me they’re not
gonna go that route Instead I
think Broadcast Standards and
Practices will give you a list of
insane restrictions which might
even include you winning your bet
with Desi and which I have no
doubt the three of you will
navigate beautifully

spend the little time we have
arguing about why we don’t have
more time

Don’t make me feel like a bitch
because I want to see my husband

DESI

I could stay home and be kept by my

that I’m setting a fancy table

FRAWLEY
You don’t need to explain it to
him

LUCY

(still to Scott)
We’1ll have flowers in a vase and
Ill cut one of the flowers--

FRAWLEY
He doesn’t care

LUCY
--it’ll be too short So I’11 cut
the other flowers and then they’11
be too short and so on

ScoTT
Got it
LUCY
So I need garden shears
ScoTT
Copy
LUCY

Regular scissors aren’t strong
enough to cut through the stems

FRAWLEY
He’s thinking a lot about killing
you now

street

FRAWLEY
It’s raining Is your hair gonna be
alright

LUCY
Im fine Since I started doing
this show rain bounces off my
hair

FRAWLEY
That’s helpful

LUCY
I honestly had no idea this place
was here

FRAWLEY

They like to keep a low profile
LUCY

It’s hard to imagine why
FRAWLEY

After you
LUCY

What kind of people go to a bar on
a Wednesday morning

FRAWLEY
It’s an eclectic group

They walk into--

90 INT DIVE BAR - CONTINUOUS 90

The place is empty except for maybe three people scattered
around LUCY and FRAWLEY head to the bar where they’re met by
a BARTENDER

FRAWLEY

Ill take a tetanus shot

FRAWLEY

You don’t drink at work

FRAWLEY

be drunk at work Have you ever
seen me drunk at work

LUCY
Would I know

FRAWLEY
No
(raising his glass)
Here’s to your new baby

LUCY
Alright then

They drink

LUCY (CONTD)
Are they being polite or do they
not recognize us

FRAWLEY
They don’t own television sets

LUCY
Why didn’t I think of that

FRAWLEY
Honey I read seven newspapers
every day

LUCY
Seven

FRAWLEY
Yeah

LUCY

When do you have time to do that

FRAWLEY
It’s 30 minutes between races at
Santa Anita it takes me a minute
and a half to pick a horse

LUCY
Aren’t you at work

Continued 90

FRAWLEY
Yeah we have bookies now and
telephones

LUCY
Know all about that Did a Damon
Runyon picture

FRAWLEY
In none of those seven newspapers
have I read anything about Lucille
Ball being a Communist I don’t
hear anyone talking about it

LUCY
Since when do you talk to anyone

FRAWLEY
I got news for you the less you
talk the more things you hear and
I havent heard anything
Soproblems at home

LUCY
Problems at home

FRAWLEY
Yeah

LUCY
No I’d like very much to have
problems at home but my problem’s
not home that much A few times a
week

FRAWLEY
He was playing cards on the boat
Wednesday night

LUCY
I know The picture’s six months
old and I was there when it was
taken I’m saying why wasn’t he
home Where I and our daughter
were

FRAWLEY
Your husband Ricky--

LUCY
Desi
86A
Continued 90

FRAWLEY
Desi--is in love with America like
no man I’ve ever known since George
M Cohan who loved America so much
he wrote the same song five times
Okay Desi loves America as much as
that guy But that doesn’t mean
he’s not Cuban

Continued 90

LUCY
I know that

FRAWLEY
The world he’s from has a very
narrow definition of manhood

LUCY
I know that too

FRAWLEY
The man is the man
LUCY
Mm
FRAWLEY

And you know what Not for nothin’
but the women are happy

LUCY
You’ve asked them

FRAWLEY
They look happy
LUCY
I see
FRAWLEY

But that’s neither here nor there

LUCY
It really isn’t

FRAWLEY
He’s mesmerized by you Lucille
And he misses you when you’re in
two different places he does I’m
a witness

LUCY
He doesn’t have to we live in the
same house

FRAWLEY

He does have to that’s what I’m
saying He has to spend time away
from you so that he can feel like
he’s not--

LUCY
--second banana I navigate male
egos for a living bud

Continued 90

FRAWLEY
Then why are you running the set
(beat)
Why are you running rehearsals
You’re doing it right in front of
him

LUCY
I can’t prioritize the directors
feelings over the health of the
show

FRAWLEY
No not--I couldn’t care any less
about Donald’s feelings if I tried
hard He’s a hack but we’ll
overcome that because frankly
were not doing Uncle Vanya

LUCY
Got it
(beat)
But the business at the dinner
table has to be precise

FRAWLEY
Really I was only in vaudeville 40
years so I wouldn’t know about
these things of which you speak

LUCY
I know you know So why do you care
if--
FRAWLEY
(over)
You did it in front of Desiis my
point
LUCY
(pause)

Lemme tell you something about
Desi He runs this show Every
creative decision goes through him
Every business decision--the
network Philip Morris--and if that
wasn’t enough he’s camera ready on
Monday It takes me five days to
get a laugh and he’s killing at the
table read and that man believe
me is nobody’s second banana

FRAWLEY
How many people know that

Continued 90

LUCY
Know what

FRAWLEY
That Desi runs the show How many
people know that

LUCY
(pause)
There’s me And I just told you

FRAWLEY
You get the picture

EXT HOTEL POOL - DAY 91

OLDER MADELYN
There was a minute there when Lucy
was gonna be a serious actress in
serious movies She was gonna
compete for roles with Crawford and
Hayworth It might’ve been Lucy in
All About Eve and you know what--
she’d have blown the doors off the
place It was almost like that For
a minute there

EXT LUCY AND DESIS BACKYARDPOOL - DAY 93

DESI’s sitting by the pool reading a book and after a
moment the back door flies open and LUCY runs out with her
shoes in one hand and a bottle of champagne in the other
She’s disheveled desperately gasping for breath

DESI
Lucy

LUCY tries to say something but doesn’t have the air yet

DESI (CONTD)
What happened

LUCY
(barely audible--breathing
heavy)
Flat tire ‘Bout a quarter mile
back

Continued 93

DESI
You abandoned the car there
LUCY
Sprinted the last five-hundred
yards
DESI

What’s going on Also you ran with
a bottle of champagne in your hand

LUCY
Bringing itmore festive I got
it I got the part

DESI
Which part

LUCY
I got the part Des The Big
Street

DESI

(pause)
You said it was going to Rita
Hayworth

LUCY
Scheduling problems Then they went
to Judy Holliday Scheduling
problems I’ve got the female lead
in The Big Street

That’s tremendous

breath
(pause)
It’s Damon Runyon

I know I read the script and I’m
very--I’m very happy I was just
looking forward to you coming out
on tour

LUCY
Rita Hayworth had scheduling
problems

Continued 93

DESI
So did you

LUCY takes a momentthen tosses her shoes aside--

LUCY
You don’t think I want to be in the
same city at the same time as my
husband What do I talk about every-

DESI
I know I know that

LUCY
Every decision I make is based on
being near you Every single
decision

DESI
Well yeah But obviously not every
single decision

LUCY
You know how many years I’ve spent
sticking my head in the frame
saying something bitchy and going
away Crappy little roles in
pictures I wouldn’t pay a nickel to
see if the theater had the only
available air conditioning If The
Big Street is a hit Ill be getting
the roles that go to Rita and Judy
and Betty

DESI
Which Judy

LUCY
Holiday Who’s the baseball player
you talk about The one that sat
down and let Lou Gehrig--

DESI
Wally Pipp

LUCY
--start that streak Gehrig was his
understudy

DESI
Backup

Continued 93

LUCY
And the guy took a rest one day and
Gehrig came in and didn’t come out
for forty years

DESI
Fourteen years and it was Wally
Pipp

LUCY

Okay well imagine if Wally Pipp
had scheduling problems and Lou
Gehrig instead of grabbing his
glove toured with his husband’s
Latin orchestra It would’ve
changed the course of baseball

DESI
And the course of Latin music

LUCY
Rita Hayworth is Wally Pipp I’m
Lou Gehrig The Big Street is the

Yankees

DESI
I understood the metaphor so long
ago

LUCY

You don’t have to tour You could
stay in town

DESI
And do what

LUCY
Sell out Ciro’s every night

DESI

We’re not a house band I’d like to
sell out New York Chicago and
Miami too

LUCY
I know Eight weeks I’1l1 come to
wherever you are on the weekends
So it’1ll be important that you not
fall in love with someone else
Mondays thru Fridays
92A
Continued 93

DESI
Agreed And it’1ll be helpful if you
don’t sleep with Henry Fonda or
Joseph Cotton

LUCY
How did Joseph Cotton get into the
conversation

Continued 93

DESI
I’ve heard rumors
LUCY
You really want to compare rumors
DESI
No
LUCY
Yeah
DESI

Hey look at me

LUCY
I already am

DESI

They’re rumors I have never and
will never have an interest in
being with anyone but you

LUCY
Should we open the champagne take
our clothes off and go skinny
dipping in the pool

DESI

That bottle of champagne is

basically a grenade now but all

your other ideas were good
(beat)

Lucy Jesus You’re gonna be a

movie star

LUCY
You comfortable with that

DESI takes LUCY by the shoulders

DESI
Am I comfortable with that

And the champagne bottle which is laying on its side
EXPLODES with the cork shattering a wine glass

Anyone as brilliant as you were in
The Big Street can call me Betsy
and I wouldn’t care

LUCY
Thank you

KOERNER
Sit Please Right there

Continued 95

They sit

LUCY
Thank you

KOERNER
That was a whole new side of you
we’ve never seen Where has that
been

LUCY
It’s been buried under bad movies

KOERNER
I’ve heard you make some form of
that joke before

LUCY
Keep putting me in pictures like
Big Street and you won’t hear it
again

KOERNER
Were dropping your contract Lucy

LUCY laughs

KOERNER (CONTD)
No it’s not a joke RKO’s dropping
your contract

LUCY
(pause)
I don’t understand

KOERNER
We don’t have anything for you

LUCY
(pause)
I don’t--This is happening fast
The Big Street was a hit

KOERNER
It was a critical hit

LUCY
I get there wasn’t a stampede to
the box office but you didn’t lose
money did you

KOERNER
No
Continued 95

LUCY
Do you understand the conditions
under which this picture was
finished

KOERNER
It has nothing to do with--

LUCY
Damon Runyon left town before
principal photography our director
joined the army during post-
production and our editor died He
just flat-out died

KOERNER
There were a number of obstacles

LUCY
That’s accurate Did you read the
reviews

KOERNER

They were very impressive
LUCY

They were more than impressive
KOERNER

Lucy-—
LUCY

I blew Henry Fonda off the screen

KOERNER
This has nothing--

LUCY
Henry Fonda who is very much under
contract here at RKO

KOERNER
As a matter of fact you blew him
off the screen ‘cause it was his
last picture he owed at RKO and
your director couldn’t get him to
give a damn

LUCY
Making my job that much harder

KOERNER
This has nothing to do with your
performance in The Big Street

Continued 95

LUCY
But it should have everything to do
with my performance in The Big
Street I showed what I can do and
that’s just the beginning of what I
can do That’s just the beginning
of it I can do comedy too Are you
sure this isn’t a joke

KOERNER
It’s a tough business

LUCY
I know that I’ve been in it since
I was fourteen

KOERNER
But you’re 35 now

LUCY
(pause)
And that’s the problem

KOERNER
No the problem is that you’re
really 39 aren’t you

LUCY
(pause)
Mm-hm 39-year olds don’t go to
your movies They don’t like seeing
stories about themselves

KOERNER
You came through for us when Judy
Holliday and Rita Hayworth were on
other pictures and we didn’t want
to lose Fonda This studio has a
handshake understanding with Metro
and Warner and they’1l loan us
Holliday or Hayworth so we just
don’t have enough for you that
would warrant keeping you under
contract

LUCY
Judy Holliday does one thing very
well but it’s just one thing

KOERNER
I know how you’re feeling right
now I’ve had to have this
conversation a hundred times

Continued 95

LUCY
I’m surprised ‘cause you’re
terrible at it

KOERNER
Can I make a suggestion
LUCY
Be younger
KOERNER
Radio
LUCY
(pause)

The hell did you just say to me
KOERNER

You’ve got the voice for it I’ve

noticed there’s a lot you can do

with your voice You should think

about radio

You should go fuck yourself Betsy

LUCY
I didn’t hear you

DESI
Bataan was a hit And I was good
The reviews were Valentines I
didn’t bang a drum It would’ve led

“RICKY” is helping “LUCY” through the front door “LUCY” is
wrapped in bandages

DESI
Honey--are you sure you’re alright
Are the bandages really fake

LUCY
Oh I’m fine Thank goodness the
Mertz’s had their awnings up

DESI
The whole thing was my fault
LUCY
No it was my fault Weren’t we
silly
DESI

Yeah We’1ll never fight again
They kiss “FRED” comes in the door looking very sad

FRAWLEY
You okay Lucy

FRAWLEY
Are you sure

And we cut Good Is that lunch

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

That’s one hour for lunch

DONALD
We’ll do notes on stage after and
go again

Everyone starts to leave--

LUCY
(stopping everyone)
One quick thing

Everyone stops

DONALD
(beat)
The table scene’s getting good

LUCY
Yeah it’s not but I wanted to
circle back and express again my
serious concern about Ricky’s
entrance at the top I brought it
up at the table read Monday and
there haven’t been new pages

JESS
Because it’s gonna work

LUCY
Hear me out

JESS
Okay

LUCY
Right now Lucy’s trimming the
flowers on the table when the front
door opens and Ricky comes in

JESS
We’re gonna have to cut the
flowers I don’t mean “cut the
flowers” I mean cut the flowers
Green Rev 101A
Continued 97

LUCY
(pause)
I couldn’t understand the
difference between those two line
readings

JESS
We’re running long We have to cut
the bit with the flowers
Green Rev Continued 97

She points

She points

DESI
How long

JESS
About a minute

LUCY
Alright we’ll get back to the
flowers The door opens Ricky
comes in and Lucy doesn’t see or
hear him which is unusual because
the front door is--you know--right
there and in previous episodes
weve established that Lucy’s eyes
and ears are connected to her
brain

JESS
We buy the conceit

LUCY
I’m sorry

JESS
We buy it Lucy’s so focused on
making the table nice she doesn’t
even notice Ricky coming in the
door

LUCY
Okay Ill run with that Ricky
walks up to her quietly puts his
hands over her eyes and says--

to DESI--

DESI
“Guess who it is”

LUCY
And Lucy says “Bill Sam Pat
Ralph”

JESS
She’s teasing him

LUCY
Yes She’s teasing him That’s
clear But then Ricky responds--

to DESI--
Green Rev Continued 97

She points

DESI
“Nol”

LUCY
No And there’s a stage direction
for Ricky that says “Burning” No
He’s upset Lucy continues the
teasing--George Julius Stephen
Ivan

BOB
We changed that to “Pedro Julio
Juan Guillermo”

MADELYN
(imitating BOB)
“Because those are Spanish names I
mean Mexican Cuban Latin They’re
Brazilian names Turkish”

BOB
You good

MADELYN
Yeah

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
Were moving into a meal penalty

LUCY
Lucy guesses some names

JESS
Teasingly

LUCY
And the script indicates that Ricky
then takes his hands away from
Lucy’s eyes turns her around and
says--—

to DESI--

DESI
“No It’s me”

LUCY
So my question again Jess is does
Ricky honestly truly believe that
there might be eight different men
who routinely walk into their
apartment--all of whom sound
exactly like Desi Arnaz
Green Rev 104
Continued 97

JESS
You think we’re saying Ricky’s
stupid

LUCY

I think we’re saying the audience
is And that’s something for which
they won’t soon forgive you

JESS

Do you charge for these lessons
LUCY

A ton
JESS

For the sake of the joke the
audience will take the leap with
us

LUCY
They will but they’1l need a
busload of orthopedists when they
land

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
Jess--

JESS
Let’s talk about it after lunch

LUCY
I have an idea

JESS
Ive got a crew here We’re about
to run into a penalty

LUCY
Lucy’s working on the flowers

JESS
We’re cutting the flowers for time
I don’t mean literally cutting the
flowers--

LUCY
I can not go through that again
Ricky opens the door comes in
shuts the door the way we’ve seen
him do in thirty-seven episodes
Lucy doesn’t acknowledge him
Green Rev 104A
Continued 97

JESS
So far you’re describing the
script

LUCY

Right But instead of playing the
hands-over-the-eyes guessing game
Ricky just stands there

(MORE )
Green Rev 105
Continued 97
LUCY (CONTD)
He can’t understand why Lucy didn’t
notice him come home anymore than
we can He stands there for a full
beat and then another and then
merrily and in a slightly
exaggerated manner says--as weve
seen him say a hundred times--

She points to DESI--

DESI
“Lucy I’m home”

Everyone LAUGHS and once the laughter dies down

LUCY
For Ricky is funny

JESS
Luce Let’s talk about it after
lunch
(to the AD)
Scott

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
(calling out)
That’s lunch One hour Back on
stage for notes

People begin to head off their separate ways FRAWLEY catches
LUCY’s eye and shrugs his shoulders as if to say “What did
we just talk about yesterday”

LUCY
(calling out)
Hang on

Everyone stops

LUCY (CONTD)
Des Did that work for you

DESI
Works perfect

LUCY
(to JESS)

BOB
I think we can get more out of
“hypocrite”
MADELYN
Yeah
JESS
Like what
BOB
Like Lucy says “Well it’s nice to

know I’m married to a hypocrite”
and Desi gets his back up and says--

MADELYN
“Hypocrite” then turns to Fred and
says “What’s a hypocrite”

BOB
Fred tells him-- “It’s a person who
says one thing but does another”
and Desi says “Thank you” and
turns back to Lucy and says--

MADELYN
“Oh yeah”

JESS
Good

BOB

Yeah that’s exactly what I was
going to pitch

MADELYN
But I pitched it faster

BOB
By interrupting me

MADELYN
How do you think I got to be a
woman in a comedy room

There’s a KNOCK on the door and LUCY sticks her head in--

Hey
(to JESS)
Is now a good time

Madelyn had a good idea We shoot
it both ways and see which one gets
the bigger laugh

That was my idea

LUCY
It’s a bad idea

MADELYN

It’s just not your day

LUCY
(to JESS)
Can I have a minute in your office

JESS
Sure

JESS gets up and walks out into--

INT CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

They step across the hall into--

INT JESS’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

JESS

I suppose
LUCY

Since we’re doing it both ways how
about we do it once with your pants
on and once with your pants off

Continued 100

JESS
It’s not the same

LUCY
It is and I don’t want to do the
version with my pants off in front
of two-hundred people But I need
to talk to you about something
else

LUCY closes the door

JESS
You’re not gonna tell me you’re
pregnant again are you

LUCY
No I’m still pregnant from before
but no Jess you know how much I
value you

JESS
I think I do

LUCY
You know you do

JESS
Okay

LUCY

And you also know what it is Desi
does around here

JESS
Sure

LUCY
I mean every business decision goes
through Desi In fact most business
decisions are made by Desi

JESS
You married a very bright man

LUCY
I did He also makes a lot of
creative decisions

JESS
(pause)
I’m not sure I’d say a lot

Continued 100

LUCY
WellI would I’d say a lot He
devised the camera system we use
He’s the reason the east coast
isn’t seeing the show on a foggy
kinescope

JESS
Yeah

LUCY
And even though we use three
cameras the studio audience can
see every scene that’s him too
And the cast the four of us we
can see the audience

JESS
I give him a lot of credit for
that

LUCY

He’s the one who thought up Lucy
being pregnant on the show

JESS
That’s never gonna happen ‘cause no
matter what CBS says Philip Morris
is never gonna let it happen but
like I said I give him credit

LUCY
That’s the thing though You don’t

JESS
What do you mean

LUCY
He doesn’t get credit as an
executive producer which let’s
face it is what he is You get
sole credit

JESS
I didn’t win my credit in a raffle
I earn it I’m the show runner not
to mention being the creator of the
show

LUCY
I don’t see how we could do the
show without you
109A
Continued 100

JESS
You absolutely could not
Continued 100

LUCY
I don’t see how we could do it
without Desi either

JESS
Because he plays Ricky which he
does get a screen credit for

LUCY
Jess--

JESS
Is this something our agents should
be talking about

LUCY
No

JESS
Because I’m not at all comfortable
with this conversation

comfortable I need you to help me

because you’re not as funny as I
am

JESS and LUCY step out of JESS’s office--
JESS
Mary Pat would you ask Desi if I

can come see him

MARY PAT
Sure

Continued 101

LUCY starts to head off and JESS slams his office door behind
him a lttle too hard LUCY clocks that and then calls into
the writers room--

LUCY
Madelyn

LUCY motions for MADELYN to step outside

MADELYN
Yeah
MADELYN steps into--
102 INT CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS 102

--and she and LUCY take a few steps away for privacy They
speak quietly

MADELYN
Was everything alright in there

LUCY
Yeah So listen it has to be
coherent If it’s anything goes
then nothing’s funny

MADELYN
Anything Goes was a hit

LUCY
Not Cole Porter’s Anything Goes I
mean-—

MADELYN
I know Why are you telling me

LUCY
The opening Ricky’s entrance with
his hands over my eyes that was
Jess right

MADELYN takes a moment before--

MADELYN
Outside of that room we make it a
point not to talk about who wrote
what

LUCY
It wasn’t Jess
Continued

MADELYN
(beat)
Again--

LUCY
You know I’m right about the logic
Why aren’t you backing me up
instead of endorsing some plan to
shoot it both ways

MADELYN
Listen why don’t we get together
for a drink or a swim this weekend
and we can put it on the agenda

LUCY
The show’s tomorrow and I’m fine
talking about it now

MADELYN
By all means let’s unnecessarily
add more to what you’re worried
about this week

LUCY
I’m not worried--

MADELYN
Shhh

LUCY
(quieter)
I’m not worried I’m saying that I
count on you to be the firewall--to
be--to make sure--just--logic
okay

MADELYN
I won’t say who wrote what but I
can tell you that I’m the lady in
there trying to make Lucy smarter

LUCY
(beat)
‘Scuse me

MADELYN
I’m the one trying every week to
make-—

LUCY
Lucy’s dumb
112A
Continued 102

MADELYN
(beat)
I didn’t say that
Continued

LUCY
But you’re trying--struggling it
sounds like--to make Lucy smarter

MADELYN
I created this character with you

LUCY
And she needs to be smarter

MADELYN
She sometimes for the sake of
comedy is infantilized

LUCY says nothing

MADELYN (CONTD)
This is a crazy week time and
place to be having this
conversation This is important to--

LUCY
How is she infant--

MADELYN
She literally says “Waaah”

LUCY

‘Cause when she does 60-million
people laugh--just like for Lou
Costello and Stan Laurel--and you
get paid

MADELYN
When those two grown men play slow-
witted five-year olds I cringe

LUCY
Then I question your comedy IQ

MADELYN
No you don’t you think I’m the
funniest writer in the room and
that’s why you’re talking to me and
not Jess

LUCY
Many people regard Lucy as clever
She always has a plan to overcome
an obstacle

MADELYN
Yeah but oftentimes that obstacle
is her husband’s permission
Continued 102

LUCY
You really think this week right
now is the best time to talk about
this

MADELYN
No I specifically said that 30-
seconds ago
(pause)
Look it’s just a female
perspective from another
generation

LUCY
Another generation You’re on a
roll

MADELYN
Bette Davis Bacall Hepburn--

LUCY
Funny women

MADELYN
--Judy Holliday--

LUCY
Judy Holliday Go to hell

MADELYN
They are funny women and they’re
smart and tough and they outsmart
the men Why do you and Gracie
Allen feel like you have to--

LUCY
Okay stop Stop stop stop Maddie
I love you You’re like I guess a
great-granddaughter to me from
another generation And it’s my
fervent wish for you that one day
youre half as funny as Gracie
Allen In the meantime please
remember that Lucy and Ricky and
Fred and Ethel if they live past
tomorrow have to live in a reality
that accepts the physical laws of
the universe Ricky knows that Lucy
doesn’t think there are possibly
eight other men in the apartment

MADELYN
Understood

JESS comes out of his office and calls into the writers room--

MADELYN

But I don’t make that decision

Mary Pat cut the flowers And to
be clear by “cut the flowers”--

She knows exactly what you mean

MARY PAT nods that she does
As JESS and BOB walk past MADELYN--

MADELYN
I just this minute told Lucy that
we don’t talk about who wrote what

BOB
And Madelyn came up with the joke
only seconds after I did

MADELYN
Isn’t it possible that two comedy
writers working on the same script
came up with the same joke at the
same time

BOB
It’s possible

MADELYN
Thank you

DESI
Do we have viewers who don’t know
how women get pregnant

JESS
Yes they’re called children

DESI
Do any of these children have
younger brothers or sisters

JESS
You know what else a lot of our
viewers are Christian

have a priest a minister and a
rabbi review every script

played by Desi

Please

I see what you think is the
problem
MACY
Lucy
LUCY
Yes
MACY

I don’t ordinarily come to meetings
like this I don’t pay attention to
casting issues This meeting is
several floors below my general
interest I’m here to deliver a
hard truth We can’t have an all-
American girl married to a man who
isn’t American

LUCY
He is American He was a sergeant
in the US Army and he served in
the war

MACY
You know exactly what I mean Lucy

phenomenally talented man Not just
a world-class musician but a very
good actor who would be a movie
star if there was such a thing as a
Cuban movie star Moreover we work
very well together I go out and
meet him when he’s touring and he
brings me up for some sketches and
it works Jess

JESS
It works

LUCY
Any cultural differences will make
for good comedy am I right Jess

JESS
Youre not wrong

LUCY
Now I don’t want to have another
meeting like this because I don’t
know how many more people will fit
around a table My position’s not
going to change You want me on
television and there’s only one
television show I’m willing to do
so what’s it gonna be

appropriate that she be so
credited And what do you mean it’s

marriage”

two minutes after the words came
out of Winchell’s mouth

(beat)
I told you it was stupid

LUCY takes that inand then decides to make a joke

LUCY
And you didn’t disappoint

LUCY
I didn’t even know newspapers had
red ink

LUCY
I was cleared

DESI

Somehow the city editor a woman
named Agnes Underwood has a
photostatic copy of the affidavit
showing you registered in 1936 as a
voter intending to affiliate with
the Communist Party

LUCY
But I was cleared After the
testimony they stamped “canceled”
on the card I saw the card

DESI
Other papers are showing the
canceled card and they’re running a
caption that says “Note the
cancellation at left” but the
Herald-Express took the word
“canceled” out of the document
altogether

LUCY
Other papers

DESI
Yes but I’ve made calls and we’re
taking care of this

Cuban Pete and the joke about the
turtle I’m going to tell them what
happened I’m going to explain that
you checked the wrong box I’m
going to show them the cancelled
document and then I’m going to
bring you out so the press sees

LUCY
Fellas could we have the room for

Everyone steps out but LUCY and DESI They’re silent for a
moment before

DESI
Grandpa Fred Grandpa Fred Grandpa
Fred was wrong Lucy ‘Cause he

crime of being the mayor of a city

LUCY takes a long moment

LUCY
And what if they don’t applaud

They will And the press will write
that they did

MISS ROSEN takes the phone book and walks out

EXT ALLEY BEHIND THE SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT 124

LUCY is leaning against a wall in a private spot smoking a
cigarette We can see the lit “Desilu” sign in the distance
She takes a deep breath to settle herself

After a moment a heavy steel door opens VIVIAN looks in one
direction and then the other and sees LUCY She steps out--

VIVIAN
Someone said they spotted you going

Marlboros

VIVIAN
(pause)
I shouldn’t have piled on this
week It just--

VIVIAN shakes her head and waves it off

LUCY
What

VIVIAN
None of that matters right now

LUCY
It may be the last time we’re out
here Say it

VIVIAN
Lucy Ricardo’s married to a man six
years younger than she is and
Ethel’s married to her grandfather
And it’s understood as the
underlying premise for a running
joke that I’m not pretty enough
for him It got to me and at the
world’s worst time

LUCY nods her head she understands

LUCY
(pause)
That was a knockout dress

The heavy steel door opens and FRAWLEY steps out

perspective from a new generation
I care about you

After a moment
FRAWLEY

Id love for someone to bring me

Yeah there’s no one within the
sound of her voice who doesn’t know

since the first day of work it’s
not like you’ve finally given voice
to your feelings You know what
sweet ladies Something dies inside
a man--it just dies--the first time
he hears a girl call him old So on
the subject of Jess Bob and
Madelyn writing “Ethel” jokes I’m
indifferent

LUCY

»e-are good actors It’s a
privilege doing this show with you

There’s a long silence before

FRAWLEY
Now you’re scaring the shit outa
me

VIVIAN

I was just gonna say

LUCY

Desi’s gonna tell the audience
He’s invited press He’s betting
the audience will accept the truth
give their approval and the press
will write about it

Id take the other side of that
bet

set carrying a folded newspaper

DESI

Thank you thank you very much

groundbreaking camera system that
allows the studio audience to watch
the show unobstructed and I’d
introduce you to the rest of the
cast

I’m not doing that tonight and
here’s why Last week my wife
Lucille Ball was asked to testify
in front of a closed session of the
House Un-American Activities
Committee

There’s a murmur in the audience

DESI opens the paper and shows them the headline The

DESI (CONTD)
Yeah the congressmen who
investigate Communism After hours
of testimony the committee
concluded unambiguously that Lucy
was and is in no way involved with
the Communist Party So
everything’s swell right No
Because this is the evening edition
headline in the Herald-Express

AUDIENCE GASPS

DESI (CONTD)
So I made some phone calls I
