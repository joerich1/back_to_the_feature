It was depressing to see the boy
caught up in that cattle call

MICK
Boy

DOBBS
Ive represented the family so long
I think of Louis that way

MICK
He did look a little frail My
advice is let Mr Valenzuela fix
you up with a bond and take the
boy home

DOBBS
A bond But Mrs Windsor was
thinking of putting up property

MICK
No good Assessing it will take
days By then Louis might be
carrying somebodys child
(before Dobbs can argue)
So just tap Val for the bond

office Well meet there at Four

And heads off again Dobbs follows him out

RAUL (V0) (contd)

Upon letting him in she was

your initials on it

LOUIS
This wasnt the knife in the file--

MICK

Thats right The file Raul got us

have been on to him because they
used it to set us up So wed think
they had nothing when in fact they
had enough to put your Hugo Boss

No No need A beat Rauls dog barks from outside

MICK (CONTD)
Of course the story goes on from
there From there its about the
lawyer Martinez gets himself

RAUL
Dont do this to yourself

MICK
(ignores on a roll now)
The lawyer who just assumes he did
it because of the DNA The lawyer
who gets him the best deal he can
and feels pretty good because the
deal keeps his client off Death
Row and this guy this lawyer
hes all about the deal see

INT COURTROOM

MICK (CONTD)
My names Michael Haller and Im
representing Louis Roulet
(glances at Ted)
Mr Minton doesnt want to use the
word prostitute for the woman whos
supposed to be Louiss victim He
neednt worry this case isnt
about how she makes her money
But it is about her actions How
she saw a young man with signs of
wealth and chose to target him
(closes in on the jury)

What she didnt count on was you
The fact that youd put two and two
together and let your common sense
tell you who was the real predator

CUT TO INT COURTROOM CORRIDOR - LATER

As Mick exits with Lorna for the lunch-break Low-voiced--
LORNA

You had a message from Gloria She
thinks she can do what you asked

MICK
Thinks

LORNA
Corliss has the same meal time She
can try

MICK

(DISCOURAGED)

Let her try But it may not matter

LORNA
What do you mean

MICK
I mean Corliss isnt on the
witness list It could be Ted
Minton is holding him back He
wont use him until he has to
Until I screw up his case so bad he
has no choice

LORNA
Mickey Can you do that
Off Mick tries for a confident smile

CUT TO INT COURTROOM LATER - ON THE STAND

FEMALE COP (MAXWELL)
Id describe Ms Campo when we got
there as hurt and frightened

Frightened

OFFICER MAXWELL
She kept asking us if she was safe
even after Roulet was taken away

INT COURTROOM LATER

Mick has Maxwell on cross Clerk hands her pages

MICK
Officer would you read from your
arrest report where its marked

OFFICER MAXWELL
The victim does not know the man
who assaulted her or why she was
attacked

MICK
Why did you write that she didnt

know him

OFFICER MAXWELL
Because thats what she said

MICK
So she just opened the door at ten
oclock to a stranger

OFFICER MAXWELL
She didnt put it like that

MICK
Was there blood on his right hand

OFFICER MAXWELL
(confused by the shift)
No his left Or we would have
bagged his right one too

TED
Had you known Miss Campo before

TALBOT
Nope Just called her up

TED
How did you know to call her

TALBOT
From her website Shes got a real
good website
Jury laughs a little Fascinated but repulsed by this guy

TED
Did you have sexual relations

TALBOT
Four hundred bucks worth And she
earned every cent
Angle a male JUROR red-faced with disapproval Mick catches
his reaction likes it Ted goes on

TED
And what time did you leave

TALBOT
About five minutes before ten

TED
She say she had another engagement

TALBOT
No she acted like she was done for
the night

MICK

TALBOT
I just mean she acted satisfied

FULLBRIGHT

(OFFENDED-- )
Sustained Go on Mr Minton

TED
When you left what condition was
she in Was she hurt
TALBOT
No she was fit as a fiddle I know

Sorry your honor She was fine
Minton goes lifts a sheet over an easel REVEALS the blown-
up PHOTOS of the Reggies battered face

TED
She didnt look like this

TALBOT

pleasurable love Which is what
life is all about Then I paid her

MICK
Mr Talbot are you right or left-
handed

TALBOT
Left

MICK

Left And isnt it true that before
you left Regina Campo asked you to
strike her repeatedly in the face

TED

(OBJECTING)
Your honor theres no basis for
this sort of questioning Mr
Haller is just muddying the waters
with outrageous statements
Fullbright looks to Mick for a reply Mick half-shrugs

MICK
Part of the defense theory Judge

FULLBRIGHT
The witness can answer

TALBOT
I never hit her or any other woman

MICK
Do you know a prostitute named
(checks his sheet)
Shaquille Barton Shaquilla
Shakels is her work name

TALBOT
Okay yeah I seen her one time

MICK

LANKFORD
Good enough to search your house
For a Woodsman registered to you

SOBEL

The worst yet Lankford laughs How convenient

INT MICK HALLERS HOUSE - LATER - ON

LANKFORD

We got the history on the piece

Turns out it belonged to Mickey
Cohen the gangster in the forties

MICK
know My father represented him
He got him off for using it in self-
defense so Cohen made him a
present of it
Sobel careful opens it Its empty Like Mick said

SOBEL
Why didnt you report it stolen

MICK
Because I knew who took it
(They look at him)
A client He told me so I couldnt
turn him in without breaking a
trust They do that
LANKFORD
(doesnt buy this)
Still and all mind if I look
around Just in case you havent
had time to toss it off a pier

MICK
Go crazy Youve got the warrant
Lankford sneers starts for the next room To Sobel--

LANKFORD
Heidi-- bag the box
He leaves As she bags it-- He wonders why

MICK
You cant do ballistics on a box
She glances seeing Lankfords gone-- explains

SOBEL
That old Mickey Cohen shooting
Its kind of famous It turns out
the county still has the evidence
in storage The bullet

MICK
You can match casings to a slug
thats fifty years old

SOBEL
Itd be easier with the gun but

She goes to join her partner Mick stops her with--

MICK

INT COURTROOM LATER - TED RISES

TED
One last witness your honor The
prosecution calls Regina Campo

INT COURTROOM LATER - REGGIE ON THE STAND

Diminutive conservative dress dark curls around her pretty
face-- none of the aggressive sexiness Hesitant but frank
she

up-â€”

REGGIE
Its true that I lied I knew him
when he came to the door

TED
In fact youd arranged his coming
Miss Campo why did you lie

REGGIE
I was scared I wasnt sure the
police would believe me and I
wanted to make sure they arrested
him because hes an animal
She looks tentatively at Louis as if still scared-- then

looks away Louis is blank Mick takes it in Ted follows

TED
Do you regret that decision now

REGGIE
Yes If it helps him to get free
and do this to somebody else

MICK
Your honor prejudicial--

JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
Sustained
But ANGLE THE JURY the damage is done Reggies moved them

TED
I have no further questions for
Regina your honor
Ted sits

JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
Your witness Mr Haller
Mick about to rise when-- Louis grabs his hand Low-voiced--
LOUIS
I want to remind you of your words
You were going to tear her apart
and throw her entrails into the
sea

MICK
Thats it keep acting like you
pull the strings

LOUIS
I do

JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
Mr Haller
Emphatic Mick frees his hand straightens himself watched
by Louis Then all at once to surprise her--

MICK
Ms Campo have you engaged an
attorney to sue Mr Roulet for the
events of March Sixth

REGGIE
(recovers
No I havent

MICK
But have you talked to an attorney

REGGIE
I havent hired anybody or--

MICK
I asked if you talked to one About
a possible lawsuit
Micks crisp like he knows for sure She wilts a little

REGGIE
It was nothing more than talk

MICK
Did you ask if you could sue Mr
Roulet for damages

REGGIE
I thought what you say to lawyers
is private

MICK
If you wish you can tell the
jurors
Faces her Ted squirms seeing the box shes in

REGGIE
I think I want to keep it private
Ted squirms again Wrong answer

MICK
Okay lets go back to the night at
Morgans Had you ever seen Louis
Roulet before that night

REGGIE
Yes There and other places

MICK
Ever noticed he wore a Rolex watch

REGGIE
NO--
MICK
Or that he drove one of two cars a

Porsche or a Range Rover

REGGIE
I never saw him driving

MICK
And what made you approach him

REGGIE
I knew he was in the life You
know A player I had seen him
leave with girls who do what I do

MICK
With prostitutes To go to a hotel
or their apartments

REGGIE

I dont know where

MICK
So how do you know they left Maybe
they just went out for a smoke

REGGIE
Because they got in his car and
drove away

MICK
But you just testified that you
never saw Mr Roulet drive Now you
saw him leave with a prostitute
like yourself Which is it
The contradiction rings round the room Reggie tries

REGGIE
I saw him get in a car but I didnt
know what kind it was

MICK
Do you know the difference between
a Porsche and a Range Rover

REGGIE
ones big and ones small I guess
Reactions Reggie shakes her head knows shes not making
it But Mick like hes just getting started

MICK

The women he left with when you
saw them again had they been
beaten or injured

REGGIE
I dont know I didnt ask

MICK
But girls in your profession talk
about customers dont you Warn
each other if someones a freak

REGGIE
Yeah usually

MICK
And how many had warned you about
Louis Roulet

REGGIE
None No one

MICK
So you believed youd be safe

REGGIE
I thought he was a known quantity
and I needed the money so

MICK
So you thought he could solve your
need for money

REGGIE
NO--

MICK
No Isnt that why were sitting
here Because you zeroed in on him

REGGIE
No I mean yes but not like that--
(looking round a plea to

BE BELIEVED)
He attacked me I swear

MARY WINDSOR
Yes I recognize this knife
(holding an evidence bag)
Its the one my son carried with
him for protection for the last
four years Almost exactly

MICK
Why would he need protection

MARY WINDSOR
Because realtors alone in a house
are sometimes robbed or hurt
Even raped or murdered

HAS
MICK
But has Louis ever been the subject
of such a crime

MARY WINDSOR
No But he knew someone who
(hesitates)

MICK
Go on please

MARY WINDSOR
She was raped and robbed by a man
Louis found her It was terrible
The first thing he did afterwards
was get himself a knife to carry
at all times
(looks at Ted Minton)
March Sixth would have been no
different

TED
Or do you somehow remember because
the police came to talk to Louis

MARY WINDSOR
There was no police investigation

TED
Then how can you remember the exact
date so well
(sly look at Mick)
Were you given the date before
testifying here

MARY WINDSOR
I know the date because Ill never
forget the day I was attacked
The news falls on Ted She goes on before he can rally
MARY WINDSOR (contd)
Louis will never forget it either
He found me in that house tied up
Naked It was traumatic for him
Shes perfect a strong woman unused to showing emotion
Mick smiles impressed When with some sarcasm

JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
Mr Minton-- anything else
Ted still thrown stares down at his notes

TED
As Louiss mother youd do or say
anything to save him wouldnt you

MARY WINDSOR
I wouldnt lie Not about what
happened that day

TED
We have no police or hospital
record that it even occurred

MARY WINDSOR
I never reported it

TED
Why not

MARY WINDSOR
I was ashamed If you dont
understand that I cant explain it

Roulet your honor

INT COURTROOM LATER - LOUIS ANSWERS ON DIRECT

LOUIS
I turned toward the living room

ANGLE MICK has a floorplan of the apartment on an easel

MICK
And what happened when you turned

LOUIS
Something hit me and I blacked out
I dont know for how long

MICK
That was all

LOUIS
Then when I woke up these guys were
on me telling me not to move I
couldnt anyway I was too scared
Mick moves toward Louis as if determined to find flaws

MICK
But there was blood on your jacket
and your left hand

LOUIS
Someone put it there because I
didnt

MICK

Are you left-handed

LOUIS
No

MICK
You didnt strike Ms Campo with
your left fist

LOUIS
No

MICK
Threaten to rape her or kill her--

LOUIS
No

MICK
Youre angry Why

LOUIS
(passionate but simple--)
Do you know what its like to be
accused of something like this To
listen to people tell lies about
your having done something so sick
and awful I I understand I had to
be quiet and wait my chance and not
say anything-- but if guilty people
have rights what about innocent
people I am innocent
Mick Meets Louiss eye communicates You were perfect

MICK
Nothing further Judge
Ted already up and moving passes Mick as he takes his seat--

TED
According to you Ms Campo punched
herself or had a man she never met
before punch her lights out as part
of a set-up

LOUIS
All I know is that I didnt

TED
And this knife you always carry
how did she know shed find it on
you as part of the set-up

LOUIS

(HONEST)
She couldnt could she I mean I
never took it out or showed it to
anybody-- so she must have just
found it when she went into my
pocket for the money I had that I
was going to pay her with right--

TED
Id really prefer it if I ask the
questions and you answer them
(then calming himself)
Would you look at this please--
Goes to the easel REVEALS PHOTO of Reggies beaten face

TED (CONTD)
Please tell us again if you think
Regina Campo would or could have
done this to herself

LOUIS
I dont know who did it but it
wasnt me Nobody deserves that to
happen

TED
(seizes on this)
What do you mean by deserves Do
you mean crimes of violence come
down to a whether a woman gets what
she deserves

LOUIS
(right back at him)
I mean no matter what she does for
a living or who she is-- No woman
deserves that
Ted keeps staring at the photo Wants the jury looking
there

TED
I have no more questions
At which suddenly theres a wave of movement-- SLOW-MOTION-

Louis dismissed from the chair-- Ted returning to his seat
passing Mick as Mick rises--

to talking about cigarettes

CORLISS
Not exactly He was like bragging

abounding confidence Mick stews Swivels around

Covert glance MICKS POV looks to see if Kurlen is where

And the courtroom door still swings slightly as if theyve
just left While IN FRONT

JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
Any re-cross from the defense
Mick rises to answer hesitates-- and just then turns to see
Lorna enter and approach down the aisle

A command Mick nods Returns to the witness Corliss--

MICK

CORLISS

MICK

example down in Phoenix right

CORLISS
Maybe
Hes a bit wary Mick looks through the file Lorna

MICK
Because you know my assistant she
was just reading on the internet
about DJ Corliss-- arrested in
Phoenix 1989 on drug charges--
Hometown of Mesa Arizona

CORLISS
Yeah thatd be me But--

MICK
You remember Fred Bentley right
Corliss darkens stumbles at this-- Teds quick--

TED

defense going with this

JUDGE FULLBRIGHT

But the witness can answer

CORLISS
I dont remember any Bentley--

MICK
Sure you do You testified that he
confessed to you the crime he was
charged with-- rape of a ten-year-

brought--
old girl-- even though he denied
his guilt in court Am I ringing
any bells DJ

CORLISS

us DJ Its a printout of a news
story from the Arizona Star 1997
thats eight years after he was
convicted I ask that it be
admitted into evidence--

TED

JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
Lets see where it takes us The
state can object later
Mick hands printout to the bailiff who gives it to Corliss

MICK
Ive marked the paragraph

CORLISS
I aint too good at reading
(clears his throat)
A man Frederick Bentley wrongly
convicted of rape was released
Saturday after con--

(HESITATES)
--conclusive DNA results cleared
him of the crime The case was
bolstered at trial by testimony
from an informant DJ Corliss of
Mesa who claimed Bentley had--
bragged to him about the rape while
together in a holding cell--
MICK
Thats enough
(takes it from him)
Were you charged with perjury for
that incident DJ

CORLISS
No I was not

MICK
Was that because the police were
complicit in your confession

TED
(rises angry--)
Judge how can the witness know
what went into the DAs decision

MICK
(ignores over--)
Were you promised the same deal
here Mr Corliss To say that
Louis Roulet bragged to you in
the holding cell

JUDGE FULLBRIGHT
Alright Mr Haller that will do

MICK
