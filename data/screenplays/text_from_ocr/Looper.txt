Production draft

EXT EDGE OF CORN FIELDS - DAY

A pocket watch Open Ticking Swinging from a chain

Held by a young man named JOE in a clearing beside a Kansas
corn field Sky pregnant with rain

Waiting He checks the watch removes his earbud headphones
stands

Without much ceremony a BLOODIED MAN in a suit appears from
thin air kneeling before the young man Hands and feet
tied Burlap sack over his head Muffled screams gagged
With no hesitation Joe raises a squat gun and blows the man
apart with a single cough of a shot

LATER
Joe loads the corpse into the flatbed of his truck
Cuts open the back of the bodys jacket revealing FOUR bars
of gold taped to the dead mans back Joe takes them

EXT INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY

Massive in the middle of nowhere Black smoke

JOE (VO)
Time travel has not yet been
invented But twenty five years
from now it will be Once the
technology exists it will be
relatively cheap and available to
the public at large And so It
will be instantly outlawed used
only in secret by the largest
criminal organizations And then
only for a very specific purpose
Joe drives up and parks his truck removes the wrapped
corpse
from the flatbed

JOE (VO) (CONTD)
Its nearly impossible to dispose
of a body in the future Im told
Tagging techniques whatnot So
when these future criminal
organizations in the future need
someone gone they use specialized
assassins in our present called
loopers

INT INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY

Cavernous and empty Joe carries the body to an iron hatch
opens it and dumps him in

JOE (VO)

And so Thirty years from now My
employers in the future nab the
target they zap him back to me
their looper And I do the
necessaries So the target has
vanished from the future and Ive
just disposed of a body that
technically does not exist Clean
The body slides down a long chute Vanishes in a little
flare of angry red fire

EXT DINER - DAY

A sidecar roadside diner in the middle of nowhere Joes
truck in front

basket labeled A€eLOOPERS - BLUNDERBUSSESA€U

Slips down a narrow passage which ends at a steel wall with
a protruding duct taped camera and microphone

JOE
Two Jedd

Joe fishes the two gold bars from his jacket

A small narrow slot slides open in the wall and gnarled old
hands take the gold bars It slides shut again

In the background the front door to the pawn shop dings

The slot slides open and Jedds hands push a wad of cash
Joe pockets it and backs around Dale another Looper

DALE
Hey Joe Be at the Belle tonight

JOE
Yup
Dale hands four gold bars through the slot as Joe retrieves
his gun and exits

DALE
Four Jedd
INT JOES APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

Seth holds a quarter idly in his palm

SETH

The coin lifts floats several inches in the air

JOE

Joe notices the floating quarter

quivering
JOE (CONTD)
And dont if were going in dont

SETH
Chicks dig TKs

JOE

Seth catches the quarter sullen

JOE (VO) (CONTD)

EXT LA BELLE AURORE - NIGHT

A shitty but bright nightclub in the heart of the city

Drives past revving the engine

A claustrophobic maze of twisty halls and passages

eyes
JOE

DALE

He closed his loop
This lands heavily on Joe

JOE
No shit
The door at the bottom of the stairs opens and ZACH
another
looper steps out An OLDER MANS HAND pats his shoulder
then retracts into the door
The loopers watch him in awe

JOE (VO) (CONTD)
Theres a reason were called
loopers

EXT ABANDONED LOT - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Zach stands waiting checking his wristwatch gun in hand
Obviously performing a similar ritual to Joes

JOE (VO)

Time travel in the future is so
illegal that when we sign up for
this job we agree to a very
specific proviso

Zach raises his gun

JOE (VO) (CONTD)

If our employers in the future get

busted up by the law their first

priority is going to be erasing any

trace of their relationship with us

ever existing

A flash of light and a HOG TIED MAN with a sack over his
head kneels in front of Zach

Zach fires and the mans chest explodes

JOE (VO) (CONTD)

So If theyre busted and if

were still alive 30 years from

now theyll find our older self

and zap him back to us like any

other job

Zach rips open the back of the corpses jacket revealing
several dozen gold bars taped to his back

JOE (VO) (CONTD)

This is called closing your loop

Zach freezes Looks at the shape of the corpses face
through the sack

JOE (VO) (CONTD)
And you get paid out a mythic
amount of money and you get a
handshake and get released from
your contract Enjoy the next 30
years

INT STEEP STAIRS
Zach reaches the top of the stairs a grin on his face

JOE (VO)
This job doesnt tend to attract
the most forward thinking people

So are we celebrating

jeans This is KID BLUE

A FLOOR SAFE with a touch pad He enters a code opens it
Wide and deeper than youd expect lined with gold bars Big
enough for a man Seth scrambles in

Joe takes one last look at Seths frightened grateful face
framed by the gold bars then closes the safe and smooths

oriental rug

POUND POUND POUND- Joe opens the door

Kid Blue storms in his gun drawn sweeping through the

EXT LA BELLE AURORE - DAWN - ESTABLISHING

INT STEEP STAIRS

Kid Blue leads Joe down the stairs and into the door at
their
base

INT WAITING ROOM

Dingy with a few benches In one wall three steep stairs
lead to a high door Kid Blue knocks Muffled voice from

WITHIN

ABE (0S)
Two minutes

LATER
Joe and Kid Blue on benches facing each other The Kid
stares daggers and spins his gun Joe tries his best not to
engage

KID BLUE
You know why they call that pea
shooter a blunderbuss Cuz its
impossible to hit anything farther
than 15 feet and impossible to
miss anything closer A gun for
fuck up turkeys Not like a gat
A gat has range Accuracy
His gun spinning gets fancier His gun meaner looking than
Joes blunderbuss long and slim and chrome

JOE
Alright cut it out Kid Youre
gonna blow your foot off again
The Kid almost snaps back but then grins

KID BLUE
Youre right itd be real easy for
it to accidentally go off
He clicks the safety off Joe shifts uncomfortably

JOE
Cmon

KID BLUE
Dont disrespect a gat man Looper
Joe stifles a chuckle
In a flash the Kid stands and pistol-whips him across the
face Joe falls back The Kid raises his gun at Joe
Frozen in that tableau a moment the Kid savors his victory
Lowers his gun

ABE (0S)

What the hell is going on out there-

The high door swings open fast SMACKING Kid Blue hard on
the

side of the head His gun goes off firing into the wall

Out of nowhere three gat men burst into the room guns
drawn

ABE a sallow man in his 50s appears in the high doorway

KID BLUE
Salright salright
Humiliated the Kid tries to stand but falls over again
After a moment everyone realizes whats happened and the
tension breaks

ABE
Alright Joe
Joe climbs into the doorway Kid Blue stands shakily
ABE (CONTD)
You didnt shoot your other foot
off didja kid
The door closes and the gat men laugh at the Kid

INT ABES OFFICE

Cluttered with a big desk Joe sits Abe hands hima
handkerchief for the ugly gash on his cheek

ABE
My great grandfather always told my
grandfather mens like spiders

JOE
Seth

ABE
Youre expecting were gonna break

your friend

JOE
My friend Seth Im confused

ABE
Well then Ill talk a little You
know you were the youngest looper I
ever hired You looked goddamn
ridiculous they said the
blunderbuss up to here on you But
I remember they brought you in I
forget what it was for

JOE
Watch shop

ABE
Thats yeah you had rolled one of
our fronts a watch shop And they
had you your arms pinned this
kid Like an animal But you
looked at me your hair stuck to
half your face so just this one eye
looking at me And I thought
whats this kid lived through what
he had taken away from him Whats
he lost And I could see like
seeing it happen clear as seeing
it the bad path in front of you
the bad version of your life Like
a vision I saw it happen you
turning bad So I cleaned you up
and put a gun in your hand I gave
you something that was yours

JOE
You know Im grateful Abe
Genuine But Abe shakes his hands not where hes going

ABE
I gave you something that was
yours And I remember that kid
and I think when you ask yourself
you ask who would I sacrifice for
whats mine I think Seth is deep
and cozy inside that circle
Pause Both their eyes go to a hammer sitting on the desk

ABE (CONTD)
That hammers there for something
else later thats not its a bad
coincidence

JOE
Okay

ABE
Show you how much I know you Im
not even gonna break you just set
you back a ways

ABE (CONTD)
We know youve been stashing half
your bars Which is smart You
give up Seth or you give us half
your stash For Seth
Joe holds Abes gaze for a moment then his eyes drop and
its over

JOE
Will you kill him

ABE
No Would be too cataclysmic a
change to the future What well
do is dangerous in that regard but
not as dangerous as killing him
and not by twice as having him run
free

(BEAT)
Joe I let him run more than a few
days the boys in the future get
nervous then bing my replacement
shows up With a gun So well do
what we have to do
Silence

INT BORDELLO ENTRANCE
Joe slumps in Several girls none of them Suzie

MADAME
Suzies just getting off Doubt

He pushes through the velvet curtained door

INT BLACK HALLWAY

A large gat man pushes past Joe

At the end of the hall Suzie leans in a doorway smoking a

cigarette Not sexy just tired She sees Joe and is about
to say no But she sees Joes eyes and doesnt

Exhaling a plume of smoke she withdraws into her doorway

Joe follows Through her smoke

INT SUZIES BEDROOM - LATER

Suzie naked at the mirror She goes to Joe lying on the
bed distant
JOE
cant remember my mothers face

Like this
He takes Suzies hand strokes it over his hair She smiles
briefly tired then takes her hand away and puts drops in
his eyes

JOE (CONTD)

JOE

SUZIE
What in nature

(BEAT)
You know I get this a lot
Especially young guys I must have
wife eyes or something
His face clouds

INT JOES APARTMENT - NIGHT
Joe gets home Empty quiet Everything in place He goes

to the rug pulls it aside Opens the safe
All the gold and nothing else One bar juts from the side
knocked out of place
He pushes it back and when he lifts his fingers they have a
bright smear of fresh red blood

EXT CITY OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT

A hunched figure sprints through an abandoned lot towards a
train yard
It is a 55 YEAR OLD SETH He limps up to a razor-wire fence
bordering the train yard
Surveys the sharp wire rips the lining from his jacket and
wraps first his left hand then his right

But stops

On the palm of his right hand a WEATHERED SCAR Clearly
carved in the shape of an arrow pointing down to his wrist
Old Seth squints at it confused He pulls back his sleeve
revealing his clean bare forearm

Then his face changes

Because his arm is no longer bare Suddenly out of nowhere
more intricate scarring has appeared down its length

The scars spell out clearly Aa€eBE AT 75 WIRE STREET IN 15

MINUTESAE
Old Seths breath returns jagged He pulls his sleeve up
and hoists himself up the fence climbing fast
He reaches the top gets a good grasp on the wire to hoist
himself over and stops again
His right hand is missing a finger The ring finger is just
gone its stump worn with age
Old Seth stares And now his middle finger is gone as well
A freight train whistle moans The cars open and inviting
leading out of town Behind him the city
Terror and indecision seizes his chest so much so that it
takes a moment for him to realize the sound of his breathing
has changed to a ragged whistle

He lifts his hand now with just two fingers to his face
and the smooth scarred hole where his nose used to be

EXT CITY STREETS

The train yard far in the distance Old Seth RUNNING back
into town
the

missing

He looks down at his right hand fingerless now but for his
thumb

He speeds up desperate Cuts through an alley And has no
right hand just a stump

OLD SETH
No no no no no
A bell-like DING Old Seth spins sees a WEDDING BAND lying
on the sidewalk
He picks it up with the four remaining fingers on his left
hand stuffs it in his pocket sobbing
Bursts out of the alleyway limping now straight into the
street and into the headlights of an oncoming car
The car screeches to a halt and its harsh white light shows
Old Seths missing right ear and deep scars down his face

IN THE CAR
Old Seth throws open the drivers side door and throws out

DRIVER Jams on the gas
Speeding through the streets hands slipping on the wheel
His pant leg crumples Empty boot tangling with the pedals

EXT WIRE STREET

The car hits a pole
Out climbs whats left of Old Seth his face mangled

a foot one arm gone to the elbow

Street sign - WIRE STREET The numbers 45

He runs Howling missing his tongue Arm totally gone
Then falls as his leg goes to the knees And hes crawling
an animal form bellowing wordlessly

Makes it to an iron street-side door 75 And with his one
arm slams it

Slumps against it heaving After a long moment it swings
open

With no hesitation a BLAST from the darkened doorway and
Old Seths head mists open He slumps to the pavement

Kid Blue steps from the doorway drags the body inside
Deep in the dark doorway we glimpse a DOCTOR in a surgical
frock smeared with bright red blood The door SLAMS
INT JOES APARTMENT - MORNING
Joe wakes with a start
EXT CORN FIELD

Joes pocket watch at 229 ticking away He takes his
stance Earbud headphones the drone of French lessons

A hog-tied MAN with a sack on his head appears kneeling
before Joe Joe raises his gun without hesitation and shoots
the man in the chest

Walks to the body flips it The mans hands tied and
purplish Joe hesitates Puts his hand next to them
Similar

He flips the man onto his back stares long and hard at the
shape of the mans face under the cloth sack

Tears it off An older Asian mans face frozen in terror
Joe smirks the spell broken His face hardens

INT PLANT - DAY

Joe watches the Asian mans body slide down the hatch and
vanish in a puff of distant fire

BEGIN MONTAGE

EXT CORN FIELD - DAY
Our montage comes to an end suddenly and all is silent

Joe in the corn field in his stance ready to draw
But nothing happens Silence Joe checks his watch
confused

230 and change Waits Watching the blank space where the
man is supposed to appear
Hand on his gun Breathing shallow Something is wrong
232 An eternity Then there he is
But different Not kneeling On his side so he flops over
and has to straighten himself The mans hands are UNTIED
Holy shit
Joe raises his gun scared Time slows Finger tightens on
the trigger
Then he sees the man has NO SACK ON HIS HEAD And the face
that stares back at Joe is his own

57 YEAR OLD JOE His eyes fixed on Joe

And for just one split second Joes face slackens and his
finger eases on the trigger

Its all the hesitation Old Joe needs He throws his body
into a spin

Joe snaps out of it and PULLS THE TRIGGER

The shot catches Old Joe square in the back and the impact
blows him forward But instead of blood beneath his torn
jackets back we see the layered gold bars spill out They
caught the blast

In what seems like one fluid motion Old Joes fingers grab
one of the bars he spins again throwing handfuls of dirt
and the bar back towards Joe

Joe flinches again just for a moment and when his eyes
focus again and his arm steadies the gun its too late

Old Joe is on top of him with a heavy blow knocking the gun
aside and with an even heavier one swinging down on Joes
head a fist and then

THE CORN FIELD HOURS LATER
Joe wakes Blood caked on his face Headphones beside him
still squawking French lessons Sits up

JOE
Oh god
Gold bars scattered in the dirt But no Old Joe And no
truck Joe staggers to his feet shaky Head thick But
realizing

JOE (CONTD)
Late to my own funeral
EXT FARMLAND ROAD - LATE AFTERNOON

Joe runs shaky towards town Fishes his phone-device from
his pocket chucks it

EXT JOES APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Across the street Joe huddles behind a car breathing hard
Looks up at his lit window Debating

INT JOES APARTMENT HALLWAY

Joe walks silently towards his apartment door
It is ajar He hesitates Knows he shouldnt

INT JOES APARTMENT

Holding his breath Joe edges in Its ravaged torn to
pieces The floor safe is open about half the gold bars
missing But the apartment seems empty

Exhaling Joe works quickly Knocks a tile aside pulls a
wad of cash from the wall A heavy jacket from the closet
Eyes dart around the room - what else But too late --
footsteps in the hallway Joe ducks into the bathroom just
as Kid Blue and a TALL GAT MAN enter the apartment

INT JOES BATHROOM

Joe crouches Outside Kid Blue piles the mans arms full of
gold bars

KID BLUE (0S)
Thats twenty four there Im
keeping count

TALL GAT MAN (0S)
Uh huh

KID BLUE (0S)
Two more trips should do it
Joe gently lifts himself off his haunches
sprint

exploding

out

INT JOES APARTMENT

he Tall Gat Man exits Kid Blue stays crouched over the
loor safe hefting out bars his back to the bathroom In
he distance a GUNSHOT Kid Blues head perks up

REAK From the bathroom Quick as lightning the Kid draws
is gat and spins - but Joe is already upon him full

Sadcmyy

LAM Joe tackles the Kid backwards But while Joe uses his
omentum to leap over the OPEN FLOOR SAFE the Kid tumbles
ack into it vanishing inside with a painful thud

oe scrambles to a stop lifts the heavy safe trap door and
LAMS it down - just as the Kids hand grasps the open edge
ith a sickening CRACK the trap door closes on the Kids
ingers

bellowing howl his fingers withdraw and the safe door
licks shut The ELECTRIC BOX rigged to the code pad to

rack it clatters off and whirrrr CLICK Locked Joe
anting goes on hands and knees to the safe door and shouts
lear and earnest

ATAAPMHANGCASEBN

JOE
id listen Kid Im sorry Tell
Abe Im going to fix this Tell
him keep my bars safe cause I swear
to god Im going to fix this Im
going to find my loop and Im gonna
ill him Tell Abe-
CRACK CRACK The wood paneled floor above the safe door
splinters upwards with gunshots and a chunk of Joes right
ear explodes
More blood than youd think spills down his neck Joe falls
back Three more shots - CRACK CRACK CRACK And now
footsteps running down the hall
Joe on his feet slipping in his own blood sprints across
the apartment The TALL GAT MAN appears in the doorway
shooting blindly at Joe chunks of wall and plaster

as Joe doesnt stop but JUMPS OUT THE WINDOW
EXT JOES APARTMENT WINDOW - NIGHT

5 floors up Joe leaps out hits the fire escape bullets
shattering the window Blind with blood ears ringing Joe
barrels down the fire escape A confused blur of iron steps
slipping and scrambling down but now the tall gat man is

the window and shooting down at him
Somehow Joe slips and rolls grabs at thin air falling -
three stories at least falling
When he hits the ground the world goes away

OLD JOE

EXT CORN FIELD - DAY

We abruptly CUT ON to a very familiar scene

Young Joe stands alone in the corn field in his stance
ready to draw But nothing happens Silence Joe checks

This is exactly the scene where Old Joe appears being
replayed before our eyes But when Old Joe does APPEAR its
different his hands are tied his head covered with a sack
And something very different happens

Joe raises his gun and without hesitation PULLS THE TRIGGER
Old Joes chest explodes He falls dead

pulls off the sack The face of his older self Old Joe

one man tears off the sack PUNCHES another man a flurry
and then its over He stands among a pile of broken men
Slowly takes stock Looks at the exit Looks at the faded

A mournful train whistle and he turns Through a chain link
fence the train yard He was put here for a reason

A man and a young boy in rags hop onto an empty cargo car
heading out of town Joe watches the boy his eyes angry
Stands shakily And walks away from the train yard
Something like a HELICOPTER sweeps overhead a spotlight
zigzagging the area Joe ducks into shadows heading towards
the city

to cut off this spiel youve theyre not yours anymore you
been practicing all night can say anything you want but
but need you to need you to youre not walking outta here
listen Listen alive

OLD JOE

You know what the voice of god
sounds like See now good youre
confused now but youre listening
I hope the voice of god sounds like
an old man speaking French Old
men speaking French sound like
primeval trees in a strong wind
just irrefutable Wise strong
gentle all these things in
harmony complimentary At once
Old men speaking French Young men
speaking French sound without

exception like weenies Fact
You ever hear a Frenchman under 40
try to sound threatening Its
hilarious English is a tight t-
shirt flatters the young Rat a
tat tat French is a double
breasted suit Young man can put
it on but it always feels like
hes putting something on Some
things you just need the years
Its my favorite language

JOE
Ive got a life ahead of me thats
mine and Im not giving it up for
you or anybody

OLD JOE
Well you know what you have to do
then why dont you take your little
gun out from between your knees and
do it One in the head two in the
heart Boy Its all a€eanybodya€el
and a€eneverd€ and then you show up
here and think you can talk me into
dying Well bullshit we both know
youre not going to kill me
Christ you ordered eggs
Old Joe downs two aspirin Takes a breath

OLD JOE (CONTD)

I know why you couldnt pull that
trigger When youre tasked to do
the unthinkable your mind itll
do anything it can to stop you
Only way is you gotta know why
youre doing it in your bones so
you can say it out loud to someone
without apologizing Or you gotta
cut yourself off go numb But
thatll kill you down the line
(BEAT)
Its hard to make eye contact with
you Its too strange

JOE
Your face looks backwards

OLD JOE
Yeah that helps actually That
little twist of unfamiliar

(BEAT)
Youre not winning some pissing
contest by looking me in the eye
you didnt know what I looked like
until yesterday it makes sense
that its easier for you

JOE
I wasnt trying to Do you know
whats going to happen Have you
already done all this right now
as me

OLD JOE
No not - exactly - I dont want to
talk about time travel shit
because well start talking about
it and then well be here all day
making diagrams with straws It
doesnt matter

JOE
When I hurt myself now it changes
your body Do my actions change
your memories

OLD JOE
It doesnt matter because I dont
know how it works Nobody knows
how it works Time travel was an
accident thirty years from now the
smartest men in the world know
exactly one thing about it that you
dont they know to be scared to
death of it

(BEAT)
My memory is cloudy theres a
cloud Its a it starts clear
then gets cloudy as it goes back
Goddammit hand me those
Straws Joe passes him two

OLD JOE (CONTD)

And the salt No the pepper The

pepper

Old Joe sets two straws about a foot apart parallel
pours pepper between them thus

OLD JOE (CONTD)
Ok the span between the straws is
a timeline of the next 30 years

THIS
(the left straw)
is the present moment right now

AND THIS
(the right straw)
is the moment thirty years from now
when I was sent back The machine
is tuned to a fixed time you know
that 30 some years its not
adjustable

JOE
Whats the pepper

OLD JOE
The pepper is a sort of fog See
my memories start clear here
(at the right straw)
but as they go back they get

and
cloudier until theyre totally
obscured Its like a fog

Because my memories arent really
memories theyre one possible
eventuality now and they grow
clearer or cloudier as they become
more or less likely But then they
get to the present moment

(the left straw)

And theyre instantly clear again
Like a wall of fog moving forward
with the present moment I can
remember what you do after you do
it

He pushes the left straw slowly towards the right and it
pushes the pepper with it

JOE
So you can

OLD JOE
And it hurts

JOE

So when were apart you can
remember what I do After I do it

OLD JOE
Uh huh But
Beatrix brings their food two identical plates Old Joe
awkwardly clears away the pepper and straws

OLD JOE (CONTD)

This is a precise description of a
fuzzy mechanism Time travel fucks
everything my brain and body try
to catch up Its messy Thats

why its dangerous And it hurts
All I know I know two things for
sure I know whats happening in my
head And I know that youre still
going to meet her

JOE
Who
Old Joe takes a worn double of Joes POCKET WATCH from his
pocket clicks it open We dont see inside it but he
stares at it intently

JOE (CONTD)
This is a woman what Im going to
fall in love with

OLD JOE
Shes gonna save your life
Old Joe makes eye contact with Joe for maybe the first

time
and holds it Unexpectedly naked on his face is the deepest
sort of grief Deep and unrelenting Joe cant look at it
he breaks off his gaze
The grief is too much for Old Joe to swallow back down so
he

turns it into anger

OLD JOE (CONTD)

For a long time at the beginning
she thought wed have a baby She
would have been a good mother She
wanted that so much And now Im
saying sorry to a picture

JOE
Shes How is she you said save
my life

OLD JOE

life Youre a killer anda

junkie And a fucking child
mentality a€eMy lifea€l a€ewhats

Why would someone waste themselves
on you give up the good life they
had sacrifice a good life to love

JOE

SAVED

OLD JOE
Shut your fucking child mouth
Shes going to clean you up and
youre going to take her love like
a sponge and youre both going to
pretend that shes saved you
youre so self absorbed and stupid

will swallow up the memories of her
and shell be gone

OLD JOE

He puts his hand on the folded papers

OLD JOE (CONTD)

A quick beat Joe goes for his gun But Old Joe is fast he
jams his foot into Joes crotch crushing the hidden gun

into
him Joe cries out Old Joe grabs his hair and plants his
face into the table
When Joes hands go to his face Old Joe grabs them and
pulls

Foot in his crotch pulling his arms tight over the table

OLD JOE (CONTD)

county And I can find him with

Joes face loosens his eyes on their coffee cups

JOE
Its been awhile since weve gotten
a warm-up
Old Joe realizes looks around The diner is eerily quiet
Beatrix and the staff have all quietly left Fled
Old Joe swings out of the booth still holding Joe by the
hair dragging him like a doll Joes blunderbuss clatters
to the ground Old Joe drags him to the window They look
out Nothing in the parking lot Too quiet

OLD JOE

Joe punches Old Joe square in the jaw and he goes down His
papers and gun fall The diner door EXPLODES

A GAT MAN barrels in his gat blazing Joe scrambles but Old
Joe gets the gat
With an expert shot Old Joe puts the Gat Man down but there
are two more behind him Pinned behind a booth Old Joe
returns fire glass breaking and chaos
Joe grabs at the papers Old Joe grabs them first and yanks
Leaving Joe with a torn-off top sheet
Joe scrambles away down the length of the diner behind the
booths back to their table as the Gat Men and Old Joe have
their fire fight Joes blunderbuss on the ground beneath
the table He scoops it up Turns and fires at Old Joe

OLD JOE
Shit
Joes blunderbuss hacks another shot and the window behind

Kid Blue squats on his haunches with four more Gat Men

guns trained on the diner door Three Gat Men burst out
followed by Joe

DINER GAT MAN
The back hes running

JOE
Around back

They all run around back where Old Joe is halfway to the
corn but not there yet

The seven Gat Men and Kid Blue and Joe fire their guns after
him while running but theyre too far away (and theyre
running) so nothing hits Joe blasts at the old man blindly
sprinting with all his might eyes streaming tears in the
dust

When Old Joe hits the wall of corn he seems to vanish Four
of the Gat Men follow him in while the remaining pursuers
slow to a stop doubled over panting Defeated

It takes a few seconds for Kid Blue to realize that Joe is
there with them It takes another second for Joe to realize
that the dynamic has changed He turns and runs back towards
the diner Kid Blue and the Gat men in pursuit One of the
Gat Men fires

KID BLUE
Alive No alive
Joe makes it to the Slat Bike jumps on hits the ignition

CLICK

JOE
No fuck no fucking piece of shit
CLICK CLICK The Kid and the Gats closing in and just the
moment that Kid Blue lays his hands on the back of the bike
the engine turns over with a ROAR
The back of the bike kicks up heat and air blasts from the
open slats beneath blowing Kid Blue back on his ass The
bike HOVERS a few feet off the ground
Joe roars off into the corn The Kid is on his feet running
back to the Gat Men
KID BLUE
The tracker Get the tracker

EXT CORN FIELD

Joe riding at full speed through the thick corn stalks He
BAILS snapping through corn stalks and rolling to a painful
stop The bike ZOOMS onward through the stalks quickly out
of sight

Pained Joe lies still breathing hard Pulls Old Joes torn
paper from his pocket On one side the number Old Joe
scribbled 1027363259 He flips it over Its a map

Mostly of empty farm land bisected by a bold highway and
scattered farm houses

One of them is CIRCLED IN BLACK

SARA

EXT FIELD - DAWN

A bare field of churned chocolatey earth Near its edge juts
the dead stump of an old tree

A YOUNG WOMAN in work clothes named SARA chops away at the
trunk with a large axe Over and over splintering it apart
Endless plains of corn surround the field In the near
distance a two story farm house with an adjacent barn

Sara focused on her work as the sun rises

EXT CORN FIELD - EARLY MORNING
Sara fiddles with a garbage can sized DEVICE and with a

crackle of mechanic thrusters it floats up and over the corn
fields spraying something chemical
corn

INT FARM HOUSE KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING
Sara makes coffee
EXT FARM HOUSE PORCH - EARLY MORNING

She sits on a rocking chair and mimes smoking an invisible
cigarette

Our first good look at her face Clear and beautiful but it
has been here for awhile

The morning light changes from steel blue to pale white
Rocking gently fake smoking and drinking coffee Not going
anywhere

INT FARM HOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING

Blinds drawn dark A FIGURE lies in bed Sara steps in
puts her hand on the sleeping figures foot

SARA
Cmon baby Time to get up

INT FARM HOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING
Cooking eggs The front door bangs She looks up
INT FARM HOUSE FOYER

The screen door bangs in the wind Sara inspects it The
latch is broken She sighs
Then freezes

Through the screen door some fifty yards across the front
lawn the dark figure of a MAN stands at the edge of the

fields Watching her

She watches right back for a long moment

Then grabs a shotgun mounted above the door and with no
hesitation at all plows outside

The dark figure vanishes into the corn fields

EXT FARMHOUSE FRONT LAWN
Sara storms down the porch and stalks across the lawn
shotgun extended Not fucking around

Does not slow her pace until she is ten yards from the corn
fields where she plants herself and shouts

SARA
Listen up fucker I have shot and
buried three vagrants in the past
year If you want to know the
Christs honest truth Im starting
to get a taste for it So I dont
care what hobo sob story youve
got I get a dozen a week and it
cuts no cash with me Its me and
my husband here were broke and
angry at our lot in this world and
heavily armed So take some corn
and move on but if you show your
face again I will cut you the fuck
in half
Silence Just the wind in the corn A long beat Then Sara
turns walks briskly back
Moments later Joes face pokes through the corn stalks He
takes in the farm The barn behind it The fallow field

LATER
Joe sits in the same spot a few feet in the corn but with a
clear sight line at the house
His gun on his knee
JOES FACE - Pale sweating Somethings wrong He winces
Pinches his eyes Headache
The sun pounds down He looks at the piece of map

JOE
Cmon Cmere Cmon Cmon

the street

But the Gat Man steers him back deeper into the alley The
Kid realizes what this means Everything changes

He fights in vain to break from the Gat Mans grip Weeps
begs clasps at whatever he can grab
The Gat Man turns a corner -- towards the alleys dead end

Shrieking Annoyed the Gat Man throws the Kid hard to the
concrete The Gat Man pulls his gun raises it without
ceremony

BANG The Gat Mans face explodes Staggers his gun FIRES
into the wall He drops like a doll

Kid Blue lies in the rain hyperventilating His pant leg
hiked up showing his boot with its holster

In his mangled left hand the small caliber PISTOL he keeps
stashed His pinkie on the trigger

KID BLUE (CONTD)

Oh

Cradling his crushed hand dazed he scampers off like a
soaked rat

pursues her slowly but steadily

He pushes a button on a small plastic box in his hands and
an identical one next to Joe lights up
The way Joe looks at Cid changes slightly

CID (CONTD)
But I need to make it stronger

JOE
How do you do that

CID
Bigger battery
Joe idly fingers a toy

JOE
Smart

CID
Do you kill people
Joe half laughs Cid keeps working his face in shadows

AFTER AWHILE

JOE
Lets say I kill people

CID
With your gun
truck

JOE
Uh huh
Cid looks at him in the dark Not scared at all Then he
goes back to fitting the backing on a toy
A long beat Joe thinking
Broken by a PIERCING NOISE
They both jump - the toy truck Joe has idly played with is
shrieking sirens blaring
Joe fumbles with it Cid reaches over and switches it off
they both freeze
And look up at the ceiling
Silence in the house
With a look of reproach beyond his years Cid takes the

from Joe and finishes up his work

JOE (CONTD)
How long have you and your mom been
on the farm

CID
Shes not my mom My mom got
killed when I was a baby Someone
bad bad men killed her
Cid sets the two finished BUZZERS on the table

JOE
Im sorry

CID
Sara doesnt think I remember cause
I was a baby But I remember my
mom I couldnt stop her getting
killed I dont remember it all
but I remember I was a baby I
couldnt do anything I couldnt
stop it Cause I was a baby
Cid is crying Joe has never been more at a loss

JOE
Im sorry
Takes the buzzers Stands fumbling Retreating

JOE (CONTD)
You should talk to your mom about
this

CID
Shes not my mom Shes a liar
With one last look back at Cid in the dark Joe exits

Icy silence from Sara and an odd stare

SARA
I told you one thing I told you to

JOE
He asked about my gun You think

dont talk to him about it but its
just gonna grow

SARA
Stay out of it Stay the fuck away

She goes back to chopping Joe lingers then leaves She
hacks away

Sara sits with coffee looking out at the fields Deep in
thought
She takes a drag from her pretend cigarette

EXT CHEAP APARTMENT BUILDING - EARLY MORNING

A motel style building Gat Men in cars pass occasionally
with spotlights and radios but the activity has calmed
Old Joe slips around a corner Staying hid Checks the
address on the map 12 Talbott Dr 205

Makes a break for stairs leading to the 2nd level But just
at that moment a car pulls into the buildings lot

Old Joe ducks under the stairs Holding his breath

The car parks Door slams Footsteps A WOMAN Slumping
exhausted up the stairs
by

to

And through the slatted steps Old Joe sees her face flash

It is Suzie the girl from Abes brothel Old Joes face
pure disbelief He recognizes her instantly It cant be
He gingerly steps half a foot out Looking up he can see the
apartment doors above Suzie walks down the landing
Towards apartment 205

Jesus it cant be

Then she passes it Keeps walking Old Joes eyes
relieved

She stops at the next door over knocks It opens vaguely
indistinct conversation between her and the girl that
answers

SUZIE
Sorry I know I promised five you
know how it gets

GIRL NEIGHBOR
Dont worry sugar She was no
problem Gat men searched through
here lookin for god knows
Suzie disappears into the apartment Re-emerges holding a
sleeping 6 year old girl She whispers goodbye to the
neighbor and walks back to APARTMENT 205 She enters

Old Joe frozen Gun in his hand Face numbly a€eYou have

be shitting mea€

He climbs the stairs On the 2nd story landing To 205
Breath held back against the wall Peeks in the window

On the couch Suzie holding her daughter Head in her lap
Stroking her hair Suzies back is to us and with her long
red hair down she is eerily reminiscent of Old Joes wife
Old Joe watches them for a long time

Oddly quiet Old Joe walks down the sidewalk towards the
side entrance to the theater Face uncovered In plain
sight Not caring Stops 30 feet shy of the entrance at a
street garbage can

He draws his gun and leans over to drop it into the can He
lets it dangle from his fingers above the trash can

His pocket watch hanging open from its chain The picture
of his Wife inside Spinning His gun slowly slipping from
his grasp

With each spin of the watch the photo of his Wife appears
cloudier Blurred Indistinct

Gun on the tips of his fingers about to fall Then the
photo is nearly gone

Old Joe staggering to his feet from a fight

Weve seen this before its the IDENTICAL SCENE to the
previous flashback

But when he sees his Wife for the first time whisps of FOG
grow blotting out the scene Deep in the fog are other
backgrounds - a street a house - and unfamiliar faces
Other eventualities clouding this one as it becomes less
likely Old Joe will meet his wife and have this memory
Erasing it

decision

Sara lies in bed Eyes wide open Still and quiet in the
dark Her hand moves over her bare leg Slides across the
sheets Finds the Frog Buzzer lying next to her

A moment of hesitation Then she pushes it

sound a door opening in the house below

Quick footsteps approaching Her eyes follow them The door
flies open Joe gun in hand buzzer in the other His eyes
adjust to the dark

Closes the door kisses him The adrenaline in his head
doesnt know where to go

SARA
Dont wake Cid
She pulls him to the bed lifting his shirt off The rain
starts to fall against the windows

LATER
Lying beside each other Joe still stunned
Sara smokes a real cigarette taking a deep joyful drag She
sets the lighter on her palm It floats about a foot in the
air spinning then drops

JOE
Thats pretty good

In the city young guys would hit
on me by floating fucking quarters
I wouldnt tell da€™em I was TK but
Id keep their quarters down One
guy busted a blood vessel in his
eye trying to get it up

leveled at him Cid makes a strange shouting noise falls

Old Joe pushes the door open Blackness within
INT FARMHOUSE FOYER LIVING ROOM

The room darkens As if the sun passed behind a cloud
Jesse realizes its a kid Lowers his gun But Cid is mid-
scream falling back his foot misses the step and he

down the stairs

Confused terrified falling Joe runs into the foyer to
catch Cid Sara runs behind him

The room is very dark now Knick-knacks around the room
rattle then LIFT INTO THE AIR All of them Floating
Spinning Saras LIGHTER on the coffee table it RISES
into the air

INT APARTMENT 205

Old Joe readies his gun staring into the blackness But his
eyes lower He touches his temple Remembering

INT FARMHOUSE FOYER LIVING ROOM (OLD JOES MEMORIES)

Fog clears - Joe is almost to Cid who is still tumbling
nearly at the bottom of the stairs

INT FARMHOUSE FOYER LIVING ROOM (NORMAL)

But just before he reaches him Sara shoves Joe from behind
Shoving him TOWARDS THE FRONT DOOR Hes confused but her
face is set

Cid hits the hardwood floor of the foyer face contorted

rage now hand raised to Jesse palm outstretched
Screaming His scream louder than it should be

Bigger things in the living room RISE OFF THE GROUND
Chairs The couch And Jesse He rises five feet in the

air terrified

Sara pulls Joe through the front door and he looks back and
sees Jesse suspended in the air and Cid on the ground
screaming like an animal and just as they cross the
threshold Jesse explodes in a bright red fan of blood

Old Joes face Remembering

A bare bulb hanging from the ceiling turns on
A six year old girls room But the only person in it is Kid

defeated

into Kid Blue SLAMMING him against the opposite wall
Old Joe grabs (behind his back) Kid Blues gun and blasts
one shot through the chains binding his wrists and into the
Kids midsection
He whips the gun from behind his back and shoots Big Craig

the face Then blasts the Gat Men in the entrance hallway
while he reaches into the coat check and pulls an automatic
rifle

He blasts like hell into the hallway A few shots return but
mostly the men are trapped Then its over All is smoky
still for a moment

Old Joe stares at the exit door ajar down the long hallway
jammed with bodies Then at the passage that leads deeper
into the club

A Gat Man runs in and Old Joe shoots him down

He steps into the coat check and loads his pockets with guns
and grenades Then launches himself into passageway towards
the club

Old Joe weaves his way through the backstage area chucking
grenades in front of him then unloading his automatic rifle
into the smoky aftermath

Joe waits Then a CLOUD OF DUST on the distant highway He
tenses The cloud gets closer It is a truck An armored
truck

Joe squints Its the ARMORED TRUCK that Kid Blue loaded his
gold bricks into The front windshield blown in

The truck stops fifty feet away and Old Joe steps out He
throws a gold bar which lands in the dusty highway between
them

OLD JOE

Joe fires again close enough now to draw blood off Old

chest and knock him back

Out of nowhere a SLAT BIKE careens around the van which has
until now blocked our line of sight down the highway

Kid Blue
The bike clips Joes leg sending him spinning violently to
the dusty pavement
The bike shoots off down the highway a cloud of dust in its
wake It takes a hundred yards for the Kid to pull it toa
stop and spin it around
Joe is hurt bad He grapples for his blunderbuss

id Blue guns the engine gat in hand Levels it steady as
a rock
Joe shoots at the Kid but hes out of range the gun fires
scattershot

Panicked Joe begins firing at the pavement around him

after fiery round

of dust and smoke He fires his gat into the cloud tries to
slow the bike but cant in time
In the dust cloud Joe hears the bike roaring down upon him

He covers up and when he feels the bike roaring past blindly
FIRES his buss

A moment later the bike emerges from the dust cloud Without
a driver It skids crashes

When the dust clears away Joe lies still arms over his

Painfully Joe raises himself Then realizes
Old Joe is gone

glance off the overturned truck

Revealing that all we saw was in Joes head and we are

in the moment where Old Joe is about to shoot Sara
