INT BEDROOM RENTED HOUSE DUBLIN - DAY 1
FACE of a working-class woman from Dublin SANDRA KELLY Decent looking if she bothered young but tired - a Mother

She has a BIRTHMARK on one of her eyes Both are now closed
she’s being “styled” by her daughters -

EMMA 8 vivacious chatty and MOLLY 6 old soul quieter
They wear party-dresses lip-gloss glitter on their cheeks

EMMA plaits Sandra’s hair perfectly MOLLY dusts her brush
in the eye-shadow palette and whispers -

MOLLY
I’m gonna do your eyes now

SANDRA
Okay Cool

MOLLY pauses delicately touches her birthmark

MOLLY
What d’ya call that again

SANDRA’s smile belies the amount of times she’s been asked
EMMA

Molly you know it’s her birthmark
Why d’you always ask

MOLLY
Why do you have it and nobody else
Mam

SANDRA

I’ve already told you love I was
just born with it

I was in God’s pocket -

EMMA here we go again MOLLY never tiring of this story

SANDRA (CONTD)
He had me in his Art Shop and He
said “In case I need to find you
I’m giving you a special mark”

She peeks an eye open to see EMMA mouthing along

GARY’s steel cap boot rages down A sickening crunch Her
hand under his boot Crushing it An agonized howl Silence

That wrecked HAND in a tube-grip trembling struggling to
insert a hotel key-card

(Sandra’s other good hand is carrying shopping and laundry

EMMA holds the St Brigid Cross retelling the myth her way

EMMA

So Brigid prays to God and says God
will you make the King of Ireland’s
heart all soft ‘cos it’s gone icy
and like a rock or something and
God did and she smiled and said to
the King Will you give me as much
land as this cloak will cover

Herself (April 26 - Yellow)

SANDRA pricks up and is drawn in by the story

EMMA (CONTD)
‘Cos she was wearing this cloak
just normal size and he starts
laughing his head off ‘cos he
thinks she’s mad But she bends
down and the cloak is magic with
the Holy God spirit in it and she
tells her four sisters with her -
they’re like her sidekicks right -
they take a corner each and spread
it out over the land they’re on
and they do and it goes out for
miles and he can’t believe it
it’s a mirkle - a mir-a-cle And he
goes ‘Brigid what’s the story
how did you do that’ And she says
‘It’s ‘cos you’re being so stingy
and all to the poor people in your
land’ and then he says ‘Alright ya
can have loads of me land’

SANDRA moved and soothed by this bedtime tale

EMMA (CONTD)
And she gets it and starts a
convent and helps all the people in
the town and they start a farm
where they make jam with the
berries on the land and then
everyone was grand

SANDRA
(applauds )
Bualadh bos How’d ya remember all
that

EMMA
I don’t like the way me teacher

takes in the photos the sums

SANDRA (CONT’D)

I cost you 33 thousand euro in rent
and welfare in one year alone

(beat)
And at number 653 on the housing
list that could mean keeping us in
hotels for the next three four
years at leastcosting you 120
grand maybe more But if you let
me use a site I could have this
built by Christmas - and then just
be paying you rent for the house
Do you see what I mean

SANDRA sits in the witness-box

GARY and his SOLICITOR female 30s ironed into her suit
sit across from SANDRA’S SOLICITOR JO from Women’s Aid sits
behind

JUDGE MCBRIDE
I see there were a few years of
this “ongoing threatening
behaviour” Ms Kelly

SANDRA
Yes Judge

JUDGE MCBRIDE
Was there a reason you didn’t leave
sooner

SANDRA
I did try to I wanted to loads
of times - I made a safety-box I
just had nowhere to go

The JUDGE weighs this and looks to GARY

Herself (April 26 - Yellow) 82

JUDGE MCBRIDE
Mr Mullen - you claim that Molly
hasn’t attended access on eight
occasions

GARY
Yes judge

JUDGE MCBRIDE
Youve been keeping up maintenance

GARY
Yes judge

JUDGE MCBRIDE
Okay Ms Breen

SOLICITOR
Thank you Judge Ms Kelly last
time we spoke you described
suffering “psychological and
physical abuse throughout your
relationship” is that correct

SANDRA
Yes

SOLICITOR
And when I specifically asked you
whether Mr Mullen had ever harmed
your children you said “no” Is
that correct

SANDRA
Yes

SOLICITOR
Do you believe he’s harmed them on
access visits

SANDRA

SOLICITOR
Your honour we have new evidence
to bring to court
(as it’s presented)
Articles 1 A to C are photos of
the Mr Mullen’s eldest child Emma

SANDRA looks to JO who’s just as surprised
Herself (April 26 - Yellow) 83

SOLICITOR (CONTD)
On Sunday August 7th Emma was
dropped at her father’s place of
residence with a bandage on her
left arm as you can see When
questioned about this Emma said she
hurt it “making something in the
garden with mammy” This didn’t
match what Mr Mullen was told by Ms
Kelly who claimed it happened in
the “hotel” where they temporarily
reside

SANDRA’s now looking at the photo and feeling sick

SOLICITOR (CONTD)
We have evidence that suggests Emma
was indeed “making something in the
garden” of a Dr Margaret O’Toole
- who is in fact allowing Ms Kelly
to build a house at her property

SANDRA
Judge I I can

JUDGE MCBRIDE
Please wait Ms Kelly Ms Breen
what relevance does that have to
this hearing The matter is for
another courtroom

SOLICITOR
Judge if this hearing is about the
character of these parents and
which one is a more suitable
guardian to the children it’s
certainly worth noting that Ms
Kelly did not inform Dublin City
Council about this build or her
change of circumstances -

SANDRA
Dr OToole got planning it’s her
property -

SOLICITOR

And Miss Kelly lied on an
Assessment form

SOLICITOR submits evidence to the JUDGE and a stunned JO
Herself (April 26 - Yellow) 84

SOLICITOR (CONTD)
When asked in June of this year if
youd received a Loan or had Other
Housing options you wrote NA Not
Applicable did you not

SANDRA
I didn’t lie -

SOLICITOR
(deliberately informal)
Well it’s on that form Sandra I
mean it’s hard not to think
youre trying to get two houses
instead of one

SANDRA
(don’t go there)
Oh fuck off

JO wincing

SOLICITOR

Unsafe

JUDGE MCBRIDE
Miss Kelly -

SANDRA
It was a scrape Gary How many
times has she done that coming off

Okay Let’s just for a moment look
at the facts here The report says
Molly missed eight access visits
Mr Mullen hasn’t missed one He’s

paid child maintenance

He’s done everything that was
legally required -

he does what’s required but it’s
not real it’s -

No it’s fact Miss Kelly Whereas
you have not Why is that

A beat She looks at GARY then the JUDGE steely-eyed

SANDRA
Ask me better questions

JUDGE MCBRIDE
I beg your pardon

SANDRA
Ask me why he’s using the children
as pawns in front of us all while
you’s all wondering why I didn’t
fill in a form

Directs this at GARY with conviction until she’s done

SANDRA (CONT’D)
You wanna know why I didn’t let
Molly go Because she was so scared
of seeing you She saw Gary That
day She saw you punch my head and
pull my hair and wreck my hand And
you didn’t see her but she saw
you And you’re calling me to court
because she didn’t want to visit
I can’t make her un-see all that
but Christ I’m her mother and I’11l
listen I’d do it again I’d do it
a million times over Making out
I’m the bad Mam a bad person I
put her first I always put our
kids first

He’s inscrutable Doesn’t give her the reward of a reaction
Sandra turns on the court almost realising in the moment

SANDRA (CONT’D)

Theyre the reason I finally left
I’m done saying sorry I’m done
You all knew what he did to me -
from the Medical and Garda reports
“facts” Judge - and you still put
me through this still asking me
“Why didn’t you leave him” You
never asked “why didn’t he stop”

from a playground a tumble on the
street But it didn’t Ms Kelly
It happened in your care

SANDRA tenses Sees GARY thinking this is in the bag

JUDGE MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
- albeit while you were in the
process of building a house to
secure their future

She takes in SANDRA and GARY and closes the case-file

JUDGE MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
I order the children to be assessed
in the coming months to establish
their needs what they truly want
But for now no custody to Mr
Mullen The terms of access remain

hand yes GARY shakes his head

JUDGE MCBRIDE (CONT’D)
However Ms Kelly

SANDRA
Yes Judge

JUDGE MCBRIDE
You want to build yourself a house
you must take full responsibility
for that You must inform Dublin

proceeds to pick half the toppings off it

SANDRA
Aido what’s the deal with all the
picking You’re the same with your
lunch

AIDO
(mouth full of pizza)
I like things simple I can’t be
doing with fuss
Herself (April 26 - Yellow) 93

SANDRA
Fuss

AIDO
Stop The wife gets on to me to
have vegetables and salad “eat
healthy”

SANDRA
Since the scare

AIDO
Since we wed Every day for thirty-
years the same sandwich and every
day I give the lettuce to the
birds

SANDRA
Would you not just tell her you
don’t like lettuce

AIDO
And let the birds starve
(then tentatively)
So the Mullens didn’t get their way
this time

SANDRA
They didn’t

AIDO
(exhales a ton of relief)
Thank FUCKING Christ - sorry

He nearly punches the air Sandra laughs They share a smile

SANDRA
Everything’s okay

AIDO
Everything’s okay

He puts a hand on her shoulder It’s awkward but well meant
Common soldiers Battle won

AIDO (CONTD)
Id say three more days you could
be in

SANDRA
Seriously

Herself (April 26 - Yellow) 93A

AIDO
Then you can settle up You think
I’m getting paid in pizza

He winks and goes looking for more She smiles then sees a
familiar face coming down the garden path with a large pot -

ROSA
Heard about the session I made
Feijoada

Aido already grimacing at the idea of that dish

SANDRA
Brilliant Come on I get you a
drink

EXT GARDEN PEGGYS HOUSE - DAY 143

The new-build house at dusk Music plays within Hold this
longer than we might expect It’s almost unsettling

Then laughter

SANDRA piggy-backs EMMA out (Emma’s a bit more hyper than
usual have sipped some bubbles) DARIUSZ cradles sleepy

MOLLY and the others follow cans in hand deep in chat
keen to carry on

Light’s fading kids are wrecked the party’s moving inside

INT LIVING ROOM PEGGYS HOUSE - NIGHT 144

PEGGY “hosts” ensuring glasses are full and people are fed
Then Peggy pulls the blinds on the windows onto the garden

AIDO tunes a guitar FRANCIS takes in Peggy’s oriental art
and cracks up (finds it very bold)

TOMO DARIUSZ and YEWANDE lounge on a sofa tipsy already

JO holding a tray of sandwiches chatting to AMY who is
Herself (April 26 - Yellow) 94

embracing her into the fold Chat and banter in full flow
We hear
YEWANDE
I never did stuff like this when I

was younger I’ve got so used to
having it to look forward to now

SANDRA
(in)
Same

She’s perched on a nearby stool formal jacket from court
off hair down and for once chilling SANDRA sees ROSA

coming downstairs miming ‘fast asleep’ Sandra nods
Herself (April 26 - Yellow) 95

AIDO lifts his can for toast

AIDO

ListenehI just wanted to say
It’s been a long time since I did
anything more than an odd job And
what’s been done here makes me very
proud -

(cups Francis’ ears)
And puts me in mind of an old Irish
term a Meitheal

TOMO
A meth-head

AIDO gets him in a playful headlock

AIDO
A Meitheal Francis explain to the
young ones what it is while I put
some manners on this eejit

FRANCIS
A Meitheal is when people come
together to help their own

AIDO
And are helped in return Slainte

All raise a glass united and changed by this experience
TIME CUT TO
Later It’s turned into a lively session

AIDO plays guitar FRANCIS the bodhran YEWANDE claps along
TOMO gently twirls PEGGY DARIUSZ jigs with AMY and ROSA

While SANDRA watches smiling feeling like she can breathe
again Closing her eyes she starts to sing a cappella

As SANDRA cuts loose the others stop dancing and playing to
listen and take her in

This is the real Sandra Kelly

She closes her eyes and sings her heart out uninhibited
144A

144B

Herself (April 26 - Yellow) 96
Eventually she opens her eyes and sees MOLLY at the door
quivering trying to get the words out Finally -

MOLLY
Black Widow Black Widow Mam

SANDRA stops All eyes are on MOLLY repeating Black Widow

INT HALLWAYKITCHEN - NIGHT 144A

SANDRA bolts down the corridor and bursts into the kitchen
only to tense

The light from the flames glows through the linen curtains
colouring her face orange red

Her darkest fears The house she built is on fire Falling
apart

SANDRA
No NO

OMITTED 144B

EXT GARDEN PEGGYS HOUSE - NIGHT 145
Flames

Huge gushing flames

And the cruel crashing sound of walls tumbling

SANDRA dashes out screaming crying animal-like

AIDO rushes after her FRANCIS is not far behind his minder

PEGGY watches distressed faint YEWANDE sees this steadies
her

ROSA’s on her phone pleading hurry
AMY’s in tears yelling at Sandra to get back

SANDRA tries to get to the house only to recoil the heat is
intense

AIDO grabs her and tries to haul her away She clings to his
shirt Begs Screams
Herself (April 26 - Yellow) 96A

Until FRANCIS TOMO and DARIUSZ pull them both back

SANDRA kneels as the house goes up heart breaking sobbing
All look on aghast as the burning house folds in on itself
BLACK

SILENCE

Herself (April 26 - Yellow) 97

WHITE

EXT GARDEN PEGGY’S HOUSE - DAY 146
Ash Ruin A wasteland

The only thing left of the house is a portion of the frame
where the front door was

INT BEDROOM PEGGYS HOUSE - DAYNIGHT 147
Ashen-faced SANDRA lying on her side sedated

At various points food appears but gets left

EMMA and MOLLY cuddle-up but they are ignored

Her belongings (from the hotel) are brought in and neatly
stacked below the window but she’s oblivious

PEGGY ROSA JO and AMY sit with her update her offer
condoling words but she doesn’t hear them

YEWANDE TOMO and DARIUSZ check in with PEGGY respectful
inquiring nodding etc but not disrupting Sandra

AIDO and FRANCIS stand in the doorway looking in FRANCIS
has brought flowers AIDO pale with grief and tired anger
almost in it with her

Day turns to night

SANDRA groans in her sleep twitching only to wake thrown
scared and soaked with sweat She curls into a ball trying
to shake the dream

INT STAIRCASE PEGGYS HOUSE - DAY 148
Stairs The upstairs landing leading to Peggy’s spare room
A beat then the sound of loss Low anguished a howl from
the pit of the stomach

INT BEDROOM PEGGYS HOUSE - DAY 149

SANDRA sobbing quaking with grief at the loss of Gary her
house hope of a new start

FADE TO BLACK
Herself (April 26 - Yellow) 97A

150 EXT DUBLIN - DAY 150

Buildings and building work all over town

Herself (April 26 - Yellow) 98

New hotels luxury-apartment blocks swanky offices gated-
estates renovations restorations

So much construction But so little housing

INT BEDROOM PEGGYS HOUSE - DAY 151

Sunlight streams through the windows SANDRA stirs hollowed
and cried out only to see a silhouette of a small woman in
the armchair Her eyes adjust to see -

TINA Gary’s Mum sitting beside her Nervous Heartbroken

TINA

He’s been arrested Sandra - Gary
He’s in custody He’ll go down for
a long time You’re safe

(fills up regrets)
What he did to youthere’s no
excuse When he was a child he
learnt well what could be done
inside four walls with no one
watching butI knew I just
didn’t want to believe and when
I heard you were building that
house - and god bless him he’s my
only son - but I thought Thank
God

(beat)
I have to stay with my one

(beat)
You don’t

(looks at her)
He’s set himself on fire not you
It doesn’t matter what walls you’re
between now It’s over
Youre free

Beat then she gets up and goes
SANDRA a flicker of something Then her eyes close again

FADE TO BLACK

INT BEDROOM PEGGYS HOUSE - (NEXT) DAY 152
PEGGY opens the curtains and the September sun warms SANDRA

PEGGY
Time to get up Sandra
Herself (April 26 - Yellow) 98A

SANDRA won’t Can’t So PEGGY levers an arm under her and
raises her up

Herself (April 26 - Yellow) 99
PEGGY (CONTD)
I made you tea Have a little sip

SANDRA doesn’t react So PEGGY puts the cup to her lips and
encourages her to drink

PEGGY (CONT’D)
Good woman Can you stand

SANDRA is too weak So PEGGY pulls back the duvet swings her
legs out and fixes a look

PEGGY (CONT’D)
Now grip And up we go Deadly

Flicker of recognition Then PEGGY walks SANDRA very slowly
out
INT HALLWAYKITCHEN PEGGY’S HOUSE - DAY 153

PEGGY follows SANDRA downstairs through the hallway into
the kitchen

GRAINNE’s preparing tea She smiles at SANDRA

SANDRA sits in a chair staring out into the garden Peggy
puts Sandra’s blackened safety boots down in front of her
feet

EXT GARDEN PEGGYS HOUSE - DAY 154

Sandra walks down the lawn PEGGY at her side

Steeling herself SANDRA walks round the hedge to the rear
garden where her house was only to halt

Reveal two little girls in hard-hats sinking tools into a
heap of ash MOLLY has a trowel EMMA shovels ash into a
wheelbarrow

But from where SANDRA’s standing it looks like they’re
digging

She takes in her beautiful inspiring daughters Smiles

PEGGY stays put and watches SANDRA wander over to them

EMMA and MOLLY thrilled to see her but unsure if she’s
better
Herself (April 26 - Yellow) 100
SANDRA looks for a shovel only to take in her bare hand
realise there’s no support on it
She grips a spade both hands Meets her daughters’ gazes
Out on SANDRA EMMA and MOLLY shovelling the ashes away
