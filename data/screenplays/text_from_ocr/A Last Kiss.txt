down the path lined with ornamental trees toward the driveway
Hers is one of those effortless walks a natural spring in the
step the kind that can crush a mans will under a single
footfall

The WEDDING PARTY crosses her path returning from their photo
session lead by Calypso steel drummers WE FOLLOW the happy
couple and jubilant parents across the lawn until they pass

After you and I had lunch I tried to
think back to when I was happy And I
remember being very happy Sut somehow
I felt I wae missing something and I
found someone else to fill it And as
soon as I did I knew it was a mistake
I just wasnt brave enough to face
that so I blamed your father for
suffocating me When really it was
like one day I just forgot to breathe

beat
Ive looked in Michaels eyes I see
my own TI dont know if your father
should have forgiven me or not I
certainly didnt deserve it And
neither does MichaelMy advice is
listen to him then make up your mind
who he is
