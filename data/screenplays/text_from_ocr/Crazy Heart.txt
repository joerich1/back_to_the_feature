hears the ball drop the steady roll and then the impact

knob of the managers Adams apple and crush it Instead he
touches the mans shoulder and gently squeezes

potatoes and corn A WAITRESS slides into the booth across
the table from him She exhales a long stream of cigarette
smoke over his food

WAITRESS

She winks at him A small row of mascara sticks to her lower
lash She wears a red nylon blouse and a plastic name tag
that says Howdy Im Jo Ann

from the lipstick

As Bad crosses to the stage carrying his guitar and tweed
vintage FENDER amp a rockabilly version of Bads I Dont

him Tony and the Renegades stop as they see him approach
though the drummer continues to pound for a few more beats

Bad unsnaps his case
BAD
This is it A 59 Gretsch with an
action that would put a twenty year-
old whore to shame
Bad looks to their heavy stacked Marshall amps
BAD (CONTD)
If youre playing loud enough to
drown out my amp youre playing

chords Bad digs through his case

Tony looks to the Renegades and then back to Bad

TONY

Bad looks to Tony and then begrudgingly obliges

BAD
Its just some of that cajun patois
steel-bendin stuff

The boys look at one another as Bad starts in on one of his
greatest hits I Dont Know He runs through a break full
of hammers and pulls the style he taught Tommy and that has
become Tommys signature

TONY (CONTD)
Im not sure I think Tommy plays
it more like this

Tony begins the song again throwing in double and triple
pulls trilling the high notes The Renegades join in
bombastically

TONY (CONTD)
I think thats more the sort of
thing he does now Thats the way
we like to play it

BAD
Keep working on that because
someday Tommy will be playing this
very bowling alley Youll all
still be here and you can buy each
other drinks get drunk and be a

Bad struggles across the parking lot carrying his guitar in
one hand and his amp in the other Hes an aging man dressed
in his signature black boot-cut slacks vest and white shirt

At the back door Tony and the Renegades are lounging
cooling off between sets They watch Bad lurch across the
parking lot No one offers help

Bads wheezing hard The air is sharp with marijuana as Bad
watches a joint go from hand to hand

area The band moves into an up-tempo version of Somebody
Else

At the end of the first chorus Tony moves to the microphone

TONY
Ladies and gentlemen the Spare
Room is proud to present country
recording star The Wrangler of
Love Mr Bad Blake

Bad steps forward to where the light is supposed to be on
but misjudges Only his guitar is in the light He takes a
step into the light and swings into his jazzy melody simple
but quick and light full of triplets that sound harder to
play than they really are

a round of warm applause Bad starts in on the same solo His
musicianship is smoother more efficient and much more
masterly Tony meekly steps back downstage as Bad finishes
the guitar lesson The crowd roars their approval
