PADE IN DURING

the distant sound of a great clock telling the hour

On a white field we see the twisted silhouette of a
demon CAMERA moving down shows this to be cast from
a tree from the window outside The curtains full‘ of
moonlight are blowing in the wind A beautiful girl
is lying in bed (HARZ) Her eyes are open She is
counting the hours as the clock strikes Something in
the sound of it makes her wince with pain On the

sound track (filtered) breathing like the wind itself
over the strange light music we hear the voice of a
MAN

MANS VOICE (RANKINS)
Its beautifulIts beautiful
that waThrough the woods over -
the little brook and through the
cemetery eee

DISSOLVE TO
EXTERIV LONGSTREET HOME NIGHT

The terrace is bright with moonlight Slowly the
Prench doors from the living room open and the girl
comes out She is fully dressed She carries a
small package under one am CAMERA follows her as
she moves across the terrace - across the lawn and
off towards the fields and woods stretching into the
distance A gast of wind blows the door shut with
a loud bang

EXTERIOR WOODS NIGHT

A ghostly figure under the moon the girl emerges

from the shadows of the trees and reaches a little
stream at the edge There is no hesitation as she
crosses on the stepping stones only grim determination
Reachingthe opposite bank she hurries on towards the
church whose spire points toward the moon in the middle
distance
EXTERIOR THE CEMETERY NIGHT

Unhesitatingly the girl picks her way through the rows
of tombstones Again she hears weirdly through the
faint complaint of the wind a mans voice

Ahead of her looms the church its rear deor plainly
in view For a moment she hesitates then contimes

INTERIOR CHURCH NIGHT

It is full of ghostly shadows and ominous half-tones
from the moonlight diffused through the stained glass
Windows ‘The girl enters the empty church She moves
down the sidé aisle and ges across a row of pews and
goes down the center aisle toward the open door leading
into the vestibule

INTERIOR VESTIBULE WIGHT

The girl holding her package very carefully begins to
mount toward the belfry CAMERA stays on her as she
climbs She comes finally to a ladder One ef its
rungs is missing With her free hand the giri grasps
what still stands upright and continues on - up into
the velfry

DISSOLVE TO
A TOWN SQUARE NEW ENGLAND WIGHT
Townspeeple are gathering under the moonlight -- men and
women alike They carry shotguns rakes baseball bats -
any kind of hastily gathered weapon of protection Some
are in various stages of hasty dressing All are moving
toward the church
EXTERTJR CHURCH NIGHT NEW ANGLE

The townspeople are converging on the church from all
airections —

EXTERIOR CHURCH NIGHT STILL ANOTHER ANGLE
A plercing scream is heard

The scream is so high that it is impossible to tell
whether 1t was uttered by a man or woman Dimly on
the ledge below the clock we see high above us two
figures apparently locked in a death struggle It ta
difficult to see mich in the shadows but it looks as
though these figures are respectively male and female
A kuge gasp breathes from the crowd below as the two
figures seeming to clutch at each other teeter and
fall toward us through the darkness CAMERA swoops
down with this but we cannot see the figures fall to
earth They arc blocked off by the backs of the
townspeople which now are silhouetted sharply against
the sky and low excited muttering runs through the
crowd then votces are distinguishable New England

FIRST VOICE

(gnoring her question)
Ive not finished Mrs Rankin In
prison ‘in Czechoslovakia a creature
named Meinike was awaiting execution
Meinike was the one-time executive
officer of Walther Kuhn He wes an
obscenity on the face of the earth
The meill cof turning flesh was in his
clothes We gave him his freedom on
the chance that he might lead ma to
Kubn He led me here Mrs Rankin
And here I lost himuntil yesterday
Your dog Red found him for me But
unfortunately Meinike was dead and buried
eeMeinike had found Kuhn and Kuhn had
murdered him because he was afraid that
Meinie was a threat to his own safety
Tater he murdered Red because Red also
had become a threat Nor in ali the
world there is only one person who can
identity Walther Kuhn That person is
the one who knowsknows positivéely
who Meinike came to Harper to see

You see Judge Longstreet its
