41999 SHOOTING DRAFT

1 EXT OUTER SPACE

The vastness of space Suddenly a hole in the sky opens with a
flash and a SPACESHIP rumbles into view ON its hull the letters
NSEA PROTECTOR Magnificent though on closer inspection it
shudders ever so slightly denoting pre-CGI model work on a
budget Were watching a TV show

LAREDO (V0)
Were exiting the time knot now sir

2 INT NSEA PROTECTOR COMMAND DECK - SPACE

5 Members of the crew of the NSEA PROTECTOR sit in the large
circa - 1979-high-tech cabin All of them human except for DR
LAZARUS a purple reptilian-looking alien LAREDO is 9 The
crewmates exchange relieved smiles

FRED
Were alive

LAREDO
We made it Commander we made it

LAZARUS (THE ALIEN)
By Grabthars hammer we live to tell the tale

COMPUTER (0S)
Systems register functional

GWEN
All systems are working Commander Commander
They all turn to look at THE COMMANDER who turns to reveal
himself dramatically Good looking His acting is classic
Charlton Heston take-no-prisoners style He looks around the
command deck worried almost sniffing the air

COMMANDER

I dont like it It was too easy Look for ambient energy
fields

LAREDO
All normal sir The entire spectrum

COMMANDER
Check again Laredo

LAREDO
Yes sir I- Wait Oh no

His radar lights up with dots First a few then HUNDREDS

LAREDO
Theyre everywhere There are time knots opening everywhere

LAZARUS
IMPACT NOW Commander

Suddenly an EXPLOSION rocks the ship

GWEN
A trap

LAZARUS
Were surrounded Commander The entire 5k Ranking is out there

COMMANDER
Our plasma armor

LAREDO
Gone sir

Another BLAST rocks the room

COMPUTER (OS)
Structural damage at 68 percent

GWEN
Were getting major structural damage

FRED
Its a core meltdown sir It cant be stopped

The Commander turns to his advisor Lazarus

LAZARUS
Commander surrender may be our only option
COMMANDER

No never give up NEVER surrender
GWEN
The reactor has eaten through four levels Six levels The

ship is disintegrating

LAREDO
Your orders sir Sir your orders

The Commander walks into close up Steely determination

COMMANDER
Activate the Omega 13

The crewmates exchange expectant and terrified glances CLOSE UP
of a crewmans hand as he operates a series controls which in
turn opens five layers of mechanical locks revealing a serious
looking lever The Commander pulls that lever A MACHINE Is
revealed rising from the floor in the middle of the room It
begins to GLOW Cut to each actor in turn reacting dramatically
Then suddenly THE PICTURE GOES WHITE LEADER LEADER NUMBERS
APPEAR with a STUDIO COPYRIGHT notice

CUT TO

3 HUNDREDS OF FACES

ENTHRALLED LEGIONS of mostly spotty faced male adolescent FANS
staring into camera For a moment all is silent A few are
sobbing Then a BURST OF THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE Were at a
SCIENCE FICTION CONVENTION The enthusiastic crowd of FANS
continue cheering as the master of ceremonies GUY takes the
stage

GUY
Well there you are You are the first people to see the lost
GALAXY QUEST episode 52 two parter since it was originally aired
in 82 As most of you know no concluding episode was filmed
when the series was cancelled so one episode was never included
in the syndication run Lets hear it for Travis Latke who
actually rescued the footage from the studio garbage Can you
believe that

(Latke stands fans cheer)

Now for the moment youve all been waiting for The intrepid
crew of the

NSEA PROTECTOR

But a STAGEHAND in the wings signals for Guy to stretch
GUY
But first What is a hero Lets take a look at a few more

clips

4 BACKSTAGE
Here we meet the REAL LIFE ACTORS all dressed as their TV alter
egos GWEN DEMARCO beautiful in a sexy and improbable body
suit ALEXANDER DANE (DR LAZARUS) wearing green alien
prosthetic makeup FRED KWAN calm sitting on an

apple box reading the paper TOMMY LAREDO WEBBER the youngest

GWEN
The guy is terminally selfish

FRED

GWEN AND TOMMY

FRED

TOMMY
And he ate Freds SANDWICH

Gwen turns to notice Alexander staring into a makeup mirror eyes
roaming over his alien green makeup and scaly rubber features

with a mournful expression

GWEN
Oh Alex get away from that thing

ALEXANDER
Dear God How did I come to this

5499 (GOLDENROD)

GWEN

I repeated the computer Its getting hotter Commander The
ship is disintegrating Commander Nothing I did EVER affected

TOMMY

Malaysian named Laredo HELLO

Suddenly the rear stage doors open and JASON NESMITH (The
Commander) strolls in all exuberance and charm

JASON

My friends your Commander has arrived Am I too late for
Alexanders panic attack(looks at Alex) Apparently so
(inspects a mole on Alexs neck) Thats irregular you should

Oh what did I do now

5 CONVENTION STAGE On the stage Guy continues to stall
GUY

- Sure the rocks looked hollow and the sets moved when anyone
humped into them But we didnt care
FILM CLIPS are projected behind him On an alien planet THE
Commander carries the LIMP BODY OF HIS ADVISOR LAZARUS ray guns
erupting around him On the command deck the crew fights a
space battle with crack precision TEAMWORK

GUY

For those four seasons from 79 to 82 we the viewers
developed the same affection for the crew of the NSEA PROTECTOR
that the crew had for each other These werent just
adventurers exploring space these were friends

6 BACKSTAGE - The others surround JASON fighting

TOMMY
You said we do appearances together or not at all

JASON

always work together Thats what I said

GWEN
Unbelievable

TOMMY

JASON
A few fans built a little set in their garage I come in for
an hour at most Its a nothing

5499 (GOLDENROD)

GWEN
How much of a nothing Not enough to split five ways kind of a
nothing

JASON
What do you want me to say Gwen They wanted the Commander

Suddenly bright light streams in They all turn to see ALEXANDER
skulking out the exit A beat then they all run to catch
Alexander TACKLING HIM

7 ONSTAGE -

Guy gets a thumbs up cue from a stagehand and begins to introduce
the cast to the delight of the applauding FANS

GUY
Okay here we go Lets hear a warm welcome for crack

Tommy comes bounding out with a big smile his hair mussed
Behind him is a film clip of young LAREDO in action

The stage trained British actor

ALEX AS LAZARUS ONSCREEN

Alex cringes desperately unhappy

GUY
And finally my fellow Questarians the brave Commander of the
NSEA PROTECTOR Peter Quincy Taggart JASON NESMITH

Jason appears and a SPOTLIGHT follows him

TOMMY
Unbelievable He rented a SPOT

Jason raises his fist encouraging the FANS to cry out

JASONJASON ON SCREENEVERYONE
NEVER GIVE UP NEVER SURRENDER DAMN THE RESONANCE CANNONS
FULL SPEED AHEAD

The fans go crazy The actors exchange glances

GUY
The Commander and his crew will be signing autographs on imperial
decks b and c near the coke machines

2 CONVENTION HALLWAY

Its quiet Were on FOUR PAIRS OF BOOTS walking down the
hallway We PAN UP to reveal FIVE SERIOUS LOOKING YOUNG PEOPLE
4 men and a woman clean cut as Disneyland employees and
impeccably outfitted in GALAXY QUEST style uniforms Something
odd about them you cant quite put your finger on For now well
refer to them as THE PECULIAR FANS

3 CONVENTION HALL

We move with the PECULIAR FANS as they enter the bustling
convention floor making their way past the numerous FANS dressed
as their favorite GALAXY QUEST characters through the various
booths selling GALAXY QUEST and other Si-fi memorabilia catching
snippets of conversation along the way They pass two
ELABORATELY COSTUMED ALIEN FANS talking

ALIEN

-Yeah I used to De Garknor of Ang but I got a rash from the
chest pads so now Im Sacnod from episode 5 which is fine except
the transducer pinches when I sit down

They pass a group of particularly EARNEST FANS at a vendors
booth also costumed as the five GALAXY QUEST leads Their
leader BRANDON WHEEGER inspects a sellers model of the
DEFENDER contemptuously

BRANDON
The tail fin is concave not convex The proton reactor is where
the influx thermistors should be and my god is this Testors

blue green number six on the hull
(drops the model roughly)
I I This is a complete abortion

With curious glances to this similarly uniformed group the
PECULIAR FANS move past then come to a halt as they spot JASON
up on a raised platform at the front of the hall signing
autographs for a long line of fans The peculiar fans stare at
Jason as to they were in the presence of God They exchange
astonished smiles then start toward him

THE CAST TABLE

Tommy Alexander and Fred sign autographs at a row of tables near
Jason but significantly lower than his perch

TOMMY
Is it me or does his table get higher every convention

One of many fans dressed as Dr Lazarus steps up to Alexander
and salutes him with crossed fists

FAN
By Grabthars hammer by the suns of Warvan I shall avenge

you

Alexander ignores this grabs the photo from his hand signs it
thrusts it back The next fan steps up

FAN
By Grabthars hammer by the-

He signs and thrusts it back before he can even finish

ALEXANDER
Next

Guy (the MC) approaches the actors at their tables

GUY
Hi everybody

TOMMY

Hey Thanks for one nice intro uh

GUY

Guy You probably dont remember me do you (They stare

blankly) I was on the show in 82 Episode 31 Got killed by
the lava monster before the first commercial Crewman 6

The actors pretend that they remember him oh right Guy

GUY
Listen I was wondering would you guys mind if I sit in today
See if anybodys interested in an autograph Never know

GWEN
Sure Guy If you can stand the excitement

Two more FANS dressed as Alexanders character approach him
proudly CHATTERING at him in the Maktar language

ALEXANDER
Dont make me get a restraining order

ACROSS THE ROOM

THE PECULIAR FANS are making their way through the crowd toward
Jason We suddenly notice something very strange THE LEFT HAND
of the tallest one is flickering between a normal hand and A HAND
WITH SEVEN LONG BLUE TENTACLES FOR FINGERS The LEADER notices
and motions to the afflicted man who raps sharply against a metal
blinking box on his belt The hand becomes normal again He looks
up nods at the leader From now on well refer to these 5 as THE
ALIENS

AT THE CAST TABLE - Guy now sits with the others forlorn No
fans are in line for his autograph He watches as Fred fields
questions from the group or fans led by BRANDON

BRANDON

Mr Kwan In episode nineteen when the reactor fused you used
an element from Leopold Six to fix the quantum rockets What was
that called

FRED
Bivrakium

BRANDON
The blue sheath it was encased in-

FRED
A bi-thermal krevlite housing

5499 (GOLDENROD)

Brandon makes a note thanks him and exits with his group
GUY
How do you remember this stuff

FRED
Oh I make it up Use lots of ks and vs

A male FAN moves up to Gwen hands her a picture to sign

FAN
Im a big fan Ms Demarco

Gwen looks at the photo nonplussed

GWEN
You really expect me to sign a naked picture of myself This
isnt even my body

FAN
Yeah normally with fakes its like recycle bin But This
ones really good

(Gwen sighs starts to sign)
Could you not write over the Thanks

A fan finally approaches Guy who looks up eagerly The fan looks
at him quizzically trying to place him

GUY
Episode 12 (gets no reaction) Killed by the lava monster

FAN
(turns to Tommy)
Laredo could I get an autograph

Guy shrugs disappointed Gwen gives him a comforting look then
looks across at

JASON ON HIS PERCH

Talking dramatically to a group of fans A YOUNG BOY watches WIDE
EYED

JASON
» On one hand if I had moved an inch the beast would have
killed me On the other hand my crew was in danger

YOUNG BOY
How did you know what to do

5499 (GOLDENROD)

JASON
Without a crew Im not a Commander

He pulls down on the kids cap

JASON
And we all know what happened to that beast on Enok 7
The fans make happy nerdy we sure do noises
CASTMEMBERS TABLE

Gwen shakes her head appreciatively

GWEN
You gotta admit they do love him

TOMMY
Almost as much as he loves himself

They watch as Jason fields another question from a fan

JASON
Im glad you asked To me the most important qualities of a
Galaxy Explorer are loyalty

ALEXANDER
to camera center no matter whose shot youre blocking

JASON
Leadership

TOMMY
to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies
and plenty of them-

JASON
And determination

GWEN
to playing scenes shirtless because the ladies do love
Commander furry

Gwen Alex and the others try to contain their laughter
CLOSER ANGLE - JASONS TABLE

Bored with the constant queries of his fans Jason glances over
to see Gwen smiling at him She quickly looks away self-

42899 (YELLOW)

conscious Jason doesnt even take his eyes off Gwen as BRANDON
steps forward his brow knit with serious matters

BRANDON

Commander please settle a dispute that my crew and I are having
In The Quasar Dilemma the Sentient had taken control of the
ships guidance systems however-

JASON
Excuse me guys
Jason exits Brandon turns to his friends frustrated

BRANDON
I hadnt even gotten to the relevant conundrum

THE CAST TABLE - Gwen answers a question from a shy GIRL

GIRL

Miss Demarco In episode 15 Mist of Delos 5 I got the
feeling you and the Commander kind of had a thing in the swamp
when you were stranded together Did you

GWEN
The Commander and I NEVER had a thing

JASON (0OS)
Thats her story

Gwen looks up to see Jason The girl giggles and exits Jason
smiles at Gwen

GWEN
What

JASON
You smiled at me

Rolling her eves Gwen rises and walks off Undaunted Jason
follows but runs into the five ALIENS Their leader MATHESAR
bows respectfully then follows along as Jason pursues Gwen

MATHESAR
Commander I must speak to you It is a matter of supreme
importance We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula and we

require your help I beseech you to come with us back to our
ship A great many lives hang in the balance

42699 (PINK)

JASON

Right If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the
details with my agent but make sure I have a limo from my house
they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these

MATHESAR
I certainly but-

JASON
Catch me later okay

Jason catches up to Gwen He spins her around dramatically

JASON

Crewman Madison I Im sorry Whatever I do next I have no
control over Its the mist on this strange planet Its filling
my head with such thoughts
He leans in for a tortured kiss Some fans gather delighted by
the impromptu show But Gwen steps aside

GWEN
It was cute when I didnt know you

She exits Jason tries to pretend that doesnt hurt
CONVENTION FLOOR
Jason moves forward introspective amidst the enthusiastic fans

They all shout out questions and comments to him But Jason
pushes past without response and takes refuge in the-

14 MENS ROOM

Jason enters to witness the incongruous sight of four MANKNAR
beasts at the urinals taking a MANKNAR piss Jason enters a
stall and sits on the lid trying to get a moment to think But
two CYNICALIC 20-SOMETHINGS enter laughing their assess off He
can hear their voices echo from the other side

CYNICAL GUY 1
Youre right What a FREAK SHOW This is fricking HILARIOUS

CYNICAL GUY 2

Yeah what a bunch of losers And those poor actors Theyve
done like WHAT for twenty years I think Fred Kwan did a dog
food commercial Sad

5499 (GOLDENROD)

CYNICAL GUY 1

Did you hear Nesmith up there Thats the saddest I think he
actually gets off on these nerds thinking hes space Commander
Its pathetic And his friends

CYNICAL GUY 2
they HATE him I know did you hear them ragging on him
Commander furry

CYNICAL GUY 1
He has no idea that hes a laughingstock Even to his buddies

They exit their laughter ringing in Jasons ears
15 CONVENTION FLOOR - JASONS TABLE

Jason is back at his table signing autographs in a foul mood He
scribbles his name irritably avoiding contact with the fans as
BRANDON and his group of aficionados approach him

BRANDON
Commander as I was saying In The Quasar Dilemma you used
the auxiliary of deck b for Gamma override But online blueprints
indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix so we were
wondering where the error lies

JASON
Its a television show Okay Thats all Its just a bunch of
fake sets and wooden props do you understand

BRANDON
Yes but we were wondering-

JASON
There IS no quantum flux and there Is no auxiliary Theres no
goddamn ship Do you get it

Jason notices that all eyes are turned on him The hall has
become deathly quiet Jason rises abruptly and exits through the
hall Brandon and the fans do their best not to take this
personally

5499 (GOLDENROD)
15A INT GWENS HOUSE

Gwen is cooking something intricate and delicious as she talks to
Alex on the phone Her house is tasteful and bright on a budget

GWEN
I dont know Alex hes never gone quite this far before

15B INT ALEXANDERS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Alexander sits at his kitchen table applying spirit gum remover
to the edges of his alien head appliance

ALEXANDER
Ive said for years hes mentally unstable

He stands and moves to the refrigerator Nothing but a hunk of
very rank cheese which he sniffs disdainfully

ALEXANDER
Oh good theres nothing to eat

GWEN
Why didnt you stop at the market

ALEXANDER
(re his alien cap)
I still havent got this bloody thing off

GWEN
You could order something in

ALEXANDER
A boy comes to the door

GWEN
(a beat back to Jason)
I dont know It just wasnt like him
ALEXANDER

Yes poor Jason As we speak hes probably out somewhere talking
rubbish to a roomful of hangers-on While here I sit eating
Christmas cheese in Spring

16 INT JASONS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Jason sits on the edge of the bed staring at the TV sipping
scotch flipping channels He stops at the conclusion of an

42699 (PINK)

episode of GALAXY QUEST As Commander Taggart makes a heroic
speech Jason mouths the words along with his alterego

COMMANDER TAGGART (ON TV)

As long as there is injustice whenever a Targathian baby cries
out wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars Well
be there This fine ship and this fine crew Never give up
Never surrender

We pan back to the bed Jason has passed out body twisted face
down in a pillow

17 INT JASONS BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING

Jason sleeps hungover dead to the world His DOORBELL RINGS
He barely moves Every Indication is that hes dead More
ringing He stirs enough to groan and drags a pillow over his
head The ringing continues

18 EXT JASONS HOUSE

Jason opens the door in his robe drooping bloodshot eyes squint
of a headache There before him are THE ALIENS dressed in
their perfect GALAXY QUEST attire Jason stares at them bleary
eyed With earnest respectful faces the five salute him in the
classic GALAXY QUEST style Jason shuts the door in their face
DING DONG The door opens again

JASON
WHAT DO YOU WANT

The leader Mathesar steps forward Speaks quickly

MATHESAR

Sir I understand this is a terrible breach of protocol but
please I beg you to hear our plea We are Thermians from the
Klatu Nebula Our people are being systematically hunted and
slaughtered by Rothhar Sarris of Fatu-Krey Sarris wants the
Omega 13 We are to meet in negotiation However our past efforts
in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous The flames
the death

(he quickly gathers himself)

Please Captain you are our last hope

(a beat)
We have secured a limousine

JASON

Oh right The thing with the thing Come on in Ill get some
pants on

5499 (GOLDENROD)

19 INT JASONS HOUSE

The four aliens stand on one side of the room Jason mostly
dressed hunts under his couch for something

MATHESAR
Commander standing here in your presence is the greatest honor

we could ever have hoped to achieve in our lifetimes

Mostly all they can see of Jason at the moment is his butt

JASON
Thanks appreciate it Anybody seen my other shoe
20 INT LINCOLN LIMO

Jason sits in back with Mathesar and the others half-awake

NERU

Sir I am Neru senior requisition officer Before we travel to
the ship please let me know if you have any requirements
Weapons documents personnel

JASON
I could use a Coke

One of the aliens nods to the other who makes a note

TEB

Sir I am Teb I would like to explain the history between our
people and the Sarris Dominion in greater detail In the 5
million years following the great nebula burst our people were
one

JASON
What about him Doesnt he talk

TEB
His translator is broken

The fourth alien says something but it comes out a weird mix of
sounds Like a screaming baby inside a bagpipe

JASON

Okey doke So listen I had a late night with a Kreemorian
Fangor Beast so

(MORE)

42699 (PINK)
JASON (contd)
Im going to shut my eyes for a bit But go on Im listening to
every word

Jason is asleep before Teb gets the next sentence out
21 INT RECEIVING QUARTERS - PROTECTOR ITI

Jason is shaken softly by the shoulders He opens his eyes to see
a young female CREWMAN LALIARI We hear a low RUMBLE

LALIARI
I am sorry to wake you sir but your presence is requested on the
command deck

Jason tries to reorient himself as she leads him forward
22 INT HALLWAY - THE PROTECTOR II

Laliari escorts Jason down the high tech hallway Jason looks
around still holding his can of Coke

LALIARI

Sir Sarris has moved the deadline We are approaching his ship
at the Ni-delta now He wants an answer to his proposal I
understand you have been briefed

JASON
Yeah I got most of it in the car Hes the bad guy right

LALIARI

Yes sir he is a very bad man indeed He has tortured our
scientists put us to work in the gallium arsenide mines
captured our females for his own demented purposes

JASON
Okay Ive got the picture You have pages or do you want me to
just go for it

LALIARI
I m not sure lI

JASON (contd)

Script pages Never mind lets see what old Sarris has to say
for himself

Mathesar approaches with other CREWMEMBERS

42699 (PINK)

MATHESAR

Commander Welcome to the Protector II Would you like to don

your uniform

JASON
Mind If we skip that I have to get back pretty quick for this
thing in Van Nuys

MATHESAR
As you wish

Another ALIEN comes running up out of breath
EXCITED ALIEN Sir Its Sarris Hes here
23 INT COMMAND DECK

A door slides OPEN and Jason and the others enter the COMMAND
DECK Its straight out of the TV show Blinking lights

consoles the cool old tech displays But a bit dark Jason
looks around genuinely impressed still wearing his glasses

JASON
Not bad Usually its painted cardboard boxes in a garage

They lead him to the Commanders chair He sits

TEB

Sir we apologize for operating in low power mode but we are
experiencing a reflective flux field this close to the galactic
axis

JASON
No problem This thing have a cup holder

EXCITED ALIEN
(hands Jason a clipboard)
The situational analysis Commander

JASON
Whats your name

EXCITED ALIEN
(perplexed)
-Glath sir

Jason signs his autograph and hands it back There you go

NAVIGATOR
Were approaching in five ticks sir Command to slow

Jason looks toward the front windowview screen Stars move past
in a familiar display

JASON

Sure set the screen saver on two

(the NAVIGATOR looks confused)

Sorry Sorry Didnt mean to break he mood Slow to Mark 2
lieutenant

A SHIP appears on the screen growing closer It is a MENACING
craft sharp and jagged with a gargoyle shaped figurehead Then
the VIEWSCREEN fuzzes to life with an image of SARRIS - Hes
ugly and green hued Black sharp teeth A metal hand He
hisses There is a beat as the aliens take in the sight trying
to well their courage

SARRIS

I see fear That is expected

(his voice RESONATES)

Ah they bring a new Commander Such a cowardly species Not
even your own kind No matter Here are my demands and I
would suggest Commander that you think well before speaking a
word because these negotiations are tender and if I do not
like what I hear there will be blood and pain as you cannot
imagine

Jason takes a sip of coke and checks his watch

SARRIS
First I require the Omega 13 Second-

JASON

(blasé like a laundry list)

Okey dokey lets fire blue particle cannons full Fire red
particle cannons full Fire gannet magnets left and right Fire
pulse catapults from all chutes And throw this thing at him too
killer

He hands the GUNNER the empty coke can then before even waiting
for the weapons to reach their target he exits

24 HALLWAY

Jason emerges and looks both ways trying to get his bearings
Several of the aliens chase after him as he enters the

42699 (PINK)

corridor exchanging stunned dances trying to absorb the
magnitude of what just happened

MATHESAR

Commander Where are you going
JASON

Home

MATHESAR

You You mean Earth

JASON

Yeah Earth Time to get back to Earth kids

He turns a corner Jason is oblivious to the muffled sounds of
explosions traces of the demolition going on outside

MATHESAR
But Commander The negotiation You You You fired on
him
JASON
Right Long live Whats your planet

MATHESAR
Theramin

JASON
Long live Theramini Take a left here

MATHESAR
But what if Sarris survives

JASON
Oh I dont think so I gave him both barrels

MATHESAR
He has a very powerful ship Perhaps you would like to wait to
see the results of-

JASON

I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134s a parking lot
after 200 But listen the guy gives you any more trouble just
give a call

Mathesar produces a walkie talkie device for Jason

MATHESAR
An interstellar vox

42699 (PINK)

JASON
Thanks

Mathesar looks him in the eye A TEAR starts down his cheek He
HUGS Jason then shakes his hand sincerely

MATHESAR
How can we thank you Commander You- You have saved our people

JASON
It was a lot of fun You kids are great

The others shake his hand thanking him as they enter the
25 INTERSTELLAR POD ROOM

A room with a very high circular ceiling The aliens continue
thanking Jason as they lead him to the center of the room Jason
realizes hes left all alone in this strange room with no visible
doors Jason is suddenly aware that he is standing on a GLOWING
RED DISK

JASON
Wait Wheres the car
Suddenly a CLEAR CYLINDER rises from the disk and conforms around
him ENCASING HIM IN A CLEAR BULLET SHAPED CONTAINER There is
only an instant to register surprise as the ceiling divides and
an AWE INDUCING ROTATING STARFIELD is revealed The WALLS pull
back around him And Jason finds himself surrounded by THE
INFINITE VASTNESS OF SPACE And his face is a MASK OF HORROR In
the split instant as Jason in his pod is ROCKETED FORWARD INTO
SPACE

26 BLACK - JASONS YARD

We pull back slowly from the iris of Jasons eye He is now
standing on the red disk in the middle of his own back yard He
stands there in shock TEETH CHATTERING SHIVERING IN WAVES AND
WAVES from the incomprehension of what hes just experienced
unable to move from the snot

27 NT BRANDONS GARAGE - TARZANA - DUSK

Crickets chirp Inside the open garage of a suburban house sits
BRANDON and his friends in their uniforms surrounded by a
homemade space ship interior constructed of painted cardboard
boxes and Christmas lights Brandon and his friends look very
disappointed The Commander never showed

28 EXT COMPUTER STORE PARKING LIT - MORNING

28A COMPUTER STORE - LATER

The actors hand out pamphlets and sign the occasional autograph
Fred pats Alexanders back who stares ahead morose Around the
corner JASON appears looking around with a disoriented yet
exhilarated twinkle in his eye He spots his friends and starts
quickly toward the cast table but runs smack into the group of
FANS led by Brandon Brandon and Jason go down along with an
armful of GALAXY QUEST collectables
BRANDON
Commander My apologies

Brandon is nudged by his friend KYLE
BRANDON
Commander Evidently we had miscommunication regarding

yesterdays scheduled voyage and-

But Jason still in a haze simply gathers his things and walks
off The other nerds look at Brandon

KYLE
He dissed us AGAIN Brandon

BRANDON

(hiding his disappointment)

He probably Has some very important business to attend to
HOLLISTER

(just letting off steam)
Maybe we should just start a Star Trek club

The others turn silent incredulous Brandon looks at Hollister
with hard cold eyes Pacinos scene with Fredo

BRANDON
Dont EVER say that to me again

He walks away The others stare at Hollister
28B ACTORS TABLE
The actors look up to see JASON approaching

ALEXANDER
Do you know what time it is Why did you even bother to show up

Jason has so much to say he cant get out a word Gwen notices
his wrinkled slept-in clothing and wild eyes

GWEN
Jason Are you all right

Jason POINTS to the sky grasping for words

JASON

I was there (a beat) Up There

(intense)

They came to the convention I thought they were fans but
theyre not They took me up to their ship Theyre called
Thermians or Thatians I dont know I was a little hungover
(actors exchange glances)

What they built Its incredible I fought this man this
THING called Sarris I kicked his ASS They have these
pods One took me THROUGH a black hole

(crazy smile The others stare)
I know I know what youre thinking But I can prove it Look
They gave me this

5499 (GOLDENROD)

He searches his pockets frantically and produces the interstellar
vox The thing blinks its little red light He motions
victoriously The others exchange glances then produce their own
blinking voxes and set them on the table

JASON
Yes but can you talk to people in SPACE on yours (into Vox)
Protector this is the Commander Come in protector

The others exchange glances Alexander turns to Gwen

ALEXANDER
God what an ass

JASON
COME IN PROTECTOR PROTECTOR

Tommy rolls up his sleeve ready for a fight

TOMMY
Thats it Its go time

GWEN
Dont do it Tommy Hes not worth it

Jason notices a label on his vox that reads Property of Brandon
Wheeger He looks around for Brandon

JASON
This isnt mine Wait where is that kid

GWEN
You know its one thing to treat us this way but how can you do
this to your fans

Jason looks up and sees the young woman we recognize as Thermian
LALIARI Shes flanked by two young crewmen

LALIARI
Begging your pardon Commander we come with news Sarris lives
He was able upon your departure to make an escape However he has
contacted us and wishes to surrender We humbly implore you to
return with us to negotiate the terms

Jason looks at Laliari then turns back to the others his
experience twinkling in his eyes

5499 (GOLDENROD)
JASON

They want me back I I want you all to come You have to
come with me Itll be the most amazing experience of your lives
Welre going to negotiate an alien generals SURRENDER in SPACE
You have to- Guys GUYS

They have begun to walk away one by one in disgust Only Gwen
remains She looks at Jason

JASON
Gwen you know me Im a lot of things but Im not crazy

But Gwen shakes her head and walks off
28C INT ELECTRONICS STORE SHIPPING WAREHOUSE NEAR DOCK

Jason inspects himself In a mirror He meticulously smoothes his
Commanders Insignia fastens a stray buckle carefully picks a
piece of lint off his shirt Then he looks Into his own eyes for
a long moment finally turning to Laliari a smile eyes
GLISTENING Nearby a POD DISK on the floor GLOWS

JASON

The actors enter their dressing room

TOMMY

The actors hurry through the aisles to the back of the store
Gwen shouts to an EMPLOYEE stocking shelves

GWEN

The Employee points to the back taken with Gwens beauty
29 INT LECTRONICS STORE WAREHOUSE NEAR DOCK

Gwen Alex and the others enter and look around Laliari is
still in the room alone She lights up as they enter

GWEN
Were coming too
LALIARI

Wonderful The Commander had me continue transmitting in the
hopes you would change your mind (to Vox) Protector requesting
six Interstellar pods for immediate departure

Tommy rolls his eyes at Gwen These fans But Gwen suddenly
notices the POD DISKS glowing beneath their feet

GWEN
Guys Guys

Alex tries to step off the disk but It MOVES TO FOLLOW HIM

ALEXANDER
What in the world

LALIARI
I look forward to meeting you all in person when we arrive at the
ship End transmission

And with that Laliari blinks and VANISHES She was simply a
HOLOGRAM TRANSMISSION Full realization hits Gwen

GWEN
Oh my God OH MY GOD

30 INT NSEA PROTECTOR DOCKING STATION POD BAY- DEEP SPACE

The room LIGHTS BRILLIANTLY with a series of flashes In rapid
succession the PODS arrive with a flash through a hatch In the
ceiling They unfold to reveal Gwen Alexander Tommy and Guy who
stand paralyzed and teeth chattering They look like a bunch of
horrified bowling pins all facing toward

A METAL HATCH - Beyond It they register the SOUND of WET
FOOTSTEPS growing closer Their eyes widen as they see the
hatch open revealing a group of 5 HORRIBLE TENTACLED DROOLING
SCREGING ALIEN MONSTERS who surround our visitors probing them
with jagged devices Then one of the monsters looks down at a
mechanism on his belt

MONSTER 1
Oops Crewmen your skins Activate your E-skins

42999 (GREEN)

The monsters all flip switches on their belts their forms become
HUMAN uniformed as ships TECHNICIANS

TECHNICIAN 1
Our most sincere apologies We forgot about our appearance
generators

Then JASON appears in the doorway wearing a big warm smile

JASON
Guys You CAME
They stand there still paralyzed and terrified

JASON
Okay who wants the grand tour

Guy is now relaxed enough to let out the loudest most genuine
SCREAM youve ever heard in your life A beat

JASON
Okay Guy Anybody else

Then another streak of light and Fred appears along side the
others He steps off of the disk unaffected

FRED

Now that was a hell of a thing
(to Jason motioning to others)
Whats wrong with them

Jason smiles Nothing gets to Fred
31 INT PROTECTOR DOCKING STRUCTURE - HALLWAY

Jason leads Gwen Alexander Tommy Guy and Fred down the hall
They shuffle forward like recent hospital releases looking
around silent and dumbfounded at their surroundings occasional
involuntary JERKS of their limbs evidence of their horrifying
journey

JASON

Thats right Just keep shaking it out Here have some gum
It helps

TOMMY

Wh Where are we

JASON
Twenty third quadrant of gamma sector I can show you on a map

Then Mathesar appears coming down the hall with a small group of
ALIENS He has a warm smile on his face

MATHESAR
Welcome my friends I am Mathesar On behalf of my people I wish

to thank you from the deepest place in our hearts

He reaches out to shake their hands respectfully

MATHESAR
Dr Lazarus Lt Madison Young Laredo how youve grown Tech
Sgt Chen And

He looks at Guy quizzically not sure who he is
GUY
Crewman 6 Call me Guy

GWEN
You know us

MATHESAR

(soft laugh)

I dont believe there is a man woman or child on my planet who
does not In the years since we first received your ships
historical documents we have studied every facet of your
missions technologies and strategies

ALEXANDER
Historical documents

MATHESAR

Yes Eighteen years ago we received transmission of the first

It continued for four years and then stopped as mysteriously as
it came

TOMMY

Youve been watching the sho
(hes nudged by Jason)

the historical records out HERE

MATHE EAR

Yes in the last hundred years our society had fallen into
disarray Our goals our values had become scattered But since
the transmission we have modeled many aspects of our society from
your example and it has saved us Your courage teamwork
friendship through the adversity

They all exchange glances

MATHESAR (contd)
In fact all you see around you comes from the lessons garnered
from the historical documents

GWEN
THATS why you built this ship

GUY
Its incredible

JASON

Oh this No this isnt the ship This is only the star port for
the ship

(a twinkle In his eye)

You want to see the ship

He pushes a button and a door opens leading to a DOCKING POD

32 INT DOCKING POD

They enter He pushes another button and the doors close and
the transport starts moving As it clears a wall we see out the
window A MAGNIFICENT AND BREATHTAKING VIEW OF THE ENORMOUS NSEA
PROTECTOR DOCKED IN FRONT OF TH They all gawk at the amazing
sight their eyes wide like children

ALEXANDER
Oh my god Its real

GWEN
All this from watching the historical records

MATHESAR
Yes and from your supplementary technical documents of
course

He motions to another alien who withdraws a number of brightly
colored BOOKS and BOXES from a backpack The actors look through
the various FAN BOOKS and ENTERTAINMENT SOFTWARE bearing such
titles as THE OFFICIAL GALAXY QUEST BLUEPRINTS NSEA PROTECTOR
and VIRTUAL GAAAXY QUEST THE CDROM EXPERIENCE The actors

exchange glances and then Tommy begins to giggle Alex looks
at him at the fan stuff then out at the ENORMOUS SHIP and he
begins to laugh too The others join in laughing like maniacs

hysterical disbelieving laughter as they head toward the GIANT
SHIP

33 INT PROTECTOR - CORRIDOR

The group walks down the corridor peeking into various rooms
more awestruck every second As they pass each room the CREW
MEMBERS inside salute FEMALE crew members pass occasionally
saluting and offering Hello Commanders to Jason This does not
escape Gwens notice

(Guy always seems to be just outside the group a little late
always trying to see between their heads)

MATHESAR
The medical quarters are to the left

The actors WHISPER to Jason all at once

TOMMY
What the hell is going on

34 GENERATOR ROOM

The group enters The centerpiece of the room is a large
pulsating ORB When the orb dims we see its surface has a rocky

texture like a large boulder Many TECHS scurry about tending to
the surrounding measurement devices
MATHESAR
The generator room Our Beryllium Sphere of course I hope
Tech Sergeant Chen that this meets with your approval

Fred runs his finger along a gleaming copper tube with authority

FRED
Fine Real clean

Three YOUNGER CREWMEN approach and whisper to Mathesar They
argue a bit then Mathesar reticently approaches Fred

5499 (GOLDENROD)

MATHESAR

Tech Sgt Chen I am sorry to ask this of you so shortly after
your arrival But members of our reactor staff have a question
they find most pressing

FRED
Uh huh

LAHNK

Sir we have had unexplained proton surges in our delta unit
They cannot be verified on the sub frequency spectrum but appear
on the valence detector when scanning the Beryllium Sphere We
are unable to resolve this problem and were hoping you would be

a

ble to advise us
Everyone turns to Fred Silence

FRED
Uh huh I see Well thats a puzzler isnt it

The others exchange glances wondering what hell say Then Fred
turns to one of the Techs

FRED
U What do you think

NERVOUS TECH
That possibly The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally

FRED
What does that mean

NERVOUS TECH

What does that mean Yes I see Yes It means that
perhaps the bonding molecules have become covalent
FRED

Covalent Right So

NERVOUS TECH

So our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate - A two
molecule compound sharing a free electron - and bombard the ions
with their reflective isotopes
42999 (GREEN)

FRED
OK

The other TECHS grin astonished

LANK
Of course Its so obvious

TECH 2
Sergeant Chen youre a genius

Fred waves off the praise modestly Mathesar shoots a look to
Lahnk as if to say were in good hands here

MATHESAR

Now I suggest that you rest before we take the ship out of dock
These crewmen will escort you to your quarters

QUELLEK

completely barren

ALEXANDER
Wheres my bed

5499 (GOLDENROD)
Quellek pushes a button and SIX LARGE SPIKES rise from the floor

QUELLEK

Just as on your home planet sir If I may say it took me three
years to master the spikes but now I sleep with a peace I never
thought possible

ALEXANDER
Is that the bathroom

QUELLEK

Yes sir The use of your waste facilities were strangely absent
from the historical records so we had to extrapolate purely on
the basis of your anatomy

37 INT ALEXS BATHROOM
They enter Alex looks down at a thing that looks more like a

torture device than a toilet with elaborate tubes and stirrups
and plugs going everywhere

She finishes and turns

They just look at each other for a moment Gwen breaks out into a
smile trying to find the words

JASON (contd)
Yeah I know

GWEN

I just cant believe it Any of it Look at this room They
designed it based on the Tuaran Pleasure ship from historical
document thirty seven

(looks at a mirror)

Oh and wait wait listen to this

(looks up)

Yes

GWEN
Whats the weather like outside

COMPUTER
There is no weather in space

GWEN
I never get tired of that joke

JASON
Let me try Computer (no response) Computer
GWEN
Only answers to me

JASON
But Im the Commander

GWEN

On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says So

thats what they built

JASON
Cmon were wanted up on the command deck

But Gwen holds her ground

GWEN
Wait When are you going to tell them

42099 (BLUE)

JASON
Tell them About

GWEN

Who we are Dont you think theyre going to be PISSED

JASON
Are you kidding Im not going to tell them

42099 (BLUE)

GWEN

Well you have to tell them What if something happens Were
actors not astronauts We cant do this stuff

JASON

Its not the STUFF I mean anybody can learn the STUFF The
important thing is COMMITMNT 99 of anything is just committing
to it

GWEN

Ninty-nine percent of ACTING is commitment ACTING

never manned a resonance cannon she taught ACTING

Gwen moves toward the door

JASON
Hey Hey where are you going

GWEN
We have no right to do this They deserve to know

JASON
Gwen Gwen cmon wait no

Just then the door opens Laliari enters

Stella Adler
LALIARI

Lt Madison The females of the ship have requested your imprint
for archival purposes at the proposed Tawny Madison Institute for
Computer Research

Gwen looks at Laliari her eyes softening as she imprints her
hand in a glowing PAD

41 INT COMMAND DECK

They enter and gawk at the familiar hub waiting for the show to
start not realizing they ARE the show

MATHESAR
If you would all take your positions

THE ACTORS
Oh right US Yes of course US

They take their positions marveling at the familiar control
panels in front of them Tommy turns to Guy

TOMMY
Look This thingy I remember I had it all worked out This
was forward back

MATHESAR
Commander some of the crew has requested to be present at this
historic event
Mathesar motions and a few CREWMEN enter followed by a dozen
more followed by FIFTY more They stand around the periphery
of the room watching eagerly Tommy turns to Guy

TOMMY
No pressure huh Glad Im not the Commander

COMMANDER
Okay Lareo take her out

Everyone in the room turns their attention to Tommy His
sarcastic smile drops He looks mortified

TOMMY
Excuse me

JASON
They designed the ship from watching you So Take her out
Lieutenant

Tommy stares down at his control panel Its pretty self
explanatory a throttle and a circular dial for direction But
daunting nonetheless

TOMMY
Right Okay yeah sure

Everyones eyes are glued to him as he moves the throttle forward
slightly The ENGINES COME TO LIFE a massive exhilarating sound
Tommy giggles nervously His hand trembles as he pushes the
throttle further The ship start to move The actors exchange
worried glances

TOMMY
Oh god Oh my god

42 EXT SHIP

You can feel the WEIGHT of the giant craft as it eases forward
sliiding through the sides of the dock

Everyone watches the forward monitor Tommy turns the NAVIGATION
DIAL slowly Guy whispers to him

GUY
More to the left Stay parallel

TOMMY
Hey YOU want to drive

44 EXT STAR DOCK
Indeed the ship is slightly off course Its like trying to

get out of a tight parking space with concrete walls to either
side And the ship is veering ever so slightly into one of the
walls
42999 (GREEN)
45 INT COMMAND DECK

Tommy turns the dial to correct But it looks like the momentum
might carry the ship into the wall anyway Tommy PEGS the dial
to the left The others hold their breath as the bow of the
ship moves closer and closer to the wall Then It TOUCHES
The sound of a soft but high pitched SCRAAAAAAAPE

TOMMY
Oh shit

46 EXT STAR DOCK
The ship is stopped just grazing the wall EVER SO SLIGHTLY
47 INT COMMAND DECK

All eyes are on Tommy He doesnt know what to do Should he
continue forward or back up and scrape again for sure The
classic parking lot dilemma magnified by ten thousand Tommy
grasps the throttle and moves it slightly forward SCRAAAAAAPE
He keeps going in too deep to back out now And the ship
continues to SCRAAAAAPE for a couple of horrible seconds as it
completes the curve And then it is free The beautiful craft
glides slowly out to open space Jason and the others let out a
sigh of relief

JASON
Very good Lieutenant Forward Mark two

Tommy smiles relieved He pushes throttle to the 2

TOMMY
Mark two Commander

48 EXT SHIP

The ship glides out to space only a relatively minor scrape of
the paint job to show for the incident

49 INT DINING HALL

extravagant meal Mathesar makes a toast

Wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars well be
there this fine

Everyone clinks glasses Quellek tips his glass to Alexander as
Teb turns to Tommy

We are sorry about the instrumentation Lt Laredo There must
have been a malfunction in the steerage mechanism

TOMMY

Just see that it doesnt happen again

TEB

Yes sir

How are you enjoying your food Lt Madison

GWEN
Oh its fantastic French is my favorite

TEB

Yes we programed the food synthesizer for each of you based on
the regional menu of your birthplace

Are you enjoying your Kep-mok bloodticks Dr Lazarus

Alexander miserable toys with a bowl of living insects swimming
in a disgustingly vomit-textured broth

ALEXANDER
Tell me Mathesar this Sarris bloke were flying to meet What
is it he wants exactly
MATHESAR

For years Sarris has plundered the resources of our planet Our
people our technologies We built this ship in order to finda
new planet to settle One far away from Sarris We are not a
people accustomed to confrontation We are scientists This ship
was our salvation

A tick jumps off of Alexanders spoon back into the soup

But Sarris found out about our plans just as we had completed
construction of the

MATHESAR (contd)

Protector II He heard about the device The Omega 13
GUY

The Omega 13 Why does that sound so familiar

GWEN

The lost footage At the convention The mysterious device in our
last episo--historical document

TOMMY
What is it What does it do

MATHESAR
We dont know

GWEN

But You built one right

TEB

We built something from the blueprints and what references
we could find on your internet Our computer neural nets made

educated guesses in areas we were uncertain So there is
actually much about the device we dont even understand We were
hoping you could enlighten us

JASON

Well its This was a device we

(looks around for help)

discovered on an alien planet We dont know what it does
either

TOMMY
Why dont you just turn it on and see

TEB

It has at its heart a reactor capable of generating unthinkable
energy If we were mistaken in our construction by even the
slightest calculation the device would act as a molecular
explosive causing a chain reaction that would obliterate all
matter in the universe

ALEXANDER
Let me at the switch

42699 (PINK)

JASON
Mathesar Has Sarris seen the historical records

MATHESAR
NO Thank God he has not

JASON
Then how did he find out about the device

MATHESAR
Our former Commander was not Strong

JASON
Former Commander

MATHESAR
Im sorry You deserve to be shown

He nods to a Crewman who pushes a button A wall panel moves
aside to reveal a large VIEWSCREEN An image appears with a lot
of static and the sound cuts in and out

MATHESAR
The tape was partially demagnetized as it was smuggled off of
Sarris ship

But through the static we can make out an image The former
Commander in ALIEN form Is strapped to a metal board Each of
his wrists and ankles is secured with mechanical devices and
twisted in different directions

MATHESAR
Originally one of our own tried to lead

ONSCREEN Sarris stands over the alien with a control panel

SARRIS (ON MONITOR)
Is that all You have no more to confess to me No After three
days of this you still require incentive

Sarris moves switches on the panel The device pulls at the
aliens limbs twisting them horribly Bones crackle

ALIEN COMMANDER (ON MONITOR)

I say again I have told you all I know To my shame I have
told you everything If you have any mercy within you please
let me die

42899 (YELLOW)
SARRIS
Oh I shall I shall When I grow weary of the noises you make
my little plaything be assured you shall die

Sarris toys with his control panel Mercifully the screen fuzzes
up with static and we can only HEAR the bone chilling SCREAMS

We PAN around the table past GWEN ALEXANDER TOMMY GUYTheir
mouths open in horror as they watch the screen Camera stops on

GWEN
Your crew What about you

Jason looks torn He starts to say something but-

The actors enter the empty deck followed by Mathesar

GWEN
Theres nobody here Jason

JASON
Mathesar maybe we should get some of your crew up here

MATHESAR

I thank you for your consideration to our pride but while my
people are talented scientists our attempts to operate our own
technologies under tactical simulation have been disastrous

He leans over to Gwens computer station as she sits and pushes
a button

MATHESAR
I have raised Sarris on zeta frequency

GWEN
Uh Great Thanks

JASON
Still Mathesar your crew may nonetheless be helpful in certain-

But he is interrupted by the sight of SARRIS appearing on the
large VIEWSCREEN Sarris now wears a metal eyepatch and has a
long scar across his cheek

SARRIS
We meet again Commander

The crew stares at Sarris A frightening visage

JASON
Yes Hi Sarris How are you doing

SARRIS
Better than my Lieutenant He failed to activate ships neutron
armor as quickly as Id hoped on our last encounter

He brings into view a stake with the impaled head of his former
Lieutenant

JASON

Right Well Listen Im (laughs) Im sorry about that
whole thing before It was kind of a misunderstanding Im
sure we can work this out like reasonable people Hows the
uh

(motions to his eyepatch)
that going to heal up God I hope so I feel just awful
about that
SARRIS
Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship

JASON
Listen Id like to but frankly Im not even sure where it is
or even

SARRIS
You have ten seconds

JASON
All right You got it You win Ill deliver it now Just give
me a moment to set it up

Jason motions to Gwen to cut the transmission Gwen nods
JASON
All right now nobody panic Ive dealt with this guy before and

believe me hes as stupid as he is ugly

GWEN

JASON
Were going to fire everything weve got at him all right

Guy looks at the buttons labeled with icons of armaments

GUY
Okay

JASON
All right Put me back on with him

GWEN
Im trying to tell you You ARE on with him

SARRIS
Perhaps I am not as stupid as I am ugly Commander

Jason turns to Gwen horrified

JASON
I made the CUT THE LINE gesture You nodded okay

GWEN
I thought It was the Were dead gesture I was agreeing Like I
know where the hold button is

Tommy looks at the sparkling map of lights on his dash

TOMMY

JASON
Just GO GO DAMMIT PUNCH GO

Tommy punches the red button They all hold on for dear life as
the ship roars forward across the path of Sarris ship

GWEN
Theyre turning Theyre COMING

An explosion rocks the ship Then another and ANOTHER

COMPUTER
The ship is sustaining structural damage
GWEN
Guys were sustaining structural damage

JASON
Faster Tommy Get us out of here

TOMMY

GUY
Theyre still behind us

JASON
We should have a turbo Im always saying activate turbo

TOMMY

JASON

He pushes the turbo The ship begins to VIBRATE

COMPUTER
The enemy is matching velocity

GWEN
The enemy is matching velocity

ALEXANDER
We heard it the first time

GWEN
Shit Im doing it Im repeating the damn computer

Suddenly an image of Fred down in the generator room appears on
the side viewscreen Hes taking it all in stride

FRED

Hi guys Listen theyre telling me that the generators wont
take it the ships breaking apart and all that Just FYI
The viewscreen goes black The ship ROARS forward

ALEXANDER
Weve got to stop

JASON
We stop we die Keep holding the thruster down Tommy

ALEXANDER
You dont hold a thruster down Its for quick boosts

JASON
Like YOU know
The ship GROANS and CREAKS Then a loud KLAXON sounds

GWEN
I remember that sound Thats a bad sound

Jason looks forward In the distance is an amorphous MASS

JASON
Maybe we can lose them in that cloud

5499 (GOLDENROD)

GWEN
I dont think thats a cloud

As they approach the cloud reveals itself to actually be
thousands upon thousands of SLOWLY ROTATING OCTAHEDRONS

JASON
Mathesar What is that

MATHESAR

Its the Tothian mine field left standing from the Great War of

Their jaws drop as they see the vast array of MINES

ALEXANDER
May I get the check

GWEN
The ships are gaining

JASON
Do your best Tommy

TOMMY

Oh god

THE FIRST MINE HITS ROCKING THE SHIP BOOM Tommy SWERVES to
avoid it running into another mine Then another Tommy

couldnt do worse if he were aiming for them

ALEXANDER
Could you possibly try (BOOM) not to hit (BOOM) every (BOOM)
single (BOOM) one

TOMMY
Theyre drifting toward me I think theyre magnetic

vibrating stops Gwen looks up from her radar screen

ALEXANDER

TOMMY
The engines are dead Were drifting

JASON
Are they behind us

GWEN
No I dont think so Wait Theyre not but Something is
(beat) Oh my god

They look out the rear view screen to see TWO DOZEN MAGNETIC
MINES BEARING DOWN ON THEM IN A CLUSTER

JASON
DOWN

They barely have time to brace themselves as the ship is ROCKED
by WAVES of explosions They hit the floor and try to ride it
out Its brutal

5499 (GOLDENROD)
EXT SHIP

The last of the mines explodes and the ship is sent tumbling
lifelessly end over end through space The exterior lights are
dark The once shiny hull now blackened and ragged

55 INT COMMAND DECK

The deck looks dead and empty Smoke is in the air The lights
are dim The sirens have stopped Its completely silent The
crew slowly emerges from behind panels and equipment bruised and
bloodied Jason moves to Gwen

JASON

Are you all right
(she nods rising)
Tommy Wheres Tommy

They hear a GROAN Tommy is crumpled against the wall his arm
twisted impossibly Hes in agony

TOMMY
Its broke Oh God Oh God

MATHESAR

They exit limping Alexander rises moves past Jason Blood
trickles down his forehead In a mocking tone

ALEXANDER

The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress

GWEN
Its fractured

JASON
Can it be repaired

GWEN
Computer can it be repaired

COMPUTER
Negative The Beryllium sphere will have to be replaced

GWEN
We need another one

GUY
Shit the Beryllium sphere Thats bad

ALEXANDER

(to Jason)

You broke the ship You broke the bloody SHIP I told you you
dont hold down a turbo You push it once maybe twice for a
boost but you dont HOLD it

JASON
Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard

GWEN
Computer do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard

COMPUTER
Negative no reserve Beryllium sphere exists onboard

GWEN
No we dont have an extra Beryllium sphere

42699 (PINK)

TOMMY
You know thats really getting annoying
GWEN

(deadly)

I have ONE job on this lousy ship Its stupid but Im going to
DO it GOT IT

TOMMY
(intimidated)
Sure no problem

Suddenly the door opens and seven Aliens enter led by Mathesar
They look VERY SERIOUS Guy exchanges an uh oh glance with
Tommy But the aliens fall to one knee lowering their heads

MATHESAR
A thousand apologies We have failed you

JASON
You what What are you talking about

MATHESAR

(wracked with sadness)

We have seen you victorious in many more desperate situations
The fault must lie with us with the ship

Gwen shoots Jason a glance TELL THEM
JASON
No Listen Mathesar its not your fault Were Were

He cant bring himself to finish

GWEN
Were not the people you think we are

MATHESAR
I dont understand

ALEXANDER
Mathesar dont you have television on your planet Theater
Films

MATHESAR

The historical documents of your culture Yes in fact we have
begun to

42899 (YELLOW)

MATHESAR (contd)

GWEN
No not historical documents Theyre not all historical
documents I mean surely you dont think Gilligans Island

is a
Mathesar and the others exchange sad glances

MATHESAR
Those poor people

TOMMY
Hoo boy

Mathesar and the others exchange quizzical looks

GWEN
Does no one on your planet behave in a way that is contrary to
reality

MATHESAR
Ah You speak of

Unable to bring the words to mind he confers with his fellows

MATHESAR
Deception Lies

JASON
Well Sort of

MATHESAR

We have become aware of these concepts only recently In our
dealings with Sarris Often Sarris will say one thing and do
another Promise us mercy and deliver destruction It isa
concept we are beginning to learn at some great cost

(a worried beat)

But if you are saying that any of you could have traits in common
with Sarris

5499 (GOLDENROD)
He starts to laugh and the other aliens join in

MATHESAR
You are our protectors Our heroes You will save us

Suddenly a VIEWSCREEN lights and we see Fred on the monitor from
down in the generator room

FRED (ON SCREEN)

Hey Commander Listen we found some Beryllium on a nearby
planet We might be able to get there if we re-configure the
solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion What do you
think

JASON
IWell uh Yes absolutely

Fred turns to two young TECHS next to him then licks and sticks
two sticky GOLD STARS onto their wrists They beam

FRED
Correct Gold star for you and a gold star for you
57 EXT SHIP

The ship lumbers slowly forward In the distance we see the
swirling globe of a colorful and mysterious PLANET

58 INT SURFACE POD BAY - LATER

Jason Gwen Tommy Fred and Guy enter the small surface pod
Quellek Alexanders protege steps forward hands Alex a device

QUELLEK
Dr Lazarus here is your surface mapper I have programed it to
the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density

ALEXANDER
Thanks

QUELLEK

(emotional)

Good luck on your mission Sir By Grabthars Hammer by the Suns
of Warvan I wish you-

ALEXANDER
(holds up a warning finger)
Uh uh What did we talk about

QUELLEK
Right Sorry sir
59 INT SURFACE POD

Tommy pilots the craft as the pod approaches the beautiful and
mysterious planet Guy looks out the window nervously

GUY
I changed my mind I want to go back

ALEXANDER
After the big fuss you made about not getting left behind on the
ship

GUY

Yeah but thats when I thought maybe was the crewman that stays
on the shin and something is up there and it kills me but now
Im thinking Im the guy who gets killed by some monster five
minutes after we land on the planet

JASON
Guy youre not going to get killed on the planet okay

GUY
Oh Im not Im not Then whats my last name

JASON
Your last name
5499 (GOLDENROD

GUY
Yeah what is it

JASON
Its I dont know

GUY

No Nobody does Do you know WHY Because my character Isnt
IMPORTANT enough for a last name Because Im going to DIE five
minutes in why bother to come up with a last name for me

GWEN
Guy you HAVE a last name We just dont KNOW it

GUY

Do I DO I For all you know Im just CREWMAN 6

(hysterical) Okay its FLEEGMAN Guy FLEEGMAN There Now Ima

Jason slaps him

GUY

See Im the hysterical guy who needs to be slapped and then I
die

ALEXANDER

(sighs)

Are we there yet

60 EXT SURFACE POD

The pod makes its way toward the surface

61 INT POD

The ship shakes as it lands Everyone exchanges anxious glances
As they set down everyone applauds complimenting Tommy on the

landing Tommy looks away shamed

TOMMY
Autopilot

Everyone looks away disappointed Suddenly the HATCH opens with
a loud PHHHHT of air decompression Fred has opened it

GUY
What are you doing You dont just open the door Its an alien
planet Is there air You dont know do you

3499 (GOLDENROD)

Fred sniffs the air
FRED
Seems okay

Guy sighs
62 EXT PLANET SURFACE - DAY

The six exit the craft tentatively Guy looks around
apprehensive

JASON
Which way Alex

Alexander looks down at his mapper

ALEXANDER
This way Wait no that way

They turn in the opposite direction

TOMMY
You were holding it upside down werent you

ALEXANDER
Shut up

TOMMY
You know with the makeup and everythingl I actually thought he
was smart for a second

ALEXANDER
You think you could do better Laredo

TOMMY
Hey watch that Laredo shit

GUY
Were screwed Were so screwed

JASON
All right lets all settle down If were going to get through
this were going to have to exercise self control

GWEN

Self control Thats funny coming from the guy that slept with
every Moon Princess and Terrakian slave girl on the show
5499 (GOLDENROD)

JASON

Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more

supportive you could have held on to me

GWEN
I could have held on to YOU

ALEXANDER
We re really going to do this HERE
63 OMIT
64 ROCKY INCLINE - SPOOKYVILLE

Its darker here more menacing Jagged cliff overhangs form
spooky shapes Guy looks around nervously

JASON
How much further

Alexander measures the distance on the device between his fingers
and holds them up

ALEXANDER
About this much

JASON
Whats the scale Is that ten miles A hundred miles

ALEXANDER
THIS much

Guy glances back to see the rocky trench they just passed
through The ROCK SHAPES jutting from the walls look vaguely like
arms and hands

Suddenly Guy YELLS as he drops out of frame The others turn to
see him on the ground struggling his foot lodged in a crevice

in the landscape

GUY
Its got me its got me See FIVE MINUTES I told you

Jason runs back and starts to help extricate Guy He pulls his
foot free and looks around

GUY
Something grabbed me IT DID

5499 (GOLDENROD)

The others shake their heads and continue forward Guy rises
trying to put his shoe back on as he runs to catch up

JASON
Easy son Its just your imagination Hang tough

He clasps Guys shoulder in a commanderly way

GWEN
Youre playing your good side

JASON
Dont be ridiculous
ALEXANDER
And note the sucked in gut

TOMMY
Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps

FRED
Its the rugged pose

The all nod in agreement Jason is about to object when suddenly
everyone is stopped in their tracks by SPOOKY ALIEN WHISPERING
and the sound of CRITTERS climbing around the surrounding cliffs

GUY
Thats it thats whats going to kill me

JASON
Lets just pick up the pace a little shall we

65 CREST OF HILL

They climb to the crest out of breath Guy arrives last They
clear the ridge and Look down onto

66 VALLEY BELOW - MINING OUTPOST

Below there is a small ABANDONED MINING FACILITY Wind WHISTLES
through various structures and power stations In the center of
the outpost sits a large shimmering boulder

JASON
There it is The Beryllium sphere

5499 (GOLDENROD)

ALEXANDER
Must be some sort of mining facility

GWEN
Where are the miners

GUY
Something BAD happened here

TOMMY
Will you relax

Suddenly they become aware of a SMALL BLUE CREATURE emerging from
one of the structures Its blue and looks somewhat like a human
child It moves to a small pool of water and begins drinking
Its movements are very quiet and tentative Then a few more BLUE
CHILDREN emerge and join the first

GWEN

(smiling amazed)

Look at that Will you LOOK at that They look like little
children
ALEXANDER
Could they be the miners

FRED
Sure Theyre like three years old

ALEXANDER
MINERS not MINORS

He pronounces the two words exactly the same Fred looks at Alex
like hes crazy

FRED
You Okay Alex

GUY
I dont like this I dont like this at all

GWEN
Oh theyre so cute

GUY

Of course theyre cute NOW But in a second theyre going to turn
MEAN and UGLY somehow and then there are going to be a million
MORE of them

5499 (GOLDENROD)

Then another blue creature emerges This one limps its leg is
hurt It moves forward DRAGGING its bad foot along the ground
making NOISE

EVERYONE
Awwww Its hurt

Gwen rises up a little tentatively waving at Limpy

GWEN
Hi Hi there little guy

Guy PUSHES her down behind the rock before the creatures notice

GUY
Jesus didnt ANY of you watch the show

The BLUE CHILDREN turn toward Limpy and begin whispering in an
alien tongue

ALIEN CHILDREN
Gorignak Gorignak Nak nak

GWEN
Aw look Theyre helping the hurt one

Indeed the others move to the hurt creature cocking their heads
to the side empathetically
Then suddenly we see the aliens SMILE with SHARP RAZOR TEETH
their mouths SPREADING OUT IMPOSSIBLY ON THEIR FACES They
DESCEND on LIMPY ripping him apart We only see a GEYSER OF
BLOOD from the center of the blue circle Our group is
silent horrified

GUY
I am SO SICK of being right

GWEN
(stunned horror)
Lets get out of here before one of those things kills guy

JASON
We gotta get that sphere or we arent going anywhere

Reluctantly they all nod in agreement
5499 (GOLDENROD)

JASON

All right heres the plan First Fred we need a diversion

to clear those things out of the compound then Gwen Alex Fred
and I go down to get the sphere Any of those things come back
give a signal Guy you set up a perimeter

GWEN
Why does this sound so familiar

TOMMY
Assault on Voltareck III Episode 31 I think

GUY
Were doing episode 31

TOMMY
Whatever the one with the hologram The wall of fire

GWEN
How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram

GUY
Were doing episode 31 Jason

JASON
It doesnt have to be a hologram Just a diversion

GUY
Jason are we doing Episode 31 or not

JASON
Its a rough plan Guy What does it matter if were doing
episode 31 or not

GUY
BECAUSE I DIED IN EPISODE 31
ALEXANDER

(interrupting)
This is ludicrous Why are you listening to this man Must I
remind you that he is wearing a costume not a uniform Hes

no more equipped to lead us than THIS fellow
(motions to Guy)
No offense

5499 (GOLDENROD)

TOMMY
You have a better plan Alex

ALEXANDER

As a matter of fact I do Look at their eyes Theyre obviously
nocturnal Come sundown they will go into the forest to hunt

So our plan is simply to wait for nightfall instead of mounting
an insane assault in full daylight simply because we did it that
way in episode 31

The others look convinced Jason looks down defeated Everyone
starts to settle in to wait for SUNDOWN

67 EXT RIDGE OVERLOOKING MINING OUTPOST - DUSK 67

Two hours later the SUN is setting Everyone rises to begin
their assault as the last glow sinks Into the horizon They
start forward when THE SECOND SUN (the BIG one) rises up
behind them lighting the planet brightly The actors turn to
Alexander who looks away sheepishly Jason smiles vindicated
and stands back in charge

JASON
As I was saying Fred we need some sort of diversion Some
sort of Hologram or optical illusion or

He looks at Fred who looks up at him completely lost

FRED
A hologram

JASON
(gently)
Never mind Fred

FRED
No no Ill think on it

GWEN
Jason look

They all look down to see that the blue demons have already
deserted the complex

TOMMY
Theyre gone
GUY
Whered they go Back inside

5499 (GOLDENROD)

GWEN
I dont know

ALEXANDER
Nobody was WATCHING

JASON

All right Gwen Alex Fred follow me Guy set up the
perimeter Tommy you keep a lookout make a signal if they come

back

TOMMY
What kind of signal

JASON
Anything

TOMMY

Okay Ill do this
(barely audible)

Caw Caw

JASON
Tommy we have these

He motions to his vox

TOMMY
Oh right sorry

JASON
Okay lets go

Jason Gwen Alex and Fred start down the hillside leaving Tommy
and Guy alone They stand there for a second looking at each

other

TOMMY
You have no idea what a perimeter is do you

GUY
Not a clue You

TOMMY
I think he just likes pointing at things

68 OMIT 68
69 DOWN THE RIDGE 69

Jason is in full action mode He uses dramatic

commando tactics
hes acted on the show such as ducking behind a
5499 (GOLDENROD)

rock peeking out rolling on the ground to the next rock Gwen
Alex and Fred just stroll down casually behind him

GWEN
How does the rolling help actually

JASON
It helps

A beat

GWEN
Wheres your gun

He pats his hip the gun is gone It has obviously fallen over
the cliff in his roll

ALEXANDER
It helps

70 CLEARING ON THE RIDGE 70

Tommy keeps a lookout through the binoculars Below Jason and
the others sneak into the compound and head toward the sphere
The abandoned compound is spooky A battered metal door sways in
the wind with a CREAK

GWEN
Those blue things ate everybody here

ALEXANDER
It doesnt make sense Surely they could have fortified the
compound against those creatures

Fred passes a metal console with a number of broken
viewscreens One however is partially intact Fred pushes a
button and the viewscreen lights up with a blurry VIDEO PLAYBACK
of MAYHEM Through a DUSTSTORM we see a number of ALIEN MINERS
run panicked through the compound We hear thunderous CRASHES
like FOOTSTEPS A TERRIFIED MINER - face wrapped in cloth except
for the eyes - stares into the camera mumbling out of his mind
with fear

MINER

Gorignak Gorignak

The image goes blank The actors look at each other
JASON

Anybody want to wait around to find out what a Gorignak is

(MORE)
5499 (GOLDENROD)

JASON (contd)
(they shake their heads no
Lets do this

GWEN
Clenched jaw

JASON
Will you stop RIDING ME

71 ON THE RIDGE 71

Tommy looks down onto the compound with binoculars to see Jason
and the others below moving toward the beryllium sphere He PANS
to the compound Good no blue children

GUY
I know what it is I know what it is Its not whats ON the
planet It IS the planet

As Guy continues to babble his theory TOMMY pans back and forth
between JASON and the others at the SPHERE and the deserted
COMPLEX Jason and the others start to ROLL the sphere It
moves forward witha We PAN OVER to see a blue HAND
emerge from one of the structures Tommy looks concerned

GUY (0OS)

Theres a life force here The blue things Did you see how
they moved Careful Quiet Like they didnt want something
DISTURBED

TOMMYS POV from THE SPHERE RUMBLING forward to THE DEMON
CHILDREN EMERGING FROM THE MINING STRUCTURES

TOMMY
Oh Shit
72 DOWN AT THE MINING COMPOUND 72

Jason and the others strain to push the boulder toward the
incline

JASON
Cmon push Never give up never surrender

EVERYONE
Oh shut up

Suddenly they all FREEZE as they notice the returning DEMONS The
monsters gather around them forming a vicious circle of
slavering teeth Silence for a beat then

5499 (GOLDENROD) QA

TOMMY ON VOX Caw Caw

ALEXANDER
Spare me

Suddenly a series of MAGNITO-PISTOL BLASTS ring out melting
random pieces of equipment walls and putting holes in the
walkways The aliens SCATTER for cover Gwen and the others
turn to see TOMMY coming with the gun in his hand followed by
Guy

TOMMY
Sorry Guys It just went off

JASON
Good work Tommy Lets go

They PUSH the over the lip of the incline It starts to roll on
its own

73 INCLINE 73

Jason and the others run with all their might to keep up with the
sphere Jason looks over his shoulder then turns forward

JASON
Dont look back DO NOT look back

Gwen cant resist She looks back to see HUNDREDS OF BLUE
DEMONS coming over the hillside like a TIDAL WAVE

74 NEAR THE SURFACE POD 74

The actors roll the sphere to the pod and up the pod ramp But
the boulder now blocks the pod door Gwen helps Guy inside then
squeezes through herself followed by Tommy Alexander and Jason

both motion each other forward

ALEXANDER
Go ahead

JASON
You go first Theres no time

ALEXANDER

Oh of course I forgot YOU have to be the hero dont you
Heaven forbid anyone else get the spotlight once Oh no Jason
Nesmith couldnt possibly-

Jason cold cocks him knocking him unconscious and lifts him
through then starts to squeeze through himself

75 INT SURFACE POD 75

JASON

Tommy pushes the button when suddenly Jason is GRABBED BY THE
ANKLE by FIVE PAIRS OF DEMON HANDS and dragged back outside just
as the door closes behind him

GWEN
Oh my god Tommy Stop the pod Stop the pod

TOMMY
I cant Its on autopilot

As they pod ascends they all move to the window to watch
horrified as Jason disappears into the middle of the huge blue
mob that surrounds him Alexander regains consciousness looks
around

ALEXANDER
He knocked me out the sonofabitch Where is he

GWEN
(horrified)

Down there

Alexander joins the others looks down at the blue mob below

ALEXANDER
Oh right of course Its always about YOU isnt it
76 EXT PLANET SURFACE 76

Back at the surface Jason is surrounded by the menacing DEMONS
who stare down at him with their chilling SMILES Their strange
whispered language is translated into SUBTITLES

DEMON 1
What do you suppose it is

DEMON 2
(momentarily introspective)
I dont know Strange it looks like a child

DEMON 1
What should I do

5499 (GOLDENROD)

DEMON 2
Hit it with a rock Then well eat it

Demon 1 lifts a rock and Jason doesnt have time to object
before the demon CLUBS him They lean in their mouths opening
for the kill when a SHADOW washes over them A Blue Demon looks
up over his shoulder TERRIFIED He whispers a meek

The pod door opens and Gwen Alexander and the others exit out
of breath Theyre greeted three of the Generator Room Techs as
well as Teb

cannibals Teb reset the pod were going back

TOMMY

right now

EXT PLANET SURFACE - ROCKY TRENCH

Jason lies unconscious on the ground We hear a SNORT and see
his shoulder moved by a large alien SNOUT Jason opens his eyes
to see a GRUNTING BEAST like an oversized pig but

5499 (GOLDENROD)

somewhat reptilian From above along the rock walls Jason can
hear the sound of the blue demons WHISPERING

DEMONS
Gorignak Gorignak

Jason rises quickly reaches for his gun but its gone Looking
for a weapon he quickly removes his shirt and SNAPS it at the
beast trying to drive it away The beast CHOMPS at him holding
its territory Suddenly Gwens voice sounds

GWEN (ON VOX)
Jason Can you hear me

JASON
Yes Yes Im here

80 INT SHIP - DIGITAL CONVEYER ROOM 80
Gwen Alexander and the others watch Jason on a viewscreen

GWEN
Thank God Are you okay

JASON
Yeah But Ive got Gorignak staring me in the face I think I can
take it though

GWEN

Jason were going to use the digital conveyer to get you out of
there

Jason swipes at the pig lizard It HISSES at him petulantly
JASON

The digital conveyer You mean Im going to get diced into cubes

and sorted up there in a thousand pieces

FRED
Right

JASON
Ill take my chances with Gorignak

The pig Lizard NIPS at Jason Jason throws a rock at it
GWEN
Jason weve got to get you out of there Its perfectly safe
isnt it Teb

TEB
It has never been successfully tested

JASON
What What did he say

GWEN
Nothing Hold please

She switches off the vox they turn to Teb

TEB

Theoretically the mechanism is fully operational However it was
built to accommodate your anatomy not ours Our actual hands are
six fingered and jointed ninety degrees to yours But now that
Sergeant Chen is here he can operate it It was designed
watching his motions from the historical records

Everyone turns to Fred For the first time he looks a little
apprehensive He laughs nervously

FRED
Well I mean I cant I can supervise of course but

ALEXANDER (TO VOX)
Jason were going to test it

JASON
Okay On what

TOMMY
How about the pig-lizard

JASON
Hey I was doing okay with the pig lizard

Alexander and the others move aside to let Fred at the control
panel The controls are complicated and fit Freds hand like

metal gloves Teb GASPS as he grasps the controls

TEB
Im sorry It is very exciting to see the master at the controls
The operation of the conveyer is more art than science

Fred moves his hands and the creature is TARGETED in crosshairs
of the instrument panel He slowly twists his wrist as he
manipulates a ever cautiously and

81 ON THE PLANETS SURFACE 81

The pig lizard digitizes and disappears

82 CONVEYOR ROOM 82
Everyone LOOKS very impressed Fred starts to smile no sweat
as the creature rematerializes on the platform But something is
very wrong We hear the things HORRIBLE SQUELS over the
disgusted reactions of the crew

JASON
What What

ALEXANDER
(singsong)
Nothing

JASON
I heard something A squeal

GWEN
Oh no Everythings fine

TEB
But the animal is inside out

JASON
I heard that Its INSIDE OUT

Then the monstrous remains of the creature EXPLODES

TEB
And It exploded

JASON
What Did I just hear that It came back INSIDE CUT and then It
EXPLODED Hello

GWEN
Hold please

83 PLANET SURFACE 83

Jason looks up to the rock ledge The unseen DEMONS continue to
chant GORIGNAK GORIGNAK

JASON
Wait the pig lizard is gone Why are they still chanting for the
pig lizard

GWEN
Turn on the translation circuit

Teb flicks a switch and we hear the Demons in English

DEMONS
ROCK ROCK ROCK

Suddenly Gwen and the others notice that the entire ROCK FACE
behind Jason moves slightly like a granite MUSCULATURE Jason
facing forward doesnt see it
GWEN
Jason I dont think the pig lizard was Gorignak

JASON
What the hell are you talking about

Behind Jason the boulders in the wall begin moving forward
EMERGING from the rock face and a GIANT emerges A MONSTER
made of granite Jason turns slowly with a feeling of dread
as he hears the rumbling SOUND of the monsters body freeing
itself from the rock face around It

JASON
Oh darn

He takes a step back holding his puny wooden spear The ROCK
MONSTER steps forward 20 feet tall Its face mostly featureless
yet ominous and determined and upset and it heads straight for
JASON

JASON
Guys digitize me

Jason backs away slowly around the corner but the monster
follows CRUNCH CRUNCH forward

Fred backs away terror on his face He starts talking to

himself nervously

FRED
All my professional life theyd say can you ride a horse Fred
And Id say Of course since I was a boy Can you fence
Fred Funny you should ask Ive won six international
competitions I learned never to say I cant do this You
dont get the part if you say I cant do this But this is life
or death May God forgive me Jason but I cant do this

85 ON THE PLANET

Jason is in a FULL OUT RUN being chased by the ROCK MONSTER which
STOMPS forward DEMOLISHING everything in its path

ALEXANDER
Freds no good Jason Youre going to have to kill it

JASON

TOMMY

JASON

TOMMY

sort of rudimentary lathe

JASON

The monsters shadow falls over Jason

JASON
ALEXANDER PLEASE Youre my advisor advise me

ALEXANDER

JASON

ALEXANDER

Thats your problem You were never serious about the caraft
(closing his eyes)

Im a rock I just want to be a rock Still Peaceful

Tranquil Oh but whats this Somethings making noise
No not noise no MOVEMENT VIBRATIONS Make the vibrations
stop they go straight into me like a knife I must CRUSH the

thing that makes the vibrations

JASON
Am I crazy or do you actually have something there

Jason reaches down and grabs a handful of small rocks But at
that moment the rock monster reaches down and GRABS him in his
fist Jason is carried into the air and dangled above the beasts
mouth Jason keeps his composure enough to toss one of the rocks
at a natural rocky OVERRANG along one wall The thrown rocks
dislodge a few more rocks in the wall which TUMBLE to the ground
making NOISE The rock monster TURNS toward the sound The
monster drops Jason Jason lands throws another rock The
monster CHARGES toward the wall causing an AVALANCHE burying
the monster All is still

86 IN THE SHIP 86
The actors CHEER but their relief is short lived as

87 ON THE PLANET - 87
The rubble RE-FORMS and the monster EMERGES even LARGER than
before It begins to make a beeline for a perplexed Jason

JASON
But Im not moving I Oh no My heartbeat

IN THE ROCK MONSTERS POV we head toward Jason and hear Jasons
heartbeat magnified like a drum THA-THUMP THA-THUMP

JASON

Fred Fred can you hear me Youve got to do this Its up
to you

88 ON THE SHIP - 88

Fred moves to the panel mortified

FRED
No Ill kill you

JASON

Listen Fred You did this for four years on the show You can do
it now Put your hands on the controls

Fred puts his trembling hands on the controls Sweat pours down
his temple

FRED

I dont know I dont know

The monster picks up speed STOMP STOMP STOMP

JASON

Fred I worked summer stock with Hopkins Regional theater with
Hoffman But I swear to God I have never met an actor who could
hit his mark or nail his lines with the professional consistency
of a Freddy Kwan Youre Mr Dependable You can do this

FRED
You worked with Hopkins I worship Hopkins

Fred draws confidence from these words The Monster is upon
Jason It raises its fist

JASON
Digitize me Fred

A moment of concentration - as everybody holds their breath - and
then Fred works the controls Jason is STILL THERE and

89 THE MONSTER SMASHES DOWN HIS FIST RIGHT DOWN ONTO JASON
at the very moment he digitizes The fist goes right through the
scattering blocks Everybody on ship holds their breath and
watches the
90 DIGITIZING PLATFORM 90

Jasons body Instantly DUCKS and CONTORTS to avoid the ROCK FIST
that moments ago descended uoon him Everyone runs up to him as
he regains his composure celebrating hugging him and patting
him on the back Even Alexander looks relieved but wont admit
it

ALEXANDER
I see you managed to get your shirt off

Jason looks over and sees Fred still at the controls drenched
He moves to him and shakes his trembling hand

FRED

JASON
Hopkins cant drink your bathwater Fred

Fred wells with pride Jason turns to the others

JASON

JASON
Weve got to get out of here Cmon hurry

But as they head toward the door it OPENS revealing SARRIS AND
A DOZEN OF HIS MEN guns drawn The actors back away except
for Jason who stands his ground as Sarris approaches

JASON
Listen Sarris just hold on just-

But Sarris BACKHANDS him brutally Jason crashes to the floor
Jason starts to stand wiping blood from his mouth but with a
nod from Sarris six of his men surround Jason and begin to kick
and beat him on the ground brutally
91-92 OMIT
93 INT BARRACKS PRISON 93

The row of barracks down the long hallway have been converted to
prison cells From inside these the hundreds of captured ALIENS
watch in despair as JASON BLOODY AND BEATEN is led down the
corridor Sarris his guards and the other crewmembers follow
behind Weak and semi-conscious from the beating Jason stumbles
and falls Sarris produces a device and applies it to Jasons
neck Jason cries out his entire

body convulses The aliens push against the cell doors come to
his aid but the guards beat them back mercilessly

SARRIS
If you cannot walk Commander then I suggest you crawl

Jason hesitates Sarris SHOCKS him again Jason finally rises and
slowly begins to CRAWL forward Everyone is silent Numb

94 INT MEDICAL DECK 94

The area has been converted to an interrogation chamber Jason is
led in with the others Sarris men interrogate a man strapped
to a table They move aside to reveal Mathesar barely alive
But as he sees Jason a ray of hope lights up behind his eyes He
smiles

MATHESAR
Commander Thank God youre alive Now you will face justice
Sarris

SARRIS

(laughs)

At every turn you demonstrate the necessity for your
extermination The qualities of your species Ridiculous
optimism like little children Building always building But
what you spend years to create I take from you in days

(to Jason)

Do you wish to save this mans life Commander And the life of
your crew

JASON
Yes

SARRIS
Then tell me one thing What does it do the device The Omega

JASON

Sarris twists a dial Mathesar writhes in pain on the table
SARRIS
Is it a bomb A booby trap Tell me

JASON
Stop please I dont know

SARRIS
Prepare a tear harness for the female

JASON
No I swear I dont know Please

SARRIS
Do you think Im a fool That the Commander does not know every
bolt every weld of his ship

Gwen fights the guards valiantly as they drag her to a table

JASON
But Im not I Im not the Commander

Sarris turns Interested He motions his guards to halt

SARRIS
Wait What did you say

JASON
Please dont hurt them its not their fault Im not the
Commander I dont know anything

Mathesar looks at him bewildered Sarris looks Intrigued

SARRIS
Explain -

JASON

A screen lights up with the opening of the first GALAXY QUEST
episode We see the various actors in their roles freeze framed
in action poses intercut with the ship speeding through space

Sarris watches captivated Realization dawns on his face He
begins to laugh Sarris turns to Mathesar beaten and bloody
but hope lightening in his eyes as he watches the show That
tickles Sarris even more he ROARS with laughter

SARRIS

Oh this is wonderful Wonderful I treated you as a foe but
no You have done greater damage to these poor fools than I
ever could have Bravo Bravo

He puts his arm around Jason and leads him to face Mathesar
SARRIS
Tell him This is a moment I will treasure Explain who you
really are

Jason looks up at Mathesar A long pause

JASON
My name is Jason Nesmith Im an actor Were all actors

SARRIS
Our dimwitted friends dont understand the concept of acting
They have no theater no imagination these scientists

JASON
We pretend

SARRIS
Simpler

JASON

SARRIS
Yes You understand THAT dont you Mathesar

Mathesar looks up at Jason bewildered
JASON

JASON

Mathesar just stares Sarris watches eyes twinkling

JASON

Pretending to be Commander Peter Quincy Taggart Im Im so

sorry Mathesar

Mathesar looks away his eyes hollow all hope gone

SARRIS
Now you know This entire world youve concocted All based on
nothing Your beliefs your hopes All a dream A wisp of

smoke Now there is only pain

Sarris moves to his Lieutenant RAK LATHE

SARRIS

Lieutenant Lathe I confess I am beginning to feel a bit foolish
myself Chasing across the universe to obtain what is I am now
certain a bauble of fiction Tell me how best to obliterate this

vessel I would like nothing to remain

LATHE
The core could be hardwired to overload without much effort

MATHESAR
Sarris What about my men

Yes youre right Much too easy a death for the trouble you have
caused me Lieutenant open a vent on level C and let the

outside in a bit for our friends

A beat Enraged Jason LUNGES for Sarris but his men quickly
beat him down brutally

SARRIS
I guess an actor is not the same as a Commander after all

SARRIS
Release them Sergeant Into space

The Guard nods and escorts them out Sarris turns to
Mathesar and raises the torture control with a sick smile

outside of the airlock fighting The guards smile enjoying the
fight Jason quickly overpowers Alexander and punches him
repeatedly his anger taking hold They lock in a mutual
strangulation hold Then Jason pulls free He grabs Alex by the
collar and pulls back for the crowning blow

and deals a punisher right past Alexander into the face of
Guard 1 Alexander turns astonished realizing its all an
act A FLASH of an appreciative smile then he ELBOWS Guard

JASON
Brandon Just in case I die theres something I have to know

BRANDON
Yes Commander

JASON
What does the Omega 13 do

BRANDON
Well thats the big question isnt it

JASON
What do you mean

BRANDON

Its been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the
internet for years Many believe that is a matter collapser a
bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain
reaction lasting 13 seconds

JASON
But you dont
BRANDON

No I am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter
killer but a matter REARRANGER converting all molecules to the
exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation
thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past

JASON
How did you come to that conclusion

BRANDON
My cousins boyfriends sister went out with the screenwriter
His favorite movie is the Omegaman Hes seen it 13 times

KYLE

As you know I strenuously disagree with this theory Brandon if
all molecules were rearranged then everyone would be back in
time 13 seconds rendering the device useless

Suddenly a BLAST erupts next to Jasons head He and Gwen turn
to see SARRIS MEN shooting at them from across the room at the
entrance to the cavern

JASON
Okay guys Guys

But the gang is still caught up in the debate

KATELYN

No because the brain of the person who triggers the Omega 13 is
not affected so THAT person still has his memory after the time
jump And everything is as it was a chance to redeem a single
mistake or misstep

BRANDON
Thank you Katelyn Excellent

KATELYN
(flattered shy)

Youre welcome Brandon

Jason and Gwen RUN as Sarris men continue to snoot at them

through the crusher but is toppled by one of the crushers and
falls into the fake looking lava pit Hollister times the pattern
of the crushers with a stopwatch

HOLLISTER
Okay the pattern is two two four two three
eight two

important

Cut from the cardboard props to the REAL THING

We shouldnt have to DO this It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE Why is
it HERE

JASON
Because it was on the show

He moves to Quellek at the doorway

ALEXANDER

Okay Quellek lets get back to the command deck and-Suddenly we
hear a PISTOL BLAST and Quelleks chest turns RED Alexander and
Quellek look down at the blood horrified

QUELLEK

He falls CRUMPLED to the ground We see one of Sarris GUARDS
down the hall He shoots again Alexander grabs Quelleks limp
body and pulls him out of the line of fire

ALEXANDER

Quellek opens his eyes weakly Alexander pulls aside his uniform
to see the wound It s a mortal injury Alexander uses all of
his acting skills to disguise his shock

ALEXANDER
Not so bad Well get you to medical quarters Youre going to be
fine

QUELLEK

ALEXANDER
No dont talk like that son Were going to get you fixed up

QUELLEK

your example these years my life has had meaning I have been
blessed Sir I I

He cringes in pain Alexander looks at him full of emotion

ALEXANDER
Dont speak Quellek

QUELLEK
Youll forgive my impertinence sir but even though we had never
before met always considered you as a father to me

Blood appears in the corner of Quelleks mouth his life fading
away Alexander strokes his head devastated He looks him right
in the eyes his eyes welling with tears Then with intensity
and absolute sincerity

ALEXANDER
Quellek By Grabthars hammer by the suns of Warvan You
shall be avenged

Quelleks appreciation of this is Indescribable A tiny spark
behind his eyes light up and he smiles completely content as he
surrenders to death

Tears fall down Alexanders cheek as he holds Quelleks limp
body Then a blast hits a corner nearby Alexander lays
Quelleks head to the ground softly then rises There is an
Intensity to him we havent seen before His eyes BURN

Alexander moves into the hallway fixing his attention on Sarris
man The guard looks up momentarily shaken Alexander hooks

fires twice missing Alexander begins to RUN toward the guard
picking up speed The guard tries to reload his gun but his eyes
are locked on Alexander like a frightened animal and his
