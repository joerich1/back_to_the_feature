EXT FOREST - DUSK
A gorgeous vista green and lush

Beneath the canopy of branches a small brook babbles over
moss covered rocks

A bullfrog CROAKS loudly from its perch atop what looks
like a human leg

Sure enough it’s attached to A BODY semi-submerged in the
water -- unrecognizable in the rapidly darkening light

BEGIN CREDITS

TIME ELLIPSE Dusk gives way to night The moon casts a
blue hue over the woods The sun rises illuminating the
body for the first time

It’s PAUL His clothing is largely torn away revealing
purple flesh swollen with open sores There is the dull hum
of swarming flies

A shaft of sun carves its way through the thick nest of
branches and creeps across the glistening water It travels
Paul’s torso up to his neck As the light hits his face
his eyelids unexpectedly BURST OPEN and Paul tries to scream
but only rasping air escapes his lips

As he struggles to his feet - blood puss even small chunks
of skin splash into the water

We follow the swirling GORE as it’s carried off downstream

EXT FOREST - CONTINUOUS

PULL BACK widening our view of the forest and following the
route of the stream

We RACE its course across a meadow until we reach

EXT WATER BOTTLING PLANT - MORNING
CLOSE ON a sign reading “Down Home Spring Water”

The stream dead ends into a man made pond from which
protrude several enormous steel pipes

INT BOTTLING PLANT - CONTINUOUS

We follow the pipes into the plant and then the route of the
water through the production line The water gets pumped
into holding tanks then into the individual bottles The
company slogan appears on each and every plastic container
“Down Home Purity - From Us to You”

EXT FOREST —- MORNING LATER

Paul looks around dizzily for orientation Dense forest on
three sides Beside him a steep embankment and at its
crest he sees something A passing CAR A road

He takes a few steps clearly intent to make the climb then
notices something on his bare chest A leech He plucks it
away And sees another And another He’s covered in them

He panics tearing them off his flesh with wild-eyed disgust
each bloated leech leaving behind an oozing wound

EXT EMBANKMENT MOMENTS LATER

Paul crawls his way up the steep incline The progress is
taxing CRACK His ankle buckles twisting at a sharp angle
and shooting a thick stream of blood

Paul’s watering eyes squeeze closed but he does not stop

EXT ROAD MOMENTS LATER

Paul reaches the summit his heart pounding in his head The
world is spinning as he limps delirious into the road

WHAP A school bus smashes through Paul instantly
liquefying him and exploding his contents over the front
grill His remains are shotput twenty yards then cartwheel
down the embankment and SPLASH land back into the stream

The bus wheels screech as the vehicle skids to a stop The
road fills with the sound of SCREAMING CHILDREN

EXT ROAD ACCIDENT SCENE - LATER

The school bus and its hysterical occupants are surrounded by
lit flares The unconscious BUS DRIVER is loaded into a
waiting ambulance

The only other officials on the scene - two FOREST RANGERS
one male one female - are pulling barricades across the
road She’s young and frumpy The Male Ranger 20s
buzzcut is clearly quite high on his responsibilities

A SHERIFF’S CRUISER arrives lights flashing The door opens
and WINSTON’S booted leg glides to the pavement He
approaches the bus full swagger in his step

END CREDITS
INT BUS - CONTINUOUS

It’s mayhem Kids are screaming crying some have already
been sick and others are on the verge

REVEAL Winston impatiently competing for their attention

WINSTON

Kids I’m Deputy Winston

(no response)
All right now If we can all just
settle down Settle Everything
is under control

(still nothing)
All right I’m going to need you
to shut up Just shut the hell up

The wailing intensifies Winston tugs his hair in
frustration then pulls his GUN This seems to work A
HUSH falls over the bus The kids stare saucer-eyed

WINSTON
Good Thank you Now look the
bus seems to have hit a moose or
something We’re gonna get you off
to school very soon okay

A LITTLE BOY raises his hand Winston lets the boy wait a
moment before calling on him

WINSTON
Yeah

LITTLE BOY
Can I go to the baf-room

A chorus of high-pitched voices erupt Everyone has to go to
the goddamn bathroom Winston’s world threatens to plunge
back into chaos so he holds up his gun a reminder The
HUSH descends Winston indicates to the boy

WINSTON
What number

The boy slowly raises two fingers
WINSTON
No No fucking way
EXT ROAD ACCIDENT SCENE LATER
Winston is done Investigation over In the background the

Male Ranger is dutifully inspecting the bus Winston and the
Female Ranger light cigarettes
WINSTON
So how’s it going
(awkwardly flirtatious)
I got a forty in my cruiser

The Male Ranger peels a strip of bloody cloth out of the
buses grill It’s part of a pants leg

MALE RANGER
Found something Don’t think deer
wear American Eagle

WINSTON
It was a deer Let’s get these
kids to school or home Wherever
the fuck they go

The Male Ranger has now followed the splatter to the edge of
the embankment He looks down and calls out

MALE RANGER
There’s a trail of blood - seems to
go down this hill

WINSTON
Okay then - let’s wrap things up

The Male Ranger approaches gets right in Winston’s face

MALE RANGER
Look something died here and I
take that real serious You need
to go somewhere that’s fine by me
I’ll put it in my report I know
over-promoted incompetence when I
see it “Deputy”

FEMALE RANGER
Maybe we should check into this a
little further
Winton sighs deeply worn down
WINSTON
Fine Fine We’1ll poke around a
bit Jesus
The rumble of an approaching large vehicle -- it’s a Down
Home Water Bottle delivery truck Winston waves it past

INT MT VERNON HIGH SCHOOL - LUNCHROOM
Kids are eating talking horsing around

The Driver pushes the water across the length of the
lunchroom Kids bob and weave out of his way

He pulls up to the front of the line and hoists a CASE OF
BOTTLED WATER onto the counter The LUNCH LADY glares at
him annoyed

LUNCH LADY
Yeah just drop that anywhere

A SKINNY GIRL moving through the line reaches for one of the
driver’s new bottles As her hand touches it she hesitates
and then decides on a SODA

A FAT GIRL moving through the line reaches for one of the
bottles She hesitates Instead she grabs two large
CHOCOLATE MILKS

ZACH our hero pulls a water right from the case He’s a
small guy with obvious potential and kind features

Waiting for the Lunch Lady’s attention he opens the bottle
and is JUST ABOUT TO SIP when A HAND SMACKS it away from his
lips The open bottle skitters across the floor

Zach turns to face DOUG a towering beady-eyed asshole

DOUG
(under his breath)
Oops sorry faggot

Doug waltzes off Zach grabs an Orange Juice

LUNCH LADY

We’ve barely spoke since

CHRIS

SHAMS
I can’t believe you saw Brooke
naked and your head didn’t fucking

surprisingly little pain

SHAMS
Good to know So What was it
that Lord Chris wanted exactly

Zach averts his friends eyes hesitant uncomfortable

INT “HAMBURGER HUT” - AFTERNOON

Brooke breezes in and takes a seat alone by the window
She’s all in black and looks both moody and intimidating

Their heads turn in unison Zach’s snaps back mortified

ZACH
(quietly)
Hey Let’s not stare okay

ERIC

Before anyone can get a word in edgewise Shams is moving
across the diner Zach’s heart rockets into his throat

ZACH’S POV Shams approaches Brooke Introduces himself

seat They keep talking Brooke starts LAUGHING

Suddenly Brooke stands and » Still

BROOKE

deeply and speaks rapidly not missing a beat

ZACH

my request - but I’m not entirely
upset because I’ve been meaning to
talk to you for a long time Now
that I have your attention I’d like
to say I think you’re very
intriguing not to mention quite
beautiful I’ve secured an
invitation to Chris’s party which
at the very least promises to be
very memorable Of course tonight
is also prom and due to the
previously discussed “lack of
balls” condition from which I
suffer I have no date If you
also are without a date I’d be
sublimely excited and deeply
honored to take you

She stares at him - then smiles flattered and charmed

bedroom It’s not too far away

Jack reaches the lip of the eave He rests for a moment
SQUAP A knuckle pops Blood spurts on his tux

He looks down again The ground appears to be swaying His
breath comes in huge rasps

JACK
(very faint)
Help Help me

In one motion he SWINGS himself up landing on the roof He
is on his stomach spread-eagle on the black asphalt
shingles He lays his cheek on the stubbly surface

white rim He looks up at the bedroom Natasha is inside
changing Despite the pain Jack is momentarily distracted
She’s a hottie

a mouthful of blood before passing out

of know what can happen from there

Morose silence

DOUG

ZACH
What we need to do is be extremely
careful--

time - Bob loses his balance toppling down the staircase and
landing on the basement floor with a sickening CRUNCH

INT MT VERNON HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Winston wanders the halls the carnage of Doug’s passage all
around him bodies in the hall smashed lockers severed
electrical wiring resulting in sputtering lights overhead

He comes upon the three dead Preppie Kids He considers them
for a LONG BEAT

WINSTON
(to himself)
Best to handle this the Bunyon
County way

QUICK SERIES OF CUTS Winston emerges from the Chemistry
Classroom wearing a thick rubber apron long latex gloves
and carrying bottles of Isopropyl Alcohol

He laboriously drags the bodies into a haphazard pile

He empties the Alcohol over the corpses

He retrieves a silver Zippo from a pocket and sets them on
fire Whistling he walks away

INT MT VERNON HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Doug twirls the axe absentmindedly like a lumberjack on a
morning stroll

He rounds a corner and finds himself face-to-face with three
fleeing members of the STUDENT BAND Each are lugging their
beloved instruments and look utterly terrified

It’s a “West Side Story” gangland stand-off the axe-wielding
maniac ve the DRUMMER the SAXOPHONIST and the VIOLINIST

The Saxophonist cocks the heavy brass behind his body As
he’s about to attack Doug swings the Axe- hitting him IN
THE ANKLE The Saxophonist goes down

Doug then turns on the other two swinging wildly narrowly
missing The drummer assaults Doug with the Crash Cymbal
He pulls back again carving a deep slice of arm before the
disk CLATTERS to the floor

Doug swings the axe upwards IT OBLITERATES the violin then
strikes the violinist on the inner thigh SPLOTCH

Doug has trouble getting the axe back out of the deep wound
The VIOLINIST HOWLS in pain

Using one cymbal as a shield another as a weapon the
Drummer redoubles his assault

Doug abandons the axe letting it dangle between the
SCREAMING violinist’s legs He picks the Cymbal from the
floor and throws it like a Frisbee It slices through the
drummer’s neck striking the WINDPIPE AND VIBRATES GONG

His work done Doug reclaims the axe with a sickening WET
SQUELCH He continues on his merry way leaving the three
bleeding writhing victims in his wake

quite a beating and the left side of his face has been
turned to pulp Blood spills over his fingers

head repeatedly DING CLICK CHING

Doug writhes in pain

wrests it away from Doug but trips over Winston and lands on
the blade A pool of biood slowly forms beneath her fallen
form Doug snatches her rake

Zach and Doug face off Its garden rake against garden hoe

DOUG
