Story of G I Joe

Over the title of the picture come the words of a song

Tve gone away for to stay a little while but Im coming back --

Im coming back if it be one-

A

The BIVOUAC in the desert fades in

to break over the distant hi

the night is still on the scene

thousand miles

Dawn is just beginning
The chill and half-dark of
But now theres a great

ls

sense of stir and activity There is a grinding roar of

motors as troop trucks
about taking on their loads
uncoiling to form a thin sna
beginning to head off across

jeeps and armored cars maneuver

of men and artillery and
e of a line that is just
the desert floor to the

distant hills to the right A Sergeant is supervising

Next the view weaving throug

discloses some of its action
supplies grind past as they swing into line

the movement of the convoy
Trucks loaded with men and
a jeep

jouncing down the line like a shepherd dog men on the

double-quick run toward truc
still waiting their turn in

s that are loading up while
ine Then we see the TROOP

TRUCK as several GIs pile into it and move to the fore

Foremost is Gawky

Lopez Mew Dondaro As they
raw-boned business-like fel

into the scene from the right Gawkys pup
lets out a yip Without breaking his stride
Walker scans the truck and heads toward Gawky

exuberance

moving in

WALKER
(with a sharp

with a pup still cuddled in his arms
Behind him pile in several other GIs

among them Murphy

do so Lieutenant Walker a
ow of twenty-six strides
in its

the view

between-the

-teeth whistle at Gawky)

Hey you-- Hey you Get that pooch out
of there Whataya want to do get him
killed

(Gawky looks up disturbed

he hesitates for a moment)

Awright Awright

He goes on

Quit stalling

not waiting to see whether his order will be

carried out he knows it will

WARNICKI

All right
lieutenant

all right

you heard the

We get a close moving view of the GIs and the PUP

Reluctantly hungrily Gawky
man who now silently passes
on to another GI
Mew

who then nudges Mew
having missed Walkers order

passes the pup on to the next
it on to Murphy who hands it
whose back is turned
delightedly receives the
dog and starts to pet it The man beside him nudges him and
gestures out Mews face falls he pulls the pup apart
from a button the mutts playfully begun to chew and
reluctantly hands him on to the next man who silently
passes him down the line As the hands of each man leave
the dog theres a lingering reluctance in their gesture
as if the very warmth and furry softness of the little
animal body gave them a sense of something they knew theyd
never find again in this arid desert -- something theyd
want to cling to

WARNICKI
Ah you poor little fella youre
going to freeze out there

Dondaro receiving the pup at the end of the truck hasnt
got the heart to toss it away For a moment he doesnt know
what to do Suddenly he drops it to someone off the truck
The view moving and stopping on Ernie who had approached
the truck a moment before we see him lugging his bedroll
and duffle bag Somewhat startled Ernie holds the pup and
looks up just as the view widens to include Walker coming
into the scene

ERNIE
What do you want me to do with it

We then see the BACK of the TRUCK the view featuring WALKER
and ERNIE -- with the GIs in the background Walker is
about to order Ernie to get rid of the mutt but at the same
instant he catches a glimpse of the GIs their eyes all
hungrily directed at the pup in Ernies arms His eyes shift
away A little smile plays about his lips He seizes on
Ernies armband as an excuse to countermand his order
without seeming to do so

WALKER
(briskly)

Correspondent huh Well you want
to get up to the front dont you
(Over his shoulder)

Here make room for this man

Remembering Walkers former order Ernie starts to set the
pup down but Walker intercepts him

WALKER
Well get in get in Make it snappy

For an instant the two mens eyes meet A flash of
understanding passes between them Walker briskly
turns and walks away -- the cop who wasnt there

WALKER
(going off toward
his seat in front)
All right lets get moving
Ernie quickly starts to scramble up the truck pup in one
arm bedroll and duffle-bag dragged behind him with the
other He hands the pup on to Dondaro who quickly passes
it on and cheerfully gives Ernie a lift

text missing

For a brief instant Ernie looks resentfully at Dondaro This
is the second time this guys called him Pop But he grins
as he sees in a close moving view the pup being passed
back from hand to hand on its way to Gawky The rhythm of
the camera movement has a quicker more joyous tempo this
time The view stops on Gawky as he finally gets the pup
Gawky in his delight quickly reaches in his pocket for a
can of C rations and he holds it out to the pup The pup
sniffs it and growls at it -- The boys laughter is free
easy exuberant now The tension is broken Alls well

with the world They and Gawky have their pup back

We get a close view of the TRUCK WHEEL It spins in the sand
as the motor is heard starting Perhaps that yelp of delight
that comes over the scene is from the pup -- or perhaps its
just the truck wheel biting into the sand and starting
forward Next the view moves up slightly as the truck spins
around bringing the rear of the truck into focus and we see
Ernie still being hauled onto the truck by the seat of his
pants Then as the truck moves on and off into the desert
the scene dissolves to a long moving view of the convoy
rolling along a desert road Its mid-day and the sun beats
down on the GIs

Inside the TROOP TRUCK Ernie is seated next to Dondaro
Opposite and alongside are the rest of the gang Although
his presence is accepted hes still outside their tight
little clique He listens with amused interest to their
jabber The boys are keyed up not tense -- but full of the
fizz and vinegar of young healthy animals confined in a
small space on their way to the big game

DONDARO
Got a cigarette

Ernie reaches into his pocket and hands Dondaro a pack
Dondaro takes one and without thinking twice passes the
pack along to the rest of the boys Ernie watches the
progress of the pack around the truck

MEW
Hey Gawky whatre you going to
call that purp Betty Gordon

Gawky grins as everyone laughs Their spirits have risen
again

DONDARO
(calling down the line)
Lay off the Gawk Hes my territory
ERNIE and DONDARO are seen closely

ERNIE
Whos Betty Gordon

DONDARO
(shaking his head
laughing amiably)
Ah the kids been waiting for a
letter from her ever since we left
the States

Warnicki leans over and returns Ernies pack Its empty
He looks at it wryly Dondaro notices it

DONDARO
(with a nod toward
the boys)
Chain smokers
(Then)
Guess youre getting off at the first
airbase aint you Pop

ERNIE
Why

DONDARO

(ironically with a

touch of bitterness)
Correspondent aint you The fliers
are the guys you guys always write
about The Hollywood heroes Were
just the mugs along for the ride
thats all Just for the ride

(He looks across)
Ask Wingless Hell tell you

The view widens to include the others

MURPH
Yeah Just one plane and youre all
dead ducks Just one plane and
zZz-z-z-ang

Almost simultaneously with his voice a sharp screech of
brakes is heard The boys lurch forward Several
automatically look up as if expecting a plane

WALKER
All right men This is a break --
unload

And we see the rear of the truck as the boys Ernie among
them scramble off the truck Walker comes toward Ernie
WALKER

How far up you going Mr -- Mr
ERNIE
Pyle End of the line If its okay
with you
WALKER

(starting on)
Sure

(Then suddenly turning)
Pyle You say Pyle

(Ernie nods)
Say arent you the guy that runs
that column about week-end trips or
somethin

ERNIE
(grinning)
Mostly -- or something --
(Nodding toward the boys)
Pretty good-looking outfit you got

WALKER
Were not an outfit yet
(Glancing at his watch)
Maybe by this time tomorrow we will
be Say come to think of it my old
man reads your column He thinks its
great

Ernie looks up quickly at him The sharp piping of whistles
are heard all down the road

ERNIE
Well Ill be darned

WALKER
All right men -- lets get going--

The DESERT dissolves in at night First we get a close view
of the RADIOMAN on the JEEP He is sitting hunched up
blanket around his shoulders phones pressed to his ears
listening to the radio A smile comes to his face as if he
were hearing something delightful Grinning he removes the
earphones snaps on the loudspeaker so that the soft
rhythmic strains of a popular band orchestra can be heard

RADIOMAN
Hey fellas get a load of this --
Artie Shaw --

The view moves to the right disclosing in a medium long
shot a convoy bivouacked for the night Scores of pup tents
interspersed with trucks jeeps armored cars are spread
irregularly across the bright moonlit desert In the
distance only mountains and sky are visible
As the music softly floats across the night
in closer weaving past tents revealing the various
activities of the men preparatory to blanket drill Many

have their heads sticking out of the tents

reclining in various stages of relaxation

the view moves

Others are

The camera comes to a halt on a pair of enormous feet
sticking out of a tent flap Their owner evidently is too

big for the normal sized tent

of the tent to the front flap which is open
extends beyond that too He keeps staring at
studded sky

AD LIBS
Out of this world Solid Jack--

The view moves along the wall

The GIs head
the star-

Looking into the tent we see Murphy in the foreground

a thin medium-sized youngster his bunk mate is
huddling with the cold for the tent flap is
Charley Mew an Ohio farm boy a child of neglect naive and
wondering

Within

MEW
(not really complaining)
Gee whiz Murph -- I wish you werent
so long -- its sort of cold out here
in the open

MURPHY
(without turning)
Ill cut my legs off

MEW

(almost apologetically)
No geez you dont need to do
that

(Then something

on his mind)
I hear were getting into the real
business tomorrow

MURPHY
Well so far as Im concerned they
can deal me out

MEW
(concerned)
The infantry aint so worse--

MURPHY
(cutting in tersely)
Look this is a modern war aint
it Im a modern guy -- the modern
age is up in the air Thats where I
belong Not down here

open This is
MEW
They only washed you out because
youre too big It aint your fault

MURPHY
Ill cut my legs off

MEW
Me me me

Inside another TENT In the tent are Lopez and Sgt Warnicki
Lopez is obviously of Mexican extraction Warnicki a
muscular ex-coal miner He is stolidly polishing his
tommy-gun The music comes over

LOPEZ
What do you think I ought to bring
Maria and the little fellow when I
go back

Warnicki looks up abruptly from his gun polishing

WARNICKI
When you go home
(Grimly he sets about
polishing his gun again)
If and when you mean

The gun catches a glint of the moonlight Lopez catches a
glint of his meaning and nods solemnly

From another angle the view favoring GAWKY We see the mutt
licking Gawkys face He grins down at it

DONDARO
If you had to sneak something out of
that village whynt you bring
something in skirts--

Gawky is about to speak but Dondaro shushes him as a long
silvery trumpet note arrows softly into the night sky

DONDARO
Sh-- Listen--dont interrupt the
music--
(In ecstasy)
Murder--

The announcers voice is now heard coming over the radio
jeep It is a husky feminine seductive voice The radioman
listens delightedly

VOICE
This is Berlin playing the jive

music of Artie Shaw--

RADIOMAN
Thats our Sally--

VOICE

Nothing sweeter n hotter in the
world is there Remind you of
Rosalind Sylvia Phyllis Nancy
Mary Ellen Daisy yes you bet
it does summer nights the
juke-box down the road cokes
double malts a girls soft

laughter in the moonlight
Tomorrow you boys of the 18th
Infantry will meet our armies for

the first time the armies that
have beaten the world -- the French
the British the Russians -- What

chance do you stand--

SOLDIER
(reacting to her
propaganda)
Sez you -- Bring em on --

The view moves past the faces of the soldiers as they listen

VOICE
Why not be sensible -- be sensible
and surrender

SOLDIER
(ad lib)
Oh yeah

VOICE
Be my guests in Germany Dance with
our lovely girls -- They know how to
entertain nice young men like you

SOLDIER
(calling out)
Save one for me sister Ill be
right there

MEW
What a voice -- what a bedroom --
what a --
He clucks
VOICE

I will now sing Germanys latest hit

with lyrics written especially for

my nice handsome American friends
(Now heard singing)

Light for me a cigarette

In that small café where we met

Let me feel your finger tips
Linda Linda on my lips

Where two lovers used to be

Are these echoes waiting for me
And do you still wait for me too
As Linda my love I wait for you

The view focusses on DONDARO and others in scattered tents

DONDARO
Theres a piece of furniture Id
like to push around

SERGEANTS VOICE
(rasping)
Turn that radio off

The radio is instantly clicked off In the ensuing silence
some of the GIs quickly pull back into their tents And we
see the group fairly closely the view favoring Lopez as he
picks up his guitar

LOPEZ
(as he strums)
It was Nazi music Now its mine --
our first German prisoner

We get a long view of the mountains sky and desert And
over it comes Lopez soft strumming of Lili Marlene as if
the melody haunted the scene The view moves slowly away
from the landscape to the bivouac passing a lone sentry
pacing up and down then resting for a moment on Dondaro
his feet out of the tent He hums as he gazes dreamily at
the sky A little beyond him is Gawky fast asleep a smile
on his grimy face as the mutt snuggles its muzzle under his
chin

DONDARO

(after humming some more)

Pst -- hey Pop
(Ernie turns instinctively
though resentfully at this
designation but Dondaro
continues brashly)

Why wasnt you born a beautiful dame
(Then as an afterthought)

Or even an ugly one

Ernie half grinning a little uncomfortably a little
nervously doesnt quite know how to take it

VOICES
(ad lib)
Hey why dont you guys pipe down

DONDARO
Awright Awright
(And we see him closely
as he turns over gazing

at the sky)
Tonight boys -- tonight I dream in
technicolor

We get a fairly close view of Ernie still cold and
uncomfortable lying on the ground for the first time as

the scene slowly dissolves to a CURVE of ROAD The convoy of
trucks is still moving forward The vehicles go past the
camera at short intervals The truck carrying Ernie swings
into view Bill Walker and the driver can be seen in the cab
As the van of the truck bounces by the view moves with it a
little way It is nearing sundown and the boys arent quite
as full of fizz and vinegar as they were at high noon and
its hot

Inside the TROOP TRUCK The view favors the Air Guard who is
stolidly chewing gum as he keeps his eye on the sky
Warnicki looks up to him

WARNICKI
Hey how much further we got to go

AIR GUARD
(stolidly)
About twenty miles

The view slowly pulls back to include the others

LOPEZ
How far

AIR GUARD
Twenty miles Then you get out and
walk another ten -- you know to get

the stiffness out of you
SPENCER
(indignantly)

Where we going China

Several sudden dull thud-thuds from the distance interrupt

him Theyre repeated Everyone grows still -- look at each
other
SPENCER
(excitedly)
Hey -- thats ours -- 105s --
AIR GUARD
(laconically)
Theirs -- 88s--

They all grow tense The artillery fires again They all
look off toward the horizon following which there is a
distant view of the HORIZON With the darkening hills
illumined by flashes of artillery fire Then we again see
the group the view favoring the AIR GUARD

WARNICKI
Thought you said twenty miles--

AIR GUARD
Thats what I said -- twenty miles--

Suddenly without warning he pounds the cab-roof with his
rifle butt There is a shriek of brakes and the men are
half-thrown off their feet as the truck stops Whistles and
cries are heard The men are half petrified

Inside the CAB There is a pounding on the roof Walker has
already jumped on the seat and is opening the cab skylight
The driver is hunched over the wheel face down

We get a fairly close view of the TRUCK as an explosion
shakes it The men scramble over its sides and we next see
the HIGHWAY at a low angle with the men jumping forward and
out of sight as other closer explosions shake the earth

A close view of the TRUCK discloses WALKER firing at the
diving but still distant Stuka He is alone utterly
exposed

In a series of flashes we see the various GIs hitting the
dirt Dondaro and Newman Warnicki and Spencer Mew alone
Lopez and Murph Ernie near Gawky who is hugging his dog
close We just get a glimpse of Gawky as he picks up the

dog and runs for the ditch There is the splatter of the
machine gun and the terrifying whine of the Stuka as it
dives closer

WALKER seen closely is firing away at the fast approaching
Stuka As the planes engine swoops down reaching its most
unbearable pitch Walker swings around firing at the plane
His face is gutted hard perspiring The sound of the Stuka
recedes

We see WARNICKI and SPENCER on their knees

SPENCER
(looking bewildered
up at the sky)
I -- I didnt even see him

We see DONDARO getting to his feet Then as he suddenly
realizes hes alive his face lights up with the exhilarated
exultance of survival He laughs a little hysterically and
looks around The view widens as several of the others
gather They look at each other for a moment unable to
speak with joy at having come through their baptism of fire
alive

MURPHY
(excitedly)
Hey -- whatd I tell you guys about
the Air Corps

WARNICKI
They stink

MEW
Look at ‘em scram

DONDARO
The yella bellies

Dondaro stands there giving the Italian elbow business They
all start toward the truck Dondaro turns around looking for
Gawky They all look around and in the expressions on their
faces we know what they see off scene There is a moments
still tableau Lt Walker comes into the scene with the dog

under his arm -- he hands the pooch to Warnicki
WALKER
Okay fellas -- in the truck -- in
the truck
(As they slowly start
climbing in -- softly)

The medics will take care of him
(Harsh again)
Come on get movin get movin

Ernie comes He and Walker exchange looks

WALKER
(quietly)
First deads always the worst

ERNIE
(without conviction)
I suppose so

Walker walks away Ernie looks after him with a deep
understanding We then see the TRUCK as Ernie climbs into it
and it starts off Ernie takes his place between Mew and
Dondaro The men are saddened silent gazing in the
direction of Gawky and we next see GAWKY lying in the
distance against the background of a burning truck anda
lone medic making his way toward the figure on the ground

A little gust of wind is blowing sand toward the body

The scene cuts back to the GROUP on the truck

MEW
(quietly)
Guess he wont never get that letter
from that Gordon dame now

DONDARO
(spitting harshly)
That makes em even She wont get
no more from him neither

Silence -- except for the spaced thud of shells in the
distance Ernie looks around at the men and we see that
they are subdued quiet tense The dusk deepens The burst
of shells comes closer louder Then we get a close view of
ERNIE and DONDARO

ERNIE
(quietly)
What was Gawkys last name

DONDARO
(simply)
Henderson

The scene dissolves to a long view of a DETRUCKING POINT at
gray dawn A steady bone-chilling rain comes down as the
trucks disgorge their men Jumping off from the rear of one
of the trucks into the splashing mud our boys form up into
the lines off scene Walker is standing by the truck
Continued thud of shells throughout -- much closer now
Shivering he takes his place in line Hes followed by Mew
then Warnicki and the pup then Ernie Ernie looks like a
wet cat As he piles off Walker turns to him

WALKER
Well Mr Pyle -- this is the end of
the line Were liable to run into a
little trouble from here on Weve
got a couple of jeeps going back--

ERNIE
(hesitating for a moment
fully aware of the others
waiting for his reply)
Do you mind if I go all the way

WALKER
(after a brief pause)
Well its your funeral--

Ernie falls into line as we hear shouts of All right fall
in and Is this trip necessary

There is a close moving view of the men in files moving up
past the rain drenched trucks as one soldier declares Here
were getting amphibious Dondaro and Warnicki exchange a
glance of jocular respect in Ernies direction The thunder
of the guns momentarily grows louder The mens glances
stray upward Their expressions turn grim as they look --
toward the HILLS which flare up with a spasm of artillery
fire

This dissolves to a picture of GI BOOTS in the RAIN picking
up wads of muck as they slog on through the mud The view
moves up to the bowed heads of Mew and Dondaro The rain
falls with constant steady penetration

DONDARO
(half-looking about)
Hey wheres the little guy

MEW
Pop

DONDARO
What dya mean Pop Ernie

MEW
Ernies a little way back--

They turn and look over their shoulders and we next see --
plugging his way up the incline -- a small drenched figure
falling slowly but steadily behind despite his effort to
keep up The scene then cuts back to DONDARO and MEW
shaking their heads as they plow on

DONDARO
Hes over thirty-eight He dont
need to be here

MEW
Be here He can even go home

But there is a wry respect in their tone The artillery fire
comes closer as they slog on and the scene dissolves to a
long view of the TROOPS marching endlessly in the rain They
are more tired and their tempo is slower now The company
commander is seen in the background

COMPANY COMMANDER
(yelling)
Okay men Fall out and take a break

We see DONDARO MURPHY MEW and ERNIE slump to the ground
exhausted

This cuts to a close view of a GIs HEAD and SHOULDERS
Forked around his neck is heavy machine-gun tripod As he
staggers to the side of the road it is as if he were
undergoing some medieval torture Sweat pours down his
deep-lined unshaven face as he removes the tripod and
wearily sinks in the mud with it

This cuts to a long view of the BOYS They are seated and
lying in various postures of complete exhaustion The same
company commander rises in the foreground as a runner comes
up to him

COMPANY COMMANDER
(in a matter-of-fact tone)
Okay men lets get going
As they all start to rise JOE the eternal soldier meekly
takes up the tripod slings it over his neck pulls himself
up and slogs on

The scene dissolves to a view of the MARCHING TROOPS then
to ERNIE as he drags himself up to a stone on the side of
the road and sits down Hes pooped Despite the cold rain
he takes his helmet off and wipes the perspiration from his
brow He looks over his shoulder and waves the gang on The
angle widens keeping ERNIE in the fore Quite a distance
off now Walkers company is heading up through a defile A
couple of the boys turn and wave back to Ernie before they
disappear around a bend

ERNIE seen closely reaches into his pocket for a cigarette
Wet-fingered he finally gets a cigarette out and then vainly
tries to light a match in the rain After some effort he
gets the precious flame lit and is bringing it up to the
bedraggled cigarette when the water pouring down from his
helmet drenches everything He dashes the limp cigarette to
the ground There is the sound of troops moving off Ernie
turns and in a fairly long view as seen from his angle we
see coming up the narrow road another line of troops
approaching Ernie and going in a direction at right angles
to that taken by Walkers company They too are mud-caked
weary looking but with a certain cockiness about them

They call out jauntily as they pass Ernie -- One of the

men falls slightly out of line

GI
How about getting my name in the
paper Harry Fletcher Ashtabula
Ohio

ERNIE
(grinning)
Sure Whatll I say

The angle widens to include the SOLDIER as he moves on

GI
(yelling back)
Anything just so the folks back
home see my name in the paper

And now another soldier calls out to him

GI
Hey Ernie Tell Cleveland Joe
McCloskey is winning the war --
single-handed

We get a close view of ERNIE as he watches the soldiers
moving on

ERNIES VOICE
Winning the war single-handed -- Joe
McCloskey who mixed sodas in the
corner drugstore and Harry Fletcher
who just hung out his law shingle --
Danny Goodman who checked your oil
in the summer and studied medicine
in the fall and here they are
facing a deadly enemy in a strange
and far away land This is their
baptism of fire -- with chaos -- in
defiance -- Going up the brink of
death in the night time -- puzzled
-- afraid -- each boy faced the
worst moment of his life -- alone
-- It was a battle without let-up
-- and it was going against us

He wipes his face thoughtfully and then gets up to join the
line as the scene fades out

B

The interior of a FARMHOUSE fades in It is dusk The old
battered farmhouse has been converted into a command post
Lieutenant Strobel his face strained to the point beyond
exhaustion is at the phone which has been set up on a box
On the wall behind him is a torn field map Sergeant Fleers
near it Several men lie huddled in sleep in the shadows of
the room Lt Wilson sits slumped on a box Dusk is rapidly
falling and there is a chill and spiritual darkness about
the scene which is sensed more in the weariness of the mens
faces bodies and dust and sweat-clotted uniforms than in
the failing light It is that final weariness which men can
endure while they still move talk when they have to or
even fight again when they must Continuous sound of gun
fire is heard throughout

STROBEL
(half-asleep at the phone)
Two days ago we were doing fine
going to kick the n parade
into parade into

Dozes off without finishing Suddenly he jerks awake and
grabs the phone

STROBEL
(into the phone
automatically)
First Battalion First Battalion

He looks a bit bewildered as he hears no reply -- and hangs up

STROBEL
(smiling wanly)
Keep hearing it all the time
(Then)
Try to reach Walker again See
how hes Strobel to Walker Over
A burst of shell fire blots out his words

From another angle which includes the DOOR we see Ernie as
he enters battered and worn He limps over to Sgt Fleers
who is marking his map with the aid of a flashlight

STROBEL
Shut that door

ERNIE
(wearily)
Sorry How we doin

FLEERS
(after a pause morosely)
Its not so good Got us zeroed

in with artillery on two sides They
can fan a flys tail in mid-flight
if its dumb enough to show

A terrific explosion bursts directly overhead The two men
instinctively dive to the floor -- We see the two men on
the FLOOR as they are about to rise but before they can do
so a second explosion shakes the house Fleers looks over
at Ernie

FLEERS
(a little angrily)
Youre a correspondent What in hell
dya want to get up so close for

Ernie is a little apologetic at his lack of good sense

ERNIE
You got me

They start to rise shakily the angle widening

FLEERS
(spitting)
If I was out there and I wasnt
scared -- Id get scared now

Suddenly theres a burst of gun fire flatter and nearer
than the shell fire

FLEERS
(laconically)
Sending in their heavies

LT WILSON
(limping over)
Lousy Krauts Sneak out fire a few
rounds at our lighter stuff and then
chase back to cover
Fleers glances at the map the view moving in

FLEERS
Only thing between us and them is
Walkers gang

STROBEL
Not many men

FLEERS
(pointing to the
spot on the road)

Yeah -- its a lucky thing them Huns
dont know it -- yet
STROBEL
(into the phone)
First battalion Right
Withdraw Somers position to Hill
362

Fleers does so His new pencil mark makes a definite dent in
the right flank

STROBEL
Strobel to Walker Strobel to Walker
Over Cant seem to reach Walker

The three men exchange silent glances They turn away The
phone rings

STROBEL
(answering it)
First Battalion D company Yes
sir I see No sir Colonel
Hunt hasnt got back yet from his
reconnaissance He

COL HUNTS VOICE
(cutting in)
Who is it Ralph

The angle widens revealing Colonel Hunt standing in the
doorway A PFC closes the door behind him Hunts tired
old-young face lean as shell splinters is rowelled with
exhaustion

STROBEL
Captain Horton sir Reporting four
of his mortars knocked out Hes
pretty badly shot up

All stare at Hunt After a moment he makes his decision

HUNT
Tell him to pull back to Hill 148
and dig in

STROBEL
Right sir
(Over the radio)
D Company Hello D Company
Hello

(His voice frantic)
They dont answer Colonel

COL HUNT
Keep trying
STROBEL
Right sir
Silence -- the significance of Hortons sudden silence sinks

in Hunt stares singly at the men in the room They stare
back at him through the half-light When he comes to Ernie
he pauses

FLEERS
(quietly explaining)
Correspondent Hello
ERNIE
Hi
STROBEL
(still trying to
make contact)
Hello -- hello

Hunt just looks at Ernie and then goes over to the map
swaying slightly from exhaustion as he goes

We see the men grouped around the map the view favoring
HUNT The men have gathered around Hunt He closes his eyes
for a moment and then opens them

HUNT
Both flanks are gone Our centers
weak Were just spread too thin
They threw us in to try to bluff and
hold them The lousy Krauts are
beginning to find out

The men listen the shadows in their exhausted faces
are deepened by the flashlight held under them

HUNT
Theyre pouring more and more
strength through the pass Yeah and
despite all the fairy stories a good
green man cant beat a seasoned
crafty veteran -- especially when the
veterans get thrown together
STROBEL

(quietly)
Bensons through sir -- they knocked
him out when they came through the
pass
HUNT

(his lips pressing

together shrugging)
Well there it is All we got in
front of us is Roberts and Walkers
outfits A little more than a
company Theyre not enough to hold

the Jerries back But if the
infantry sticks it out --
(decisively)

-- we will too

He looks around for any contrary opinions There are none
The men move silently away Lang comes in from the next
room

LANG
Theres some hot coffee and beans on
the fire sir

HUNT
No thanks

FLEERS
I could use some

He looks inquiringly at Hunt Hunt sinks to a box without
replying There is a shell burst close by The men hunch
within themselves The building trembles and subsides

ERNIE
Me too
STROBEL
(trying the phone)
D Company -- hello hello -- They

dont answer Colonel

HUNT
Okay

They follow Lang toward a side doorway following which we
see them flashlight their way down a narrow passageway
toward the kitchen Two more shells burst just overhead The
passageway is too narrow for them to do anything but huddle
against the wall until the trembling building subsides

FLEERS
Hes beginning to split the plate
The view moves with them down a stairway leading to the
kitchen on the ground level Next we see them in the KITCHEN
moving across to the stove and being forced to step across a
young girls legs as they go Then we see the GIRL from
Ernies angle Only a slight trembling of her body and a
tighter gripping of her chair reveal any reaction Her eyes
still remain fixed into space There is the sound of the
door opening

The scene cuts back to the main room of the farmhouse the
officers dugout where COLONEL HUNT is seated in the
foreground The door opens Hunt looks up Walker enters the
room and comes toward him Walkers unshaven face is gaunt
with weariness his uniform gray with caked mud

HUNT
(tensely)
Hows it going Walker

WALKER
(his voice deadly tired)
Oh -- were holding out okay sir
» Our phone went dead Captain
Roberts sent me up to see if there
was any -- any change in plans -- or
-- or what well if there was--

Hunt glances over to Strobel who is listening intently at
the phone Strobel shakes his head

HUNT
(to Walker)
No No change -- yet -- Better

stick around for a while

Walker turns away the scene moving with him as he goes
wearily toward a box Ernie preceded by Lang comes out of
the passageway Ernie and Walker stare at each other for a
moment their eyes expressive of all their thoughts Behind
them in the shadows Fleers and Wilson return to the room
Suddenly as Walker sinks to a box all sound of gun fire
ceases outside

A deadly and ominous silence falls over the room The men
lift their heads straining their eyes their bodies tense

The silence is sharply cut by the jangle of the phone

VOICE OVER RADIO

Day to Hunt Day to Hunt
Over
STROBEL
(who has lifted
the phone)

Hunt to Day Over

VOICE OVER RADIO
Withdraw tank positions -- Zebra 87
Zebra 87 Over and out

Hunts lips tighten Theres a brief pause Then he speaks

HUNT
Fleers -- put all these papers in
the fireplace --

FLEERS

Burn ‘em sir

A wider angle shows everyone tensely watching Hunt waiting
for his decision Hunts face mirrors his brief hope that he
can still hold

HUNT
Not yet

Fleers quickly goes about the business of gathering up the
company documents lying on boxes near Strobel taking them
to a small fireplace at the right Suddenly the sound of
shell fire starts again in the distance And as suddenly the
door bursts open and a worn and bloody soldier staggers into
the room Several flashlights turn on him as the view
swiftly moves in to him It is Warnicki bleeding profusely
from a cheek wound his eyes glazed his tongue thick with
shock

WARNICKI
(panting thickly)
Lieutenant Walker -- Lieutenant
Walker--
WALKER

(who is at is side)
What is it Sergeant

In his shocked state Warnicki doesnt recognize him He
starts moving on

WARNICKI
Lieutenant Walker Got to see
Lieutenant Walker

Walker holds him turns him around The others gather around

WALKER
Here I am Warnicki

WARNICKI
Never saw anything like it Never
saw anything like it in my life

A faint look of recognition flickers in Warnickis dazed
eyes He tries to talk but his tongue is too thick with
shock
WALKER
(soothingly his voice
surprisingly soft)

Take it easy Easy -- boy --

easy
Someone -- Lang -- comes up with a drink Warnicki gulps
it seems to revive -- recognizes Walkers friendly face for

the first time He begins to talk his lips still
stammering

WARNICKI
Th-their heavy t-tanks overran our
position -- p-point blank Point
blank sir had to get out

had to get out Got some of the men
behind the hill Did the best I
could sir did the best I could

The men are seen closely the view favoring HUNT as he
watches Warnickis agonized face and hears his words

HUNT
(decisively)
Fleers burn the papers

An officer at his side starts to protest

HUNT
(a little sharply)
Thisll be the first time I ever
ordered any outfit out of anywhere
I wonder when were going to start
winning this war

He turns to the others the angle widening The flames of
the company papers cast an eerie dancing light over the
scene

HUNT
Strobel notify the company
commanders were pulling out
(Grimly)
Well save what we can for another
day All right men on your feet

STROBEL
Strobel to Day Come in Over

VOICE OVER RADIO
Day to Strobel Over

STROBEL
Scram Scram Over and out

Hunt starts toward the door followed by the various
officers and men the view moving with them to the door

FLEERS
(to Ernie nodding
toward a sleeping man)
Come on hes dead

The view holds on the door as the men hurry limping
grimly into the night The dancing flame of the burning
papers is reflected on the door as the scene fades out

C

A rocky landscape fades in There is a long view of the
countryside as soldiers are winding over a hill and coming
forward Then we see ERNIE seated at a typewriter in the
foreground As he types he is seen drinking coffee from a
flask and soaking his feet in a helmet filled with water

ERNIE
(as he types)
American boys -- beaten -- beaten

badly One of the few times in our
history It was a bitter and
humiliating experience and Joe
McCloskey was wondering what the
folks back home in Cleveland were
thinking of him now -- As we look
back on that first defeat and the
bloody victories that followed we
realize that only battle experience
can make a combat soldier Killing

is a rough business -- men live
rough and talk tough -- Jimmie
OBrien -- 1918 -- State

We see a GI standing near Ernie looking over his shoulder

JIMMIE
Hi Ernie thanks for putting my
name in the paper -- I believe Ill

get a commission--

ERNIE
Selling what
JIMMIE
Me and my buddy -- E-l-b-r-i-g-h-t
ERNIE
That was cute the way he told the
joke
JIMMIE

Best outfit in the whole army

ERNIE
(continuing to type)
On a dull day you can always get a
fight in the Army by arguing which
is the best outfit In a year Ive
been to a lot of places and learned
to love a lot of men One special
place in my heart was with the boys
Id started with Everybody else had
a company and I felt I had one too
-- Company C -- 18th Infantry And I
was wondering about Wingless Murphy
Sergeant Warnicki and Lt Bill
Walker and a funny little mutt named
Ayrab

The scene dissolves showing the BOOTS OF GIS ON A DUSTY
ROAD The boots hard and encrusted look as though theyve
been slogging over three of the five continents and are well
on their way over the next two Tagging along with them
like a lean gray-dusted veteran is Ayrab the company pup
As the swirls of dust rise the view moves up and reveals
Dondaro and Murphy They look tough whiskery hard-shelled
-- and weary as they march on

MURPH
Hey Dondaro What town do we
take today

DONDARO
San Raviolo

MURPH

Didnt we take that one yesterday

DONDARO
Naw that was San Something Elsio

They walk on for a few moments

ERNIES VOICE
(coming over the scene)
Hadnt seen em in a long time --
now I set out to find em Theyd

been through a lot by now -- Conquest
of Sicily -- murderous landings in
Salerno -- hammering down the long

hard road to Rome

We now see a STEEP HILL as our men slog up a few steps
reaching a level spot Walker climbs into view

WALKER
All right men Fall out Chow up

The men flop wearily to the ground

MURPH
(as he stretches out)
You know after this war is over Im
gonna get me a map and find out
where Ive been

Mew nearby glances off and grins He nods across the road
whereupon the view moves slightly to include a windmill
standing in a field It bears the manufacturers sign
Meline Company Illinois

The GIs on the GROUND are startled by a loud but distant
reverberation which shatters the otherwise peaceful scene
Spencer who has been dozing wakes up alarmed As the boys
sink back and relax again we hear the noise of trucks
grinding up the hill immediately followed by a cry of Mail
Call Spencer and the others instantly come awake and run
off in the direction of the cry and we next see them
gathered around the jeep waiting for their mail The jeep is
one of several other supply trucks that are still coming up
and parking As the lucky ones get their letters they go
off by themselves to read them -- As the view moves past
them it stops at the various boys One kisses his letter
surreptitiously another frowns a third Dondaro laughs
aloud As he continues to read the camera moves on past
Lopez whose smile-wreathed face nods Si si si as he
reads then pauses on Mew who seems puzzled as he turns an
official looking paper over

MEW
Hey whats this

SPENCER
(looking over)
Your insurance form Whats the
matter with you -- You forgot to put
in the beneficiarys name

MEW
Whats that

SPENCER
Anybody whose name you put in there
gets the 10000 semoleos

MEW

(a little taken aback
Anybody whose name I put there
gets

SPENCER

(laconically)

Yeah And youd better put it in
before the next shindig bub or
there wont be no dough Stick your
old ladys name down and youre okay

MEW
I aint got no--

SPENCER
(Shortly)
Your old man then
(As Mew shakes his head)
Aint you got no relatives

Mew grins and again shakes his head

SPENCER
(a little impatiently)
Well stick anybodys name down You
dont wanna let all that dough go to
waste

He goes leaving Mew grinning like a potential millionaire
But suddenly a worried look appears on Mews face Whom
shall he put down Here he has all this bounty to dispense
but-- Suddenly his face lights up He starts to put a name
down -- then changes his mind Hes in a quandary He looks
around and suddenly spots Warnicki His face lights up as he
hurries over to him

MEW
(elatedly)
Hey Sarge -- what do you know

Yesterday I aint worth a plugged
nickel today I can throw ten
thousand bucks away just like that

But Warnicki has his own little problems Hes holding a
large flat cardboard package and he doesnt know what to
make of it He keeps turning it over Ayrab keeps leaping
around him thinking the package is something for him

MEW
(suddenly caught by
Warnickis package
inquisitively)
Whatve you got there Somethin to
eat

WARNICKI
I dunno

MEW
Well open it Howre you gonna find
out unless you open it

WARNICKI
Thats an idea

His dirty claw-like hands rip the wrapping off and its
wrapped better than an onion Warnicki finally reaches the
bottom layer revealing -- a phonograph disc He quickly
reads its label and his grizzled pugs face lights up
WARNICKI
Its from the old lady Look what
she done She had the kids voice
put on a record Juniors voice He
couldnt even say ma-ma when I left

MEW
(delighted for him)
Geez Lets listen to it

WARNICKI
Whos got a phonograph around here

MEW
Maybe they got one in the next town

WARNICKI
Yeah What are we waiting for Lets
get going

As he whirls off with no other thought than getting to the
next Italian town as quickly as possible there is a sudden
shriek of brakes near him He almost drops the record -- A
jeep has nearly run Warnicki down Warnicki turns in sudden
murderous anger His expression has swiftly changed Theres
really a killer in his expression

WARNICKI
(starting toward
the jeep humorlessly)
Why dont you look where youre
going you--

We now get a close view of the jeep and its occupants the
driver and Ernie Ernie looking haggard worn combat-—
strained starts to smile but suddenly he becomes anxious
as this murderous looking animal in khaki bears down on him

WARNICKI
(glowering)
Get outa that jeepn Ill beat your
brains out--
(Suddenly he stops)
Hey its Ernie Its the little guy

Ernie relaxes It was a bad moment But he doesnt have a
chance to savor his relief for others have come crowding

up

DONDARO
Its Pyle

Ernie beaming shakes hands on all sides

GIS
(ad libbing)
Seen any dames

Whats been keeping ya

Good to see you Ernie

Been saving sugar for you Ernie
At last I met Ernie Pyle now I can
write the old man and he can relax

BENEDICT
Here we go again Every time you
show up theres a big battle Thats
the way it was in Tunisia You
better check your dog tags boys
You know something -- my old man
says I look like you

ERNIE
Yeah thats me I go around
starting wars A guys gotta make a
living Gotta have something to
write about Good to see you boys
again

At this point Walker appears bringing the expected news

WALKER
On your feet men were pulling
out
ERNIE
(seeing Walker who
is a Captain now)
Hi Bill
WALKER
(warmly)
Hi Ernie
The sergeants voice rings out -- and is echoed down the

line The GIs slouch off obeying the whistle Ernie gets
out of the car and we see him with Walker

ERNIE
(grinning with a glance
at Walkers bars)
Well I see youve been going up in
the world -- congratulations

WALKER

(glancing at

his shoulders)
Oh these Thanks

(with a grim smile)
You know thats because I survived
longer than the other Looeys I
guess Okay Sergeant Move em out

Ernie and Walker start moving down the line as the sergeants
whistle blows again

ERNIE
How are you Wingless Hows the Air
Corps

MURPHY

Fraid the Buddy systems got me

ERNIE
Me too
(Ernie glances off toward
the men grinning to
Walker)
Well you got an outfit now

WALKER
(grimly)
You bet your life were an outfit

Ernie again looks off toward the men and we see from his
and Walkers angle the GIs slogging down the road There
is something about their slouching stride their cold
intent impersonal movements the way they carry their
rifles the slant of their shoulders that characterizes
them sets them apart

ERNIE
They look tough

WALKER
They are tough
(quietly grimly)
Theyre killers

Something in Walkers tone makes Ernie look up He looks
directly ahead The reverberation of heavy shelling comes
from the not too distant right Walker looks off his lips
compressed

WALKER
(grimly)
And theyd better be

Ernie glances up at Walker His face too is grave as the
two slog on and disappear The scene dissolves to a BATTERED
SIGNPOST with GIs marching in the foreground The Signpost
reads

Roma 188 Km
Cassino 19 Km
San Vittorio 3 Km

We see a long view of SAN VITTORIO under heavy artillery
bombardment then a SAN VITTORIO STREET Slam-banging
furiously through the battle-clouded piazza an Anti-Tank
37 swings into action against a shell-spitting pillbox
blocking its way With workmanlike precision the five-man

team blasts shell after shell at the pill-box in the
background a pack of wild dogs run howling through the
street (Throughout the following sequence of street

fighting there is the continuous rat-tat of machine-gun
fire ping of sniper bullets and the blast and boom of
shells)

BEFORE A THEATER A Bazooka team dives through enemy fire to
the protection of some rubble They wham away at a shell-
torn sniper-infested theater As they inch forward the rear
man is hit by machine-gun fire Glancing back only
momentarily the front man carries on alone amid the
machine-gun fire from the theater

A NARROW STREET A tank plows through a narrow street
blasting at the houses on either side Its sides seem to
swell with each shell burst Half-exposed the Tank Guide
blazes away in a circular fire Now coming into the clear
guns ablaze the tank sprints across an avenue nimbly
crunches up the steps of a public building and smashes
through its walls -- and continues on

A SHELL-TORN STREET A squad of GIs whirl around the corner
in the background only to be pinned down by a rain of
machine-gun fire from a rooftop in the foreground They
swiftly dive behind some rubble on the ground One of the
GIs (Murph) in the rear slinks off to the right

A CORNER BUILDING Pressed against the walls Murph comes
around the corner of the building in an almost careless
slouch

We get a close view of MURPH unpinning a grenade He hurls
it with an over-hand motion to the roof-top above him And
waits -- with an almost comically meditative patience There
is a blast above him Smoke and powder billows out of the
smashed window Murph kicks open the door and peers in He
pops out again his mud-caked face split in a grin as he
holds up three fingers

We see ERNIE peering out cautiously from behind some rubble
in the direction of the street fighting Hes evidently
making up his mind to dash across the street Bullets
spatter all about Suddenly theres a lull -- and he chances
it -- As he darts across doubled over several rifle shots
ping at him He reaches a wall from behind which Walker is
covering him firing with cold precision at the sniper

We get a close view of ERNIE and WALKER Ernie is panting
and sweating

ERNIE
When youre in the Infantry --
theres no way to reach a ripe old
age
Several bullets splinter the brick above them Walker
swiftly fires back The enemy is silenced

WALKER
(his eyes glinting)
Im gonna build me a highway to
Berlin over them

The rattle of machine-gun fire cuts his words This is
immediately followed by a cry of Medic Medic

From another angle we see Mew and Spencer hiding behind some
rubble With them is a Medic who has just finished bandaging
a wounded GI The cry of Medic comes over The Medic
exchanges a short swift glance with Mew and grimly crawls
off in the direction of the cry Suddenly Spencer raises his
rifle upward

Next we see Dondaro sweating and breathing hard breaking
into a small cafe where there is a sudden scream He is
about to shoot when he sees a young disheveled frightened
but obviously handsome woman backing away in a corner

DONDARO
(almost to himself
The Promised Land
(Grinning softly)
Hiya babe--

As he approaches she backs away slightly Her look of
fright has disappeared her lips part in a soft sultry
smile They are both breathing hard their eyes fastened to
each other The war outside has vanished has been
forgotten completely -- if anything enhancing and adding
excitement to their meeting

DONDARO
(in Italian softly)
My bones told me all the time you
were waiting right here for me
babe--

AMELIA
(her eyes suddenly
widening with a new
delight in Italian)
You -- Americano-- You speak
beautiful Italian--

DONDARO
(as he moves closer
to her in Italian)
Yes from Brooklyn gift to
Italian womanhood The liaison
officer Your long lost cousin

AMELIA
(delighted with
his Italian)
Bello Bello You speak my language

His hand strays to her hip

DONDARO
(half Italian
half English)
Listen Rainbow even if I was dumb
Id still speak your language Si

Her eyes glance sidelong down at his hand and then back at
him

AMELIA
(softly)
Si

With a throaty little laugh she slips excitingly away from
him to behind the counter He swiftly follows her Suddenly
they look at each other and words are superfluous He grabs
and kisses her fiercely -- pouring all his hunger
loneliness anguish dreams in that kiss She yields
returning his kiss with the same intense hunger As he bends
her back their figures are hidden by the counter The view
holds on the hall -- shattered shelves with broken wine
bottles The beat and throb of the battle outside comes
over

Machine gun fire suddenly rakes the wall sending down a
shower of glass But still they dont come up for air
Suddenly theres a burst of nearby shellfire shaking the
house Dondaro lifts his head dazed He slowly seems to
remember where he is whats going on outside He shivers as
if pulling himself together

DONDARO
(disgusted)
Theres that
(another shell burst)
» war again Sounds like theyre
paging me--

He releases her and hurries toward the spot where he dropped
his rifle Amelia trembling clings to him

AMELIA
(in Italian)
Oh -- no Dont go

DONDARO
(in English
half tempted)
Honest Rainbow this hurts me more
than it does you--
He kisses her again quickly this time -- and picks up his
rifle

DONDARO
(in English)
Ill be back dont worry--

He starts toward the door

AMELIA
(shaking her
head in Italian)
I dont understand what you mean--

DONDARO
(Stopping with a
grin in Italian)
When I get back -- youll understand --
(in English)
-- okay okay --
(He gestures
in Italian)
You wait here Si

She nods with a little laugh

AMELIA
(in broken English)
Okay -- Okay

As Dondaro hurries toward the door he turns Amelia smiles
and nods eagerly Dondaro opens the door The sound of

battle grows louder Grinning he pauses only long enough to
note the number 29 on the door and ducks into the battle-
riddled street

The TOWN SQUARE In the foreground Warnicki Walker and
Rogers grimly move down the rubble-strewn square seeking
out snipers Suddenly Rogers bringing up the rear steps on
a hidden mine Theres a terrific explosion Warnicki and
Walker flatten out

As the shower of rocks and smoke subsides they look back
Rogers has completely disappeared from the face of the earth
Their lips frame soundless curses Grimly they start forward
again only to be suddenly pinned down by a sharp hail of
bullets from the right Swiftly they dive behind some rubble
and peer in the direction of a half-ruined church diagonally
across the street

WALKER
Wheres our platoon

WARNICKI
Up the street

WALKER
Looks like this ones on us

WARNICKI
Okay Ill cover you

The CHURCH BELFRY comes into view and we see a pair of
German snipers firing down at Warnicki and Walker from the
windows following which WARNICKI and WALKER are seen firing
back futilely

WALKER
Lets go to church Warnicki

WARNICKI
Okay Wait a minute

Walker nods and keeps firing as Warnicki quickly unloosens a
smoke-grenade from his belt The two men act in accord as a
team without words Warnicki removes his carefully
blanketed record and lays it in a little cache amidst the
rubble

WARNICKI
(patting it as he
might a child)
You stay there Junior Papall be
right back

He hurls the grenade into the street -- We see the STREET
as it is instantly filled with obscuring smoke Warnicki and
Walker dive into it A frantic spray of bullets from the
church seeks them out -- Through the thinning smoke
Warnicki and Walker uninjured are revealed tensely
flattened against the wall Walker is about to dash into the
church But Warnicki checks him He loosens another grenade
and hurls it through the door Again smoke blots out the
scene again the excited searching spray of tommy-gun fire

Inside the CHURCH Smoke still fills the scene But the
sound of the gunfire is strangely different It echoes and
re-echoes eerily through the cavernous building Suddenly it
ceases The scene is filled with a deathly stillness as the
last echo dies away As the smoke thins we see Warnicki and
Walker hidden behind a pile of rubble They listen tensely
They scarcely dare breathe as they peer about cautiously

There is not a sound not a movement in the half-demolished
church A single fading ray of sunlight shoots down through
the torn roof The rest is in massive shadows The statue of
an angel stands like a ghost in the half-light Before the
altar lies a heap of rubble The stillness is filled with an
awesome terror death may spit instantly from any shadowed
niche or crevice

WALKER
(barely audible)
Pst
(Suddenly he shouts
out a taunting insult)
Lousy Kraut schwein

As the shout echoes and re-echoes against the walls from
somewhere an other shout comes over

SNIPERS VOICE
Americanische Schiese

The shouts and the echoes intermingle in weird and
bewildering reverberations Walker ready to shoot doesnt
The echoes are too bewildering Warnicki grimly realizes
something must be done to get the snipers to disclose their
position Silently he gestures his intent to draw the
Germans fire by dashing across to a pillar toward the
alter As he does so Walker is to cover him Walker nods
Warnicki tensely sets himself

We get a wider angle of the CHURCH with Warnicki and Walker
in the foreground As Warnicki with a cry of Lousy Kraut
Swine exposes himself by swiftly diving across from the
rubble heap to the pillar a shot rings out Shot and cry
reverberate

We see WALKER swiftly firing toward the gallery and then
the GALLERY as a sniper tumbles forward following which

the view widens to disclose Warnicki hidden behind the
pillar indicating hes all right They grin at each other
They are breathing hard with the tension Walker lifts his
fingers indicating That was one but there are two He
gestures its his turn now to try Warnickis trick Warnicki
grins and bows his acquiescence

We get a close moving view of WALKER as he dives with a cry
toward another rubble heap near the altar -- But there is no
revealing shot Warnicki tensed to fire looks puzzled He
looks across at Walker They look troubled let down Where
is that other German Warnicki shouts again But only his
own voice echoes through the church Stillness again A more
ominous stillness

Slowly a rifle barrel appears between the wings of the
STATUE OF THE ANGEL aiming downward -- WARNICKI swiftly
fires at the angel and we see it then toppling with the
sniper Warnicki and Walker rise from their places with
audible sighs of relief

WARNICKI
Its a funny place to be killing men
in isnt it
And on these words Walker goes toward the sniper near the
angel while Warnicki in his simple gratitude picks his

way over the rubble to the altar

Through a narrow break in the debris -- a perfect sightline
for a sniper -- Warnicki can be seen kneeling to cross
himself in devotion A shot rings out -- Simultaneous with
the shot Warnicki bows his head The bullet pierces through
the top of the helmet missing his skull by the fraction of
an inch caused by his bowing

Thereupon the scene tilts upward past Warnicki to the belfry
Warnicki swiftly swings around He fires at a sniper exposed
in the belfry He hits him The sniper staggers and grabs at
the bell-rope to steady himself The bell begins to toll --
slowly with a death-like knell Warnicki and Walker drill
steel at the swaying body until the Germans grasp loosens
and his body plunges downward As he falls his plunge gives
momentum to the swinging bell and its rhythm accelerates
into a joyous triumphant ring echoing and re-echoing
through the church as the scene fades out

D

A WINDOW fades in the sound of the church bell still
ringing over the scene An old wrinkled woman timidly peers
out from behind the battle-scarred shattered window She
looks uncertainly up and down the street Evidently
reassured she sticks a small American flag in a corner of
the window a broad smile wrinkling her face -- Fresh
American troops pour across the PIAZZA Several ambulances
of the Surgical Unit drive by Old Italian villagers with
children and bundles trudge back wearily but happily to
their homes In the foreground -- the engineers have begun
to repair the shattered bridge -- Outside the CITY HALL a
vociferous crowd is angrily milling around the shattered
doorway They drag out a rat-faced civilian from his hiding
place They shower him with blows cursing Fascista Manure
Traittore as he coweringly runs their outraged gauntlet
Several MPs enter the scene and take the Fascist in tow

MP SERGEANT
Okay guys Well handle him from
here on

As the MPs drag him off the villagers still spit and hurl
their curses in the traitors face

We next see a STREET CORNER where GIs are distributing hot
soup and bread from a food truck to a long line of women
children and old men The children gulp their food down
without chewing as if they had never eaten before Grins
gradually suffuse their faces as the hot food begins to
take effect One little girl looks up at the ladling GI
Cries of Viva Americano Viva Americano are heard

A STREET INTERSECTION comes into view A double file of
German prisoners guarded by GIs come down a side street
Some are still a surly arrogant-looking lot Others are
beaten to a point of cretinism A couple of Signal Corps
cameramen run up and take pictures of them -- The view
swings sharply toward a side street where several returned
villagers are poring over the rubble in the middle of the
street -- A MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE stands forlornly looking at
the wreckage of a shop The man holds a child in his arms
beside the woman stands a little ragged girl -- obviously
their children There is a black armband around the mans
sleeve -- Tears fill their eyes as they view the wreckage
of their lifes work He looks up at the ruined building
They all follow his gaze and we see American flags

appearing in many windows -- Smiling through their tears
the little group enters their wrecked shop and starts to
straighten it up -- Then we see ANOTHER STREET as the fresh

GIs march down a bunch of children tagging after them
brashly importuning

CHILDREN
Americano cigarette Gimme

One a ragged boy in a GI barracks bag with name serial
number etc imprinted across the seat is particularly
persistent

BOY
Gimme Americano cigarette Gimme

GI
Cigarettes are no good for children
-- go away -- go away

BOY
(pleading)
Gimme Gimme Me Americano

GI
Sure Your names GI Joe aint it

BOY
Si Si Me GI Joe
(As the GI laughs)
Cigarette Cigarette

GI
(reaching into
his pocket)
Cigarettes no bono for kids

He throws the child a small package and the boy expertly
catches it Its a bar of chocolate The boy bites into it
and grins Then he runs after the GI and in the distance we
see him take the GIs hand and go off skipping as the scene
dissolves to the OUTSKIRTS of the TOWN Lying around in
various stages of exhaustion on both sides of a tree-lined
road are our GIs Dondaro has taken off a mud-caked shoe
and is examining his arch Nearby Ernie is washing an extra
pair of socks in his tin helmet Warnicki is lying back on
his equipment staring at the sky a wisp of grass between
his teeth Ayrab at his feet Mew keeps polishing his rifle
Murph is yawning -- Dondaro lets out a groan
DONDARO
If this war dont kill me first my
feet will

WARNICKI
(with a jaw-cracking yawn)

Me I feel like forty-five

Ernie wrings out his hose

ERNIE
I feel like I was too And I damn
near am

MEW

How old are you

ERNIE
Forty-three

DONDARO
Im twenty-six If I knew Id live
to be forty-three I wouldnt have a
worry in the world

ERNIE
Oh yes you would
(He empties his helmet)
Youd be just like me Worrying
whether youd ever get to be
forty-four

Spencer comes into the scene

SPENCER
Hey guys -- we got twelve hours
rest until they rebuild that
bridge--

DONDARO
(leaping up as a bright
idea suddenly strikes him)
Stop pooch

ROSS
Wheres that whizz bang going

ERNIE
I know Im going to get some sleep

Dondaro hops around on one foot trying to get his shoe on
and laced in a hurry Warnicki has a bright idea of his own
He reaches under his equipment for Juniors blanketed record
Murph just relaxes

SPENCER
(swinging into the scene)
Hey Murph -- hey Murphy That red-
headed nurse of yours is in town --
you know your fiancee

MURPH
Is she
ROSS
What a lucky guy you are -- meeting

a girl youre engaged to in the
States way over here

MURPH
(sitting up
leaden-eyed)
Hey did you hear that My ever
lovin is coming to town

But it still takes a moment before this news penetrates his
sleep-befogged mind

The scene then dissolves to a full view of a PORTABLE
DELOUSING UNIT The delousing mechanisms are at both ends of
four showers The men feed their combat clothes in at one
end stand in line for their showers and emerge cleansed at
the other end to receive their deloused clothing A QM

Sergeant -- snappily uniformed clean shaven wearing horn-
rimmed glasses -- directs the operations
SERGEANT
(Officiously)
Okay men your three minutes are up
now -- move out of there -- come on

get out of there
(He is greeted
with ad libs)
Snap it up men Two minutes to
lather -- one to rinse We havent
got all day
(Barking at a bather)
What do you think this is -- a
bubble-bath

Mew and another GI both bearded dirty exhausted stop
before the Sergeant and stare at his fruit salad his
ribbons

MEW
(innocently)
Hey Sarge whats all that

SERGEANT
This

MEW
Yeah yeah
SERGEANT
(Proudly pedantically)
Well the yellow one is for National
Defense the red and white is for
very good conduct and the real
pretty one with all the colors is
for being in this theatre of

operations
MEW
(in amazement)
No kidding
GI
(innocently)
Yeah Know any good war stories
Sarge
SERGEANT
Yeah as a matter of fact--
(Laughing)
Oh come on your three minutes are
up

SPENCER and LOPEZ naked are waiting in line to shower

SPENCER
(looking toward
the showers)
Hey look at Murph -- Hes falling
to sleep on his feet

He pushes toward Murph whom we then see under the shower
Bearded hollow-eyed he desperately tries to keep his eyes
open as he lathers Spencer comes up to him and pokes him

SPENCER
(troubled)
Hey Murph come on This is your
big day
MURPH

(heroically between
globs of water)
Okay If Red wants to go through
with it Im game

He almost falls asleep there and then Spencer shakes him as
the scene dissolves out

AMELIAS STREET dissolves in as Dondaro comes tearing down
to DOOR No 29 and as he disappears through the door it
slams closed -- This dissolves to ANOTHER STREET where
Warnicki holding his blanketed record comes up to a group
of Italians Ayrab is with him
WARNICKI

Hey Know where I can finda
phonograph

(The group doesnt

seem to understand)
A phonograph -- a victrola -- a
music box see Whats the matter
You cant understand plain English

Heart-broken in their eagerness to be helpful the Italians
volubly canvass each other Warnicki watches hopefully

We get a close view of AYRAB looking up a little ashamed of
his master for even deigning to listen to this jabber Then
we see the CROWD again No luck none understood Warnickis
face neons

WARNICKI
Look -- A phonograph a victrola a
music box

He motions as if winding a machine A light dawns on one of
the women

WOMAN
(in a rising scale)
Oh Oh OH

She also makes a winding motion Warnicki nods The woman
hurries into her ruined house

WARNICKI
(elated)
Shes got one Ayrab Were gonna
get to hear Junior yet

The Italians are delighted Jabbering they assure Warnicki
shes a smart woman a fine woman a brilliant woman Shell
find it And there she comes with an old-fashioned coffee-
grinder The Italians look eagerly at Warnicki -- and are
crestfallen at his look of disgust

WARNICKI
No No NO
(Another idea hits him)
Look--
(He stars singing)
Oh Marie Oh Marie Did-da-da-tum
ti-da-dum -ti-da-dum--

Again the Italians brighten Eager to oblige their liberator
they sing too

ITALIANS
Oh Marie -- Oh Marie--

WARNICKI
(with abysmal disgust)
Aw nuts

He continues down the street Ayrab after him The Italians
helplessly twirl their fingers at their temples as the scene
dissolves out

A half blown out BUILDING dissolves in the view moving up
along the shattered building past one demolished floor
then another and then a third holding on Warnicki in the
bomb-shattered flat where he has finally unearthed a
battered old portable victrola

WARNICKI with an intense happy gleam examines the
battered phonograph trying to make it go He presses the
lever Nothing happens He spins the plate with his finger
But all he can get is a grinding noise Warnicki listens

WARNICKI
Little rusty--
(The scene widens to
include Ayrab cocking
his ear)
Ayrab youre gonna hear Junior or
else

Hastily he searches through his pockets for a knife as the
scene dissolves

The scene dissolves to a close view of MURPH soaping up his
two-week beard before a mirror propped against his helmet
His eyelids still weigh a ton As he starts a jaw-breaking
yawn the view expands disclosing a half-ruined cottage
Mew Spencer and Lopez are with Murph Lopez is practicing a
wedding march Murph yawns again

SPENCER
Hey cut that out You cant let Red
down now

MEW
If you do the best manll take over

MURPH
(shaking his head)
Im afraid Ill fall asleep and cut
my fool head off with this Eytalian
razor

SPENCER
So what If we cant marry you
well bury you

He signals Lopez to go on with the music

LOPEZ also yawning starts to play the wedding march
again when suddenly theres a metallic crash
LOPEZ
Ay dime Look at that

And we see that Murph has collapsed over the table

SPENCER
Hes folded Gimme that razor I
done a little barbering in my time
The whole town must have shaved with
this thing

Mew hands Murphs razor to Spencer Spencer pulls back
Murphs head with a professional flourish and starts to
shave him A soldier Jacob comes running in while this
goes on

JACOB
Everythings fixed to the Queens
taste

SPENCER

(as he shaves)
Get Ernie Hes gonna give the bride

away

MEW
Yeah Well get this wedding in the
papers

Mew starts toward the door

LOPEZ VOICE
Get the Captain too Hes an okay
Joe

As Mew and Trenton hurry out the scene dissolves to a view
of the BATTERED PHONOGRAPH The plate whirls about merrily

WARNICKIS VOICE
(elated)
It works What did I tell you It
works

The scene expands and we see that Warnickis sweaty face is
lit with joy Ayrabs head follows the revolving plate
suspiciously Treasuringly Warnicki unwraps the record
places it carefully on the plate and cranks up the motor
But as hes about to lower the arm he discovers that it
lacks a needle

WARNICKI
(dismayed)
No needle

Frantically he searches around the box No needle He looks
around the apartment sees a broken-down dresser He rushes
to it in almost a frenzy of excitement and searches through
the drawers for a needle

The scene dissolves to a BARN Sleeping comfortably on a
pile of hay is Ernie His snores come regular and sweet
Mew hurries in and tries to awaken him

MEW
Ernie--
ERNIE
(rousing himself
Ugh

MEW
Wake up We need you Red wants you
to give her away

ERNIE
(too sleepy to know
what hes talking about)
What I wanna give her away for I
like Red

He turns over and goes back to sleep

MEW
(shaking him)
Hey dont go back to sleep

ERNIE
(slurring)
Oh leave me alone The only way
youll get me out of here is to
carry me out

MEW
We figured on that too

He looks off and gives a sharp whistle The angle widens as
Jacob and another GI carrying a stretcher come up to
Ernie They roll our very sleepy and very astonished
correspondent on to it and haul him away

This dissolves to a SHATTERED APARTMENT where in the
fading daylight Warnicki is breaking off the tip of a
safety pin which he has found As he bends it forward and
backward his bearded face gleams with sweat and excitement
Suddenly the pin snaps off needle size Feverishly he puts
the needle in place almost fumbling it in his anxiety He
picks up the record kisses it and breathlessly replaces it

WARNICKI
(in a whisper
of excitement)
Here goes Ay-rab-- Juniors goin
to talk to his papa
He presses the lever The record whirls around Gently
perspiration tipping his nose he places the needle on the

record -- and the sweetest voice in the world goes
backward--
VICTROLA
(screeching)

A-gul-ub A-gul-ub A-gul-ub

Ayrab jumps back barking indignantly Warnickis face is a
study in dismay and disappointment Hastily he shuts the
phonograph off

WARNICKI
(almost apologetically
to Ayrab)
Backwards Im a son-of-a-

Suddenly theres a sharp whistle from down below

SPENCERS VOICE
Hey Warnicki--

Warnicki looks down and from his angle we look down below
across the street The wedding procession is nearing the
ruined church Twilight is fast falling

SPENCER
(calling up)
Come on Warnicki Murphs getting
married
WARNICKI

(hastily gathering up
the phonograph and record)
Ill fix it later Come on--

He hurries over to the stairs and starts down Ayrab with
him the scene cutting to the CHURCH Led by Lopez and
Spencer playing the Wedding March the procession moves
slowly toward the altar and the Army Chaplain Red is on
Ernies arm Murph best-manned by Mew waits for them
beside a rubble heap at the altar Walker is in the
procession Various GIs bring up the rear As they reach
the altar the music stops and they form before the Chaplain
who is now seen close he is wearing a stole over his
uniform

CHAPLAIN
Dearly beloved we are gathered
here

MURPH and RED are seen close Murph has court plaster
patches over his face He valiantly tries to keep his eyes
open Reds eyes are shining
CHAPLAINS VOICE
in the sight of God and this
company

Now Warnicki appears at the church door He almost stumbles
over the threshold

WARNICKI
(cautioning Ayrab)
Sh Sh

As he clumsily tiptoes to the outer fringe of the wedding
party we hear the Chaplains voice continuing

CHAPLAINS VOICE
» to join together this man and
this woman in holy matrimony

Twilight is now turning to night as the scene cuts to the
Chaplain and to some GIs with Ernie among them

CHAPLAIN
Who giveth this woman to be married
to this man

No one moves Several eyes turn on Ernie who is then seen
close Ernies eyes and thought are far away After a pause
the Chaplain repeats

CHAPLAINS VOICE
Who giveth this woman to be married
to this man

Ernie comes to himself and steps forward as the angle widens
A little sheepishly he takes Reds hand

ERNIE
I do

Red presses his hand and smiles at him as embarrassed he
returns to his place

CHAPLAIN
(to Murph)
Repeat after me -- I Robert Murphy
take thee Elizabeth to be my
wedded wife to have and to hold
from this day forward

Murph repeats each phrase after the Chaplain

We get a close shot of Mew He is beaming Suddenly he gets
an idea He looks secretively about him withdraws his
insurance blank and with a stubby pencil writes some figures

on it as the Chaplains voice comes over Murph repeating

CHAPLAINS VOICE
for better for worse for
richer for poorer In sickness
and in health

We see the INSURANCE BLANK It is marked Beneficiary --
Warnicki -- 2000 Junior -- 2000 And now Mews stubby
pencil adds -- Mrs Murphy -- 2000

RED and MURPH are seen close as the Chaplain continues

CHAPLAINS VOICE
» to love and to cherish till
death us do part

It is night now outside and German DIVE BOMBERS appear in
the sky

We see the CHAPLAIN in the foreground in the church as he
continues with the wedding ceremony

CHAPLAIN
Those whom God hath joined together --
(Rushing the ceremony as
the sound of the dive
bombers increases and the
bombers go into action)
let no man put asunder HIT
THE DIRT

He throws himself flat The whole party follows suit The
shell explodes with a bang beyond the ruined walls Warnicki
in the background covers the phonograph and record with his
body

We see RED and MURPH on the ground

MURPH
(half-covering Reds body)
Take a better man than that to put
us asunder

They kiss and the scene dissolves to a moving view of the
newlyweds as accompanied by the musicians and their
escorts they reach the edge of a road

MEW
(suddenly yelling out)
Procession -- halt Okay kids

Its yours

Grinning he points off to the right and the view moves past
a ruined wall and holds on a wrecked ambulance with a sign
planted beside it Bridal Suite Where once the doors were
blankets have been tacked and looped back with GI neckties
A horseshoe is suspended over the entrance a battered field
telephone at one side is marked Room Service Red and
Murph enter the scene laughing and breathless
RED
(looking back)
Boys -- honestly thanks

And Murph sweeps up Red and carries her over the threshold
-- This cuts to the WEDDING PARTY the faces displaying
varied emotions as they stare across at the married pair

Next in the AMBULANCE Murph removes the neckties and the
blankets drop over the entrance The blankets are chalked
with huge letters DO NOT DISTURB

This cuts to the WEDDING PARTY outside The men havent
moved they stand and stare

WARNICKI
(finally gruffly)
Awright What are you guys
looking at Lets get going

They start to leave Lopez however sits down with his
guitar deliberately turning his back to the ambulance

LOPEZ

(singing as he strums)
Tu eres Lupita divina
Como los rayos del sol--

As Lopez singing comes over the GIs move away one by
one their thoughts far away They are joined by
superimposed images of their beloved ones Warnicki holding
Junior in his arms with Mollie by his side Ernie with That
Girl Spencer with his mother etc Then as they recede
down the night-shadowed road the superimposed figures have
vanished The men are alone forlorn

LOPEZ VOICE
Tu es la flor nicaragua
En la morada de amore

We see AYRAB near the AMBULANCE He has remained behind He
cocks his head curiously up toward the ambulance Lopez
singing continues

Inside the AMBULANCE Murph has collapsed and is fast asleep
Tenderly Red bends down and kisses him as she tucks the
blanket over him Lopez song can be heard from outside

The view looks toward snow-capped CASSINO Flashes of
artillery burst on the horizon

LOPEZ VOICE
Recibe se esta cancion
Tu eres Lupita divina
Como los rayos del sol
His voice fades away And now only the low rumble of distant
gunfire is heard as the scene fades out

E

The ROAD LEADING from the city fades in at dawn The GIs
led by Walker and Ernie are slogging on again in the gray
dawn The view moves past several GIs to Warnicki and Mew
then to Murph gloomily thinking of the brilliant figure he
cut on his honeymoon then to Dondaro tearing up the road
double quick Beyond him lies the town of San Vittorio
Reaching the line he sneaks in furtively between Spencer and
Murph -- He looks wonderfully relaxed in sharp contrast to
the others Suddenly he is attracted to something on Murphs
back which we see from DONDAROS VIEWPOINT Some company wag
has chalked on it JUST MARRIED -- DONDARO grins Spencer
leans over

SPENCER
Hey
(Seeing Dondaros
beaming face)
Oh oh

(Then ironically)
Tell me Dondaro whats your power
over women

DONDARO

(glibly giving

his recipe)
K1lk K1k

(Looking around

grinning)
Whatsamatter with you guys you all
look tired

Murphs doleful face looks over at Dondaro Their faces are
a perfect study in contrast Dondaro grins

DONDARO
(cheerily)
Good morning dear

As Murph starts to curse the scene dissolves to a moving
view of a ROAD favoring WALKER and ERNIE The GIs spirits
have risen with the sun Walker however has a troubled
look on his face as he looks ahead

WALKER
I dont like it -- too quiet

ERNIE
Maybe theyve pulled back all the
way to Rome--

WALKER
(shaking his
head doubtfully)
Uh uh--

From another ANGLE we see several GIs having met no
opposition they are feeling pretty chipper

SPENCER
A walk-away -- a walk-away--
LOPEZ
At this rate well be in Rome in
three days
SPENCER

(with a sly dig)
Maybe Dondaro will give us a knock-
down to some of his cousins -- K1k
Klk

As they turn a bend in the road Dondaro suddenly spots
someone up ahead This dissolves to a ROCKY HILLSIDE at
dusk Tense cautious wary of attack our company spreads
out to occupy the hill slope The men watchfully work their
way toward the crest on which stands an old stone farmhouse
It is a rocky defile Somewhere beyond that gap is the
enemy

We see the crest of the HILL the STONE HOUSE in the
background Crawling up to the crest are Walker and Ernie
Walker looks through his binoculars

WALKER
Look at that old monastery So
peaceful --
(Handing the
glasses to Ernie)
Youd never think

The scene cuts to the MONASTERY and MOUNTAINS Atop Mt
Cassino the Monastery dominates the entire countryside --
aloof brooding eternal

WALKER
there was a war within a
thousand miles of it

ERNIES VOICE
Or a thousand years

Ernie hands the glasses back

WALKER
Well maybe youre right about the
Krauts pulling back to Rome I dont
get it though--
(Shaking his head)
If they want to slug it out here
they can make it plenty tough

At this the scream of several shells splits the air Ernie
and Walker hit the dirt and start scrambling down the
slope

As the GIs scramble behind rocks for cover shell after
shell bursts on the hillside The stonehouse is struck

We get a view of a SHELL CRATER as Ernie tumbles into it and
cowers from repeated explosions

We next see a shallow FOXHOLE with FIELD PHONE and ROCKS
Walkers runner ducks behind the rocks as Walker scrambles
into the foxhole and grabs the phone

WALKER
(into the phone)
Get me Artillery Fire Control
(He ducks as
debris falls)
Pete Walker Yknow that building
on top of the mountain

In a close view of an AMERICAN OBSERVATION POST we see LT
PETERSON at the phone

PETE
ooking off)
The monastery

WALKER

(at the phone)

Call it that if you want to but I
call it in military terms an
observation post If you dont want
to get us all killed you had better
give it the works

We get a close view of WALKER at the phone

PETES VOICE
Cant Got an order about it
Religious shrine

WALKER
(angrily asa
shell screams over)
Does that sound like religion to
you

He reaches up and places the telephone on the parapet of the
foxhole -- This cuts to a close view of PETERSON as the
explosions nearly wreck his phone He grimaces

We again see the HILLSIDE with the MONASTERY and MOUNTAINS
in the background A piercing cry of Medic Medic rises
as more shells scream over In the distance the monastery
stands like a symbol of eternal tranquillity -- ostensibly
beyond reach of violence The scene dissolves to a HILLSIDE
at twilight in the rain The men are wearily digging their
foxholes deeper making use of the terrain for added
protection In the foreground Ernie is watching a patrol
led by Warnicki slog past the shattered stonehouse with
its little shrine as the scene dissolves to a full view
shooting toward a DEFILE at NIGHT in the RAIN Lit by
flashes of distant artillery the remnants of the patrol
straggle back They are drunk with exhaustion and foul
beyond recognition As they pass the view moves to Ernie
watching

WARNICKI
All right men -- lets go
(to Ernie)
Lost three

The scene dissolves to an outcrop of SHELF ROCK in a fog
Ernie and Mew are widening the entrance to a dugout under
the slanting shelf of rock Ernie straightens wearily -- and
bangs his head against the rocky ceiling

ERNIE
Guess it could be deeper

MEW
Yeah kind of looks like well need
a permanent home here

ERNIE
Yeah

He looks off and from Ernies angle we see the MONASTERY
and MOUNTAINS still standing aloof and imperturbable

Into the scene heading toward the defile comes a sizeable
patrol again led by Warnicki

SPENCER
(shaking his head)
Patrol patrol patrol one more
patrol and Ill go nuts

DONDARO
Personally Id feel a lot healthier
if that monastery wasnt lookin
down my throat

They head into the defile and the scene dissolves to a view
of the DEFILE as Ayrab comes romping gaily out of the defile
his tail up like a flag -- his friends are back In direct
contrast to Ayrab come the men great leaden hunks of
exhaustion Several heads stick out of the dugouts and
silently watch them returning The men separate and head for
their foxholes Warnicki heads for Walkers dugout

WALKERS DUGOUT Lit by a candle the dugout is dank wet
dreary just big enough for three people Gas cans serve as
furniture With Walker is Lieutenant Henry Walker haggard
and grimy looks up as Warnicki enters

WARNICKI

(with flat weariness)
Just got back Captain Drew lot
of small arms fire on Hill 457
Mortar fire 793 Terrific
artillery fire but couldnt locate
it

(After a slight pause)
They got Lt Josephs Spencer and
Trenton Michaelson got it in the
arm but I got him back okay

Theres a moments pause then Walker speaks quietly
WALKER
Okay Steve Better get some

chow

Warnicki turns and wearily goes out Walker turns to his
papers

WALKER
You take over Josephs platoon

HENRY
(starting to leave)
Right sir
WALKER
And oh--

Henry half turns Walker speaks without looking at him

WALKER
If Lieutenant Josephs had any
personal stuff send em over
will you

Henry nods and goes For a moment Walker stares before him
then shakes himself and concentrates on his maps A shell
whines over Walker stiffens

Inside WARNICKIS DUGOUT as Warnicki enters and slumps down
to a flat rock This dugout is under a slanting rock which
seems to crush down oppressively on the mens heads They
sit around huddled in their great coats mud-caked begrimed
exhausted The only decoration is a picture of Murphs wife
Red Mew is heating coffee over a fitful fire Murph his
big knees under his chin is huddled in a corner sipping
coffee Dondaro is lying on his back staring up at the rock
Theres the constant sound of enemy shells slugging over
Slow drops of water keep dripping on Dondaros face

DONDARO
Somebody ought to phone the plumber

But he doesnt move

MURPH
You know it sounds pretty silly
when you say it but sometimes
resting like this I get a kick out
of just breathing

MEW
(offering Warnicki a cup)
Hot java Steve--

WARNICKI
No

Warnicki shakes his head picks up his battered victrola and
spins the platter It emits some outlandish sounds Suddenly
theres a swift succession of shell bursts nearby The
entire hillside trembles Fragments of rock fall No one
stirs

MURPH
(exasperated)
Between the monastery and Steves
phonograph
WARNICKI
(grimly)
Ill fix em both before Im
through

Two more shells slug the hillside

MURPH
(bitterly)
There goes that monastery again
Everybody knows its an Observation
Post Why dont they bomb it

Theres an unspoken answer The men look away and in a view
favoring LOPEZ we see him looking from one to the other

LOPEZ
(quietly)
Im a Catholic and I say bomb it
to hell

DONDARO
Check brother

LOPEZ
I got a wife and a kid Think I want
to die for a piece of stone

DONDARO
(sighing)
Why wasnt I born a 4-F instead of
good-looking

Which reminds him Secretively he pulls a small phial from
his pocket and passes it under his nose His eyes melt with
memories and longing Offscene Warnickis record emits some
outlandish sound

The scene dissolves to a HILLSIDE Led by a Lieutenant a
squad of replacements trudge up the mule trail coming to a
halt before Walkers dugout The Lieutenant heads toward it
-- He enters and salutes

LIEUTENANT
Lieutenant Hawkins reporting sir
-- replacements

WALKER
(after a pause)
Yeah Ill be right with you

Hawkins goes Walker takes another sip of coffee obviously
stalling against a job he hates Finally he buttons his coat
and goes Ernie follows

ERNIE
Maidll clean it up later

This cuts to the HILLSIDE Approaching the squad Walker
looks over the new men They are all young Some look eager
some look scared but all look young Warnicki comes up

WALKER
Okay Sarge you line the men up

SERGEANT
All right men fall in

WALKER

(his voice unnecessarily

harsh)
You first four -- First Platoon --
Sergeant Warnickill show you to
your hotel suites

(As the four men fall

out and go with Warnicki
Next six -- Second Platoon -- The
corporal will take care of you The
rest of you go with Lt Hawkins--

(Turning to Hawkins)
Youll replace Lt Henry -- Third
Platoon Turn right past the
mansion and down the hill and turn
to the left All right take over
The men start off

This cuts to WARNICKI and his REPLACEMENTS trudging through
the mud

WARNICKI
Any of you dogfaces know anything
about a phonograph

As the men merely exchange puzzled glances he is disgusted

WARNICKI
The cream of the crop I always get

Theres the scream of shells Everyone dives as geysers of
mud and rock cascade and we get a close view of one of the
soldiers looking out bewildered from a boulder

GI
Gee -- a guy could get killed here --

The scene dissolves to the GROUP on the hillside Tensely
three Lieutenants wait with Walker for some signal

WALKER
All right Lets synchronize our
watches
(to Hawkins)
You stick with Sergeant Warnicki
Lieutenant He knows the terrain
Okay move out

We see a flash of an AMERICAN BATTERY abruptly firing a
terrific barrage of shells then the HILLSIDE Led by their
Lieutenants Warnicki and the GIs start through the defile
Ernie holding Ayrab in his arms grimly watches them

MURPHY
So long Ayrab

ERNIE
(murmuring)
Good luck

His face is blue with cold as the raw wind rips across The
thunder and scream of shells mount Its begun to rain
Ayrab whines softly and snuggles against Ernie He pats the
pup and continues to stare out bleakly The rain falls as
the scene fades out

F

WARNICKIS DUGOUT fades in Ernie is sitting alone Ayrab
lies disconsolately at his feet Theres a fire going
coffee bubbling Suddenly Ayrab leaps up and dashes madly
out Ernie looks up hopefully And now he sees the returning
soldiers As the men return and flop down in their corners
-- one by one -- sodden masses of mud and exhaustion Ernie
silently counts them Theres Lopez And then Mew Pause
And that new kid Whitey A longer pause which seems like
eternity And Dondaro Again a long pause Ernies gaze
falters and then theres Ayrab and Warnicki And thats
all Ernie watches for Murphy But thats all

WARNICKI
My poor aching back

ERNIE looks at the corner where Murphy always sat Then at
Reds picture Then at Mew who slowly takes out his
tattered insurance paper and a pencil and starts to rub
something out following which we see the INSURANCE PAPER
Crossing out Murphs name Mew changes the sum opposite Mrs
Murphys name to 4000 The list now reads Warnicki 2000
Junior 2000 Mrs Murphy 4000

Deeply moved Ernie who has watched this rises takes
Murphs wifes picture off the wall and goes out of the
dugout We then see Ernie coming out and Walker standing at
the the entrance of the dugout watching him disappear over
the hill ERNIE is then seen trudging along looking down at
the ground still stunned by the news with hunched
shoulders and a frozen face

This cuts to the CORRESPONDENTS HEADQUARTERS as Ernie nears
the shack Prominent over the entrance is a sign that reads
NEWSPAPER ROW Directly below these words is the legend

DONT LOOK NOW -- BUT THROUGH
THESE PORTALS PASS THE WORLDS
MOST BEAUTIFUL
WAR CORRESPONDENTS

Ernie still walking slowly enters the scene and goes into
the building

Inside the CORRESPONDENTS HEADQUARTERS there are three

correspondents -- Roberts Landry and Ruben Ruben is
hunched over his typewriter As Ernie enters the room the
correspondents look up -- then quickly stand up and make a

deep salaam to Ernie

CORRESPONDENTS
(in unison)
Our hero Our hero Our hero

ERNIE
Whats the gag

ROBERTS
(subserviently)
Your mail Mr Pyle--
He throws Ernie a crumpled cablegram

ERNIE
Thanks See you already opened it

LANDRY
Why not It was marked Personal

ERNIE
(smoothing out
the cablegram)
Whats in it

RUBEN
Oh nothing much Youve just won
the Pulitzer Prize thats all

ERNIE
Well Ill be darned

Reading the cablegram with a blank expression He is still
stunned by Murphys death

ROBERTS
I regret to inform you Mr Pyle --
you are no longer a newspaperman
you are now a distinguished
journalist--

Landry Ruben and Roberts turn their backs on Ernie The
view moves with Ernie as he walks toward his desk Over the
scene we hear Rubens voice

RUBENS VOICE
Poor devil will probably be famous
now

LANDRY
(sympathetically)
Tsk-tsk-tsk

Ernie makes his way toward his desk slowly still numb He
sits down at his typewriter Slowly he puts the telegram
down and mechanically rolls a sheet of paper into the
typewriter He stares at it for a moment then begins to
type

Looking past ERNIES SHOULDER we see slowly emerging on the
sheet of paper the words I had long ago come to think of
Private Wingless Murphy as an old old friend He was just a
plain Hoosier boy The typewriter moves back and forth
Now you couldnt imagine him ever killing anybody

Ernies eyes fill with emotion his fingers are poised for

typing but nothing comes out He shakes his head reaches

for a bottle of liquor in his desk takes a swallow blinks
and then begins typing furiously as the scene fades out
G

The HILLSIDE the MONASTERY in the background fades in The
stone house is now only a rubble the shrine cracked It is
raining In the distance the monastery is dimly seen through
the mist This cuts to WARNICKIS DUGOUT The first thing
noted is the sound of a radio in this dank dreary hole
Its a portable and the boys huddled in everything they
own are gathered around it The men are listening to the
radio

ANNOUNCERS VOICE
» it will be a comfort to you to
know that your sons wherever they
are at sea or in the sky or in
their foxholes Yes sir your
boys are celebrating too with
the finest turkey cranberry
sauce and all the fixins

And then the radio starts playing Im Dreaming of a White
Christmas

DONDARO
(tapping his ration can
out of which he is eating)
Tough skin on this bird

WAYNE
(digging at some beans)
I always like to eat the stuffing
first

GROSS
(to an imaginary waiter)
Cranberry sauce Mm mm

DONDARO
Poor folks back home Sure got it
rugged

WARNICKI
(at his vic trying
to play it morosely)
Shoulda got a phonograph

This dissolves to a battle-scarred street at dusk as Ernie
walking hunched through the snow-filled muddy street sees
something that attracts his attention Then we see the
QUARTERMASTERS BUILDING from Ernies viewpoint Through the
office window Walker can be seen furiously pounding the
desk of a startled QMC Lieutenant

WALKER
You had turkey The other outfits
had turkey The general had turkey
My men are going to have turkey

LIEUTENANT
(spluttering)
But we did try to

WALKER
Trying aint good enough
(Suddenly very quietly)
You either get those turkeys or the
Supply Corp is going to have to get
themselves a new Lieutenant

His hand slowly moves toward his holster -- And by God he
means it He is holding his gun in a menacing attitude
Ernie unnoticed by either has entered the scene

LIEUTENANT
(nervously)
Ill scrounge around and see what I
can do s-sir

He starts

ERNIE
(innocently)
How about cranberries and stuff

LIEUTENANT
(turning back
exasperated)
Oh now -- wait a minute--

WALKER
(after a swift glance
at Ernie coldly)
Cranberries

LIEUTENANT
Cranberries

The Lieutenant nods and goes Walker turns heartily to Ernie

We next see the men on the HILLSIDE as jouncing along laden
with provisions Ernie and Walkers jeep pulls to a stop
before Walkers dugout As the two men hop out and start to
unload Warnicki approaches

WARNICKI
Phone for you sir Battalion
Headquarters

Walker and Ernie exchange a glance
WALKER

(ironically)
Probably the Rules and Regulations
Committee on Uplift and Morale

He starts off Ernie continues to unload with the aid of a
couple of GIs who drift up

Inside WALKERS DUGOUT

WALKER
(into the phone)
Yes Sir Captain Walker I
see
(Then mildly ironic)
Just one prisoner or two
Naturally sir as many as we can

get

(His face shadows)
Replacements No they haven t
gotten here yet yes sir

As he hangs up the angle widens to include Warnicki
entering

WALKER
Another patrol
WARNICKI
(quietly)
Ill go
WALKER
Like hell you will Youve been on
enough
WARNICKI
(stolidly)
Every step forward is a step closer
» to home
WALKER

(looking up at
Warnicki then)
Okay Get me ten men

Warnicki starts out of the dugout Walker starts getting
ready

The scene cuts to WARNICKIS DUGOUT Suddenly through the
opening a box appears followed by Ernie followed by a GI

(Simmons) Instantly the boys come to life

ERNIE
Believe it or not its turkey on
the level

In less than a second flat theyre at work on that turkey

DONDARO
Wine You bring wine

ERNIE
(holding a bottle up)
Whats Christmas without wine After
that little repast one cigar apiece

Next we get closeups of WARNICKI and WALKER who realize
its time to go on patrol we see them going out of the
dugout Walker looking at his watch and the patrol
disappearing in the rainy night the scene fading out When
the DUGOUT fades in again the boys are in a relaxed mood
Lopez tinkles softly on his by now one-stringed guitar
Wayne puffs a corn-cob Gross chews a wad Dondaro near
Ernie is luxuriously smoking a cigar Mew is half-asleep
Although the air is cold theres a feeling of old-shoe
warmth among them

DONDARO
(stretching)
Hey Ernie you been to Hollywood
Ever know Carol

The sound of bombardment bursts into the merriment

ERNIE
(a little startled)
Well Ive met her

DONDARO
(intrigued)
Is it true shes got those great
big

Two shells slam over drowning out his words

DONDARO
Is it

ERNIE
(half-embarrassed)
Thats the rumor

DONDARO
(doubly intrigued)
Well tell me something Are they
really on the level

Two more shells slam over

ERNIE
I forgot to ask Probably

DONDARO
Klk K1k
(Then very seriously)
You been around a lot -- Washington
New York Hollywood everywhere
havent you Ernie Yknow when
this shindigs over Im gonna look

you up I might ask you to get
me a job

ERNIE
Yep

The scene cuts to the HILLSIDE then Returning wearily down
the road come Walker Warnicki and two GIs with a sullen
Nazi prisoner in tow Nearing Walkers dugout they are met
by a lieutenant

WALKER
(wearily indicating
the Nazi)
Take him down to Headquarters

LIEUTENANT
(putting the Nazi
under guard)
Replacements came up Sir

He hands Walker a list Walker takes it his face shadows

WALKER

Fine Ill assign them But
well need five more

(The lieutenant

tows off the Nazi)
Get him down to headquarters and
even if it hurts take good care of
him

GI
But good

The scene cuts to WALKERS DUGOUT as lighting a candle
Walker sinks wearily to a seat He almost dozes off but
the list of names catches his eye He tries to avoid them
but cant He lifts a bottle from under his box pours
himself a drink and starts checking off the names The
scene then cuts to WARNICKIS DUGOUT where entering
leadenly Warnicki is greeted by the others

AD LIBS
Hi Steve -- Saved you some turkey
Sarge

Warnicki silently slumps to his corner and concentrates on
his victrola

WARNICKI
(with a sudden growl)
Dont want any
The boys taken aback by this moroseness exchange glances
Ernie looks at Warnicki steadily

WAYNE
(muttering)
Sure wish hed get to hear Junior

Dondaro meanwhile has stolen across to his duffle-bag and
withdrawn a small bottle of Aphrodisiac He sniffs the
ambrosia ecstatically and secretively dabs some behind his
ears -- Thereupon in a fairly close view favoring WAYNE
and GROSS we see the latter taking off his socks as the
pungent fragrance penetrates to their corner Gross sniffs
and looks over at Wayne Wayne also sniffing looks over at
Gross They eye each other suspiciously then down at the
sock -- but shake their heads Thats a Chanel 5 from
another bottle Sniffing they look around at the others

-- The others have also begun sniffing and eyeing each other
suspiciously Their eyes focus toward innocent Ernie

ERNIE
(grinning wanly)
Its not me

WAYNE
K1lk K1k

But as Dondaro swiftly slithers out their faces light up
The candle splutters and begins to die Ernie rises and
yawns

ERNIE
Well I guess I better turn in
Good night fellows

GIS
Thanks for the merry Christmas
Ernie

He goes amid mumbled Good nights and Merry Christmases
The scene then cuts to the HILLSIDE As Ernie comes out
hunched against the cold Dondaro can be seen disappearing
down the road Ernie heads toward Walkers dugout The
distant roll of artillery is heard -- Dondaro slithers
down the village street and slips into the wine shop

Inside WALKERS DUGOUT Hollow-eyed with fatigue Walker
sits huddled over his papers The candle flickers fitfully
casting strange shadows on the dank walls Theres a great
loneliness about this man as he sits there in this little
hollow tomb carved in this foreign hillside Ernie is caught
by it as he enters Walker glances up Ernie goes to him
with a second joint of turkey he has saved for him

ERNIE
(handing it to him)
Merry Christmas Bill
WALKER
(taking it)
Merry Christmas Ernie

His eyes shadow he looks away then as if remembering
holds up the bottle

WALKER
Night cap

ERNIE
Dont mind

Ernie sinks to a seat Theres only the soft gurgling of the
bottle in the silence They lift their cups and drink Its
murderous stuff

ERNIE
(coughing)
Whats this -- a secret weapon

WALKER
(smiling)
Grappa Italian moonshine A Purple
Heart with every third drink

ERNIE
(smiling)
Id rather have some good
Albuquerque sunshine

WALKER
(wistfully)
It must be pretty nice in New
Mexico this time of the year

ERNIE
Sure is

WALKER
Always wanted to get out West --
Someday -- maybe--

ERNIE

If you do look us up That girl and
I will show you how its done
You married

WALKER
(filling his cup)
Well yes and no She wanted one
thing I wanted another She
walked out Chapter closed

He drinks shudders as the drink goes down Ernie fingers
his cup Again the silence only the wail of the wind and
the distant rumble of artillery

WALKER
Names Ive been crossing out
old names putting new names in

(he looks up and laughs)
Youre not the only writer in this
bunch Ive been writing too

He checks himself Ernie glances up understanding the
burden on Walkers heart

WALKER
Jones -- Peterson -- McCarthy --
Spidofsky -- Smith Dear Mrs
Smith your son died bravely today

on the

He fills his cup again But doesnt drink There is a short
laugh from him -- but theres no laughter in his eyes

WALKER
And the new kids coming up
Thats what gets you Some of
them have just got fuzz on their
faces

We get a close view of ERNIE listening to him

WALKERS VOICE
They dont know what its all
about And theyre scared to
death

We see them together

WALKER
I know its not my fault they
get killed but I get so I feel like
a murderer

(Bitterly)
I hate to look at em -- the new
ones

(Then almost mockingly)
Drink up Ernie Heres to Faid
Pass Salerno Anzio
beachhead

(He drinks)
Geez Im tired

ERNIE
You better try and get some sleep

WALKER
(laughing)
That reminds me of W C Fields
sure cure for insomnia Get lots of
sleep

Silence The candle flickers Ernie sips at his cup
WALKER
(fighting sleep)
Names and addresses and
hills to be taken Youd be

simply amazed at the number of hills
still to be taken

(suddenly looking

up at Ernie)
Tell me Ernie why the devil dont
you go home

ERNIE
(looking into his cup)
Ive often asked myself

WALKER
If only we could create something
good out of all this energy and all
these men
(His voice trails off
Theyre the best Ernie the
best

The view draws closer to Ernie as he stares into his cup

ERNIE

(quietly)
Yip They live in a world the other
worldll never know Even the Air
Force Up there they approach
death differently When they die
theyre well-fed and clean-shaven

(Wryly)
If thats any comfort

(He stares ahead

deeply moved)
But the GI he lives so miserable
and dies so miserable you just

He turns toward Walker stops and smiles gently Walker is
asleep in deep exhaustion head on the table Ernie rises
and puts a blanket around Walkers shoulders He looks down
at the sleeping man -- then snuffs out the candle
Theres the distant roar of artillery as the scene fades
out

H

The HILLSIDE fades in as Dondaro is returning in the pitch
before dawn a happy relaxed expression on his face He
furtively steals past Walkers dugout Walker shivering
comes out in the bone-chilling morning
WALKER
Dondaro

As Dondaro shakily approaches Walker looks him over keenly
but his tone is amiability itself The skys begun to gray

WALKER
(smiling)
Have a nice time

Expecting a lacing Dondaro is taken aback by Walkers
friendly tone He nods puzzled

WALKER
(still friendly)
Always like to see one of my men get
some relaxation
(Almost intimately)
Yknow Dondaro it would give me a
great deal of personal pleasure

Dondaro begins to beam After all the Caps human Maybe
hed like a telephone number too Walkers sudden cold
tones knife him out of his daydreams

WALKER

(incisively)
»to break every bone in your body
Goin off down there was one thing
Up here its another

(Dondaro gulps

Walker blazes)
Now get out Before I kick the--

Dondaro hastily starts to scoot Heads have begun to stick
out of the dugouts to listen to this lashing

WALKER
Wait
(Dondaro halts)
Report to Sergeant Warnicki Tell
him youre going to dig latrines for
every man in this company from here
to Rome Nice deep ones

Dondaro scoots The GIs faces light with delightful
anticipation A sudden shell-burst slams over as the scene
dissolves to a view of the HILLSIDE where wielding a
pickaxe Dondaro has dug about two feet of trench Hes
tired disgusted grimy

GROSS VOICE
Youre lucky Dondaro Youre

learning a trade

The angle widens to include several GIs ribbing him
DONDARO
When this wars over Im gonna
write a book exposin this Army

WAYNE
(leaning over
to Dondaro)
Hey Dondaro tell me confidentially
was it worth it

DONDARO
(his eyes melting)
Klk K1k

He digs with renewed vigor Suddenly theres a deep all-
encompassing drone in the sky -- a far-away surge of doom-
like sound They all look up crying out

GIS
Hey look Look

In a rising crescendo a vast armada of planes approaches
wave on wave blacking out the sky Hurrying out of his
DUGOUT Walker swiftly looks at his watch looks at the sky
and starts shouting to Warnicki--

WALKER
(crisp businesslike)
Okay Steve Lets go

WARNICKI
(shouting to the men)
Okay men This is what youve been
waiting for Okay men -- lets go
On the double

The GIs start running up excitedly falling into their
formations ready to start out

ERNIES VOICE

(heard over the scenes)
General Eisenhower had made his
decision Bomb the monastery If we
have to choose between
destroying a famous building and
sacrificing our mens lives then
our mens lives count infinitely
more And -- here was one of the
grim ironies of war -- the very
rubble of the monastery became a
fortress for the Nazis and they
stopped us cold We were right back
where we started from

We see the MONASTERY A bomb explodes on the abbey Then
three -- then six -- Then all hell -- The hillside seems to
lift -- We see that the entire company is elated at the
pasting the Monastery is getting

AD LIBS
On the button
Paste em one for me
Thats the old haymaker
Hit em on the kisser

Tons of bombs pulverize the monastery The bombardment is
volcanic Then in a long view directed toward the STONE
HOUSE and DEFILE we see the men excitedly moving out into
the defile in a general attack A GI salutes the statue in
the niche as he passes

GI
So long St Chris We wont be
seein you no more

Next we get a series of views showing the withdrawal of the
troops from the attack on Cassino Limping back our tanks
slowly grind past several overturned still burning tanks
-- This cuts to WARNICKIS DUGOUT as beaten scarcely able
to breathe our GIs stumble in and flop down in
exhaustion

Several are missing Wayne and Gross are gone Dondaro
lifts his head and looks around

DONDARO
Warnicki -- aint he back

This cuts to the HILLSIDE near the DEFILE Walker moves
tensely about hunched in his rain coat His nerve-strained
face keeps looking toward the mist-filled defile But there
is no one Only the swirling mist His lips tighten He
keeps pacing

Outside the GIs DUGOUT three GIs look up very much
concerned toward Walker

FIRST GI
Better take him some coffee and
keep your eye on him too

One of them Babyface Pete starts toward Walker with a pot
of steaming coffee

SECOND GI
(to another GI)
When are we hittin ‘em again

GI
(glancing at his watch)
Eighteen hundred

WALKER stops as Babyface Pete approaches silently offering
him coffee
WALKER

(gratefully)
No thanks
PETE
Its hot
WALKER

No thanks Pete

He continues pacing keeping his eye on the defile Babyface
moves off behind a boulder and watches Walker Still pacing
Walker anxiously glances at his watch and then toward the
defile Still only the swirling mist -- Hopelessly now
Walker slowly starts back toward the dugout But suddenly

he hears something in the defile He looks up his eyes
lighting And in a distant view of the DEFILE slowly
emerging out of the mist we see a great leaden mud-caked
figure -- a mass of fatigue and weariness -- Warnicki

Walker starts to him with a cry of joy But the cry fades
as he sees the abysmal weariness in Warnickis face

WARNICKI
(tonelessly)
Tough time gettin back sir

Walker nods and Warnicki slogs leadenly toward the dugouts

We get a close shot of WALKER staring after Warnicki His
eyes are filled with pain Then the scene cuts to WARNICKIS
DUGOUT Entering Warnicki slumps down to his corner He
does nothing but sit there for a moment just breathing
Ayrab sidles up and licks his torn mud-caked hands Then
automatically without thought Warnicki reaches down for
the one comfort that has sustained him so long His horny
blood-torn hands bring the PHONOGRAPH to his knees and
habitually as he has done so often before his thick
fingers fumble at the lever -- the disc revolves -- but now
instead of the usual grating sound there emerges from it
the sweetest softest most innocent voice in the world
Juniors childish treble and

WOMANS VOICE
Come on Junior say hello to your

Daddy
JUNIORS VOICE
(on the phonograph)
Hello daddy Hello daddy
Hello daddy Hello daddy

Hello daddy

The calloused mud-caked hand near the phonograph trembles
The view slowly moves up to WARNICKIS FACE And its a
horrible terrifying thing to see For this face of rock
this granite face this face that has endured every torture
and abomination of war is cracking Cracking as a childs
voice innocently sings on and on--

VOICE
Hello daddy Hello daddy
Hello daddy

The giant frame of the man seethes with a volcanic emotion
the tears burn out of his eyes His breath comes in short
tortured gasps And suddenly he can endure no more He rises
and breaks And its like a great heart breaking Not
weakly but like a storm suddenly gone berserk

WARNICKI
(terrifyingly
between gasps)
If it wasnt for them Id be home

with Junior Id be home with
little Junior Ill Ill kill
every mothers son of them Ill
kill them

He lunges fiercely toward the opening

DONDARO
Grab him
The phonograph goes on and on Springing at him Waters
and Moss try to stop him But he tosses them aside like
chips -- Tearing out of the dugout Warnicki bulls wildly

toward the defile tearing past Walker

WARNICKI
If it wasnt for them Id be
home with little Junior If it
wasnt for them Ill kill em
WALKER
(sharply)

Warnicki Warnicki

But Warnicki doesnt hear He has only one thought To get
at those Nazis who have destroyed so much of his and
everyones happiness To rip them apart with his own bare
hands Dondaro coming down from the road leaps at Warnicki
But Warnicki throws him aside -- Walker hurls himself in
a football tackle at the frenzied man -- The two men go down
in a heap near the ruins of the stone house But Warnicki
lashes himself free Dondaro now pounces on And Waters and
Moss But all four cant hold Warnicki in his berserk

strength From the dugout phonograph continues on
WARNICKI
(frothing fiercely)
Little Junior Little Junior Let

me go Whats the matter with you
You son of a--

His wildness seizes all of them like a contagion They
battle with him frenziedly until Walker suddenly shoots
over four sharp vicious jabs to the button and Warnicki
sags They let him down gently The phonograph winds
down stops -- Waters and Moss bend over Warnicki

Walker and Dondaro stand there panting Finally they
help Warnicki up but as they do they hear--

WARNICKIS VOICE
(muttering like a
gibbering idiot)

hello daddy hello daddy
hello daddy hello Go
on Junior say hello to daddy

hello daddy hello daddy
hello daddy

Deeply shaken Walker fights to keep from turning away The
men look to him for help

WALKER
(his voice treacherously
uneven)
Take him to the medics

But now as they lead the still gibbering Warnicki off with
Ayrab dancing playfully at his shambling feet a lieutenant
swiftly runs up to Walker (In the background the company is
forming for the attack)

WALKER
(grimly)
All right men lets do something
about that

ERNIES VOICE
The machines had done their best but
it wasnt enough Now came the time
as it does in every war for the
greatest fighting machine of them
all -- the infantry soldier -- to
go in and slug it out

The scene dissolves and is followed by a series of scenes
representing the victorious attack of the infantry
concluding with a close view of a SIGNPOST at night It
reads ROMA with an arrow pointing up ahead Then we see
the ROAD TO ROME as a long surge of troops is heading upward
toward the capital There is a spirited victorious swing to
their movement The moonlight reflects on their helmets
their rifles their armor The sound of battle is faint
intermittent far to the north

In the midst of these fresh buoyant troops is Ernie He
slogs along with them an older man reflectively noting
their swing their excited gum chewing Snatches of
conversation drift around him

ERNIE
Where you from Joe

GI
Louisiana

ERNIE
Louisiana Good

GI
(looking back
smiling)
Cassino looks a lot better from
this side

AD LIBS
All away to Rome
I got a good telephone number there

As Ernie tiredly smiles he sees someone off the road And
on the ROADSIDE with the moonlight on the HILLS in the
background we see a GI who looks as though hes been thru
battle Ernie approaches him

ERNIE
Hey fellows do you know where the
18th Infantry is

GI
This is it

ERNIE
C Company--

GI

Whats left of it

He nods over his shoulder Ernie starts up along a narrow
trail in the direction of his nod We then see him coming to
a GLEN where lying about mud-begrimed and weary are
several GIs of our company among them Babyface and Moss
They are exhausted but there is a certain sense of elation
over their victory One of the men is wearily playing a

harmonica to himself As Ernie comes up he is greeted by
one or two--

AD LIBS
Hiya Ernie--
Welcome to this side of Cassino--
Where you been Ernie

ERNIE
Hiya boys -- Finally made it
Covertly he counts heads as he looks around to see which of
the GIs of his company are still there which are gone

GI
(smiling)
Guys moving up the road look kind of
chipper dont they Ernie

ERNIE
Sure do

They look toward the troops on the main road and next in

the background a long line of GIs can be seen marching up
the road to Rome their helmets glinting in the moonlight

-- Ernie continues down the line

GI
Hi Ernie
ERNIE
Hi boys
FIRST GI
(not bitterly)
Yeah -- we kick the door open and

them guys make the grand entrance

SECOND GI
Let em have their fun -- theyre
still young

ERNIE

Got an extra chair here Havent you
eaten that dog yet

He suddenly stops as across their vision up the hills on the
opposite side of the road comes a slow line of mules
winding their way down The mules bear a burden slung across
their pack saddles the nature of which is indistinct

The MULE TRAIL is now seen and so is the burden the mules
are carrying

They are dead bodies lashed belly down across the saddles
The stiffened legs stick out awkwardly The mules are slowly
led toward a cowshed just off the road

The boys silently watch the mules being led toward a cowshed
in the background The line of troops marching toward Rome
has passed on GIs unlash the bodies and lift them from the
pack saddles and lay them one after another in the shadow
of the cowsheds stone wall

GI
(looking toward the mule
trail suddenly quietly)
Its Dondaro
They all look up and we see the MULE TRAIL from their
viewpoint Slowly carefully a GI is leading a mule with
its dead burden down the trail As he leads the mule toward
the cowshed we see that its Dondaro He looks half-dead
himself Gently he unlashes the body and slides it down the
mule For a moment the dead man is stood on his feet In the
half light he looks merely like a sick man standing there
leaning against Dondaro -- Then we see the GROUP

BABYFACE
(in a half whisper)
Its the Capn

They watch Dondaro lay Walkers body on the ground in the
shadows and sit down near him -- Then we see from another
angle Dondaro sitting there staring at Walker Slowly some
of the men across the road in the background stir and go
toward Walkers body one by one Ernie with them Several
remain behind

The men trail slowly up pausing a little distance away from
Walkers body Then one goes slowly forward and looks down
at Walkers body Ernie watches them

GI
God damn it

Thats all he says and walks away And then another GI
comes up

SECOND GI
God damn it to hell anyways

He looks down for a moment and then he too turns and goes

And now a third comes up -- an officer and looks down into

Walkers face and speaks to him directly as though he were
alive

OFFICER
Im sorry old man

And he turns away Finally Babyface files up and we see
WALKERS BODY the view including DONDARO and ERNIE Dondaro
remains immobile The Babyface runner comes up and speaks
not in a whisper but awfully tenderly

BABYFACE
I sure am sorry sir

And he too goes Ernie watches deeply moved And now
Dondaro slowly reaches out and takes Walkers dead hand into
his own and stares intently into his captains dead face
for what seems to be a long time And he never utters a
word

Finally Dondaro puts the hand down and reaches over gently
straightening the points of the captains shirt collar
Then tenderly he sort of rearranges the tattered edges of
the uniform around Walkers wound -- And this is the
gesture that breaks Ernie completely as we see him closely
He turns away sharply to hide his emotion and fighting for
control he walks away from the scene toward the moonlit

trail leading to the main road leaving Dondaro and
Walker in the shadowed background The scene then cuts to
an OFFICER
OFFICER
(quietly)
All right men -- lets go

And finally against the background of white wooden crosses
gleaming in the moonlight we see the troops marching onward
to Rome Ernie turns walks after them They go off into the
distance becoming silhouettes in the background and the
film fades out as Ernie concludes

ERNIE

That is our war and we will carry it
with us as we go from one battleground
to another until it is all over We
will win I hope we can rejoice with
victory -- but humbly -- and that all
together we will try try out of the
memory of our anguish to reassemble
our broken world into a pattern so
firm and so fair that another great
war can never again be possible

(After a pause)
For those beneath the wooden crosses
there is nothing we can do except
perhaps to pause and murmur Thanks
Pal
