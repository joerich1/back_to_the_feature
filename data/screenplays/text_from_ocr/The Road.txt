TITLE THE ROAD

EXT CAMPSITE - DAWN

A MAN of about forty and a BOY of ten are asleep camped on
tarp under a rock ledge the blackened chasm of a burnt
valley spread out below It is the same man seen earlier -
but ten years older thinner malnourished with a thick

beard They are both emaciated and exhausted their faces

hands coated in grime and soot from the burned blackened
landscape around them Ash falls on the tarp which is

synthetic blue the only color in sight
head

and

The MAN is woken by something he instinctively reaches out
to touch the BOY his hand rests on his chest and rises and
falls with each of the sleeping BOYs breaths

There is a low RUMBLE the ground starts to TREMBLE and the
BOY wakes

BOY
Papa (NO REPLY) Papa

MAN
Shh Its okay

BOY

What is it Papa

They listen as it grows NEARER and LOUDER everything
SHAKING tree roots GROANING and SPLITTING until it passes
between them with a ROAR like a subway train right beneath
them The BOY is now clinging to the MAN and crying his

buried against his chest in fear

MAN
Shh Its all right Its all
right Its gone

BOY
What was it Papa

MAN
It was an earthquake

EXT ROAD - DAY

In the burnt barren landscape through swirls of soft ash
and smoggy air the MAN appears dressed in a filthy old PARKA
with the hood up a knapsack on his back pushing a rusted
shopping CART with a bicycle mirror clamped to the handle

the BLUE tarp now covering its load The little BOY
similarly dressed with a KNAPSACK on his back shuffles
through the ash at his side - like Depression-era Dust Bowl
homeless
no

of

There is a flicker of lightning over head then more but
thunder

MAN (V0)

The clocks stopped at one seventeen
one morning There was a long shear
of bright light then a series of
low concussions

EXT MOUNTAINSIDE CRACKED ROAD - DAY
Broken asphalt the earthquake has caused a large FISSURE

open up ALONGSIDE the road with a sheer drop
THE MAN and THE BOY edge past burnt trees and scrub

MAN (V0)

Within a year there were fires on
the ridges and deranged chanting
The screams of the murdered By day
the dead impaled on spikes along
the road

EXT LAKE - DAY

They trudge past a vast lake filled with dead trees

MAN (V0)

I think its October but I cant be
sure I havent kept a calender for
5 years

EXT MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY

They truck along with the trolley through the fog the
ghostly shapes of dead trees on either side and the shapes

barren mountains in the background

MAN (V0)

Each day is more gray than the one
before Each night is darker -
beyond darkness The world gets
colder week by week as the planet
slowly dies No animals have
survived All the crops are long
gone

EXT EDGE WOODS - DAY

A tree falls behind them with a WHUMP and they jump

MAN (V0)
Someday all the trees in the world
will have fallen

pumps
rummaging through empty oil cans he upends a bin to get at
the empty oil bottles
The BOY picks up a phone on a wall and listens to the dead
earpiece

MAN (V0)

The roads are peopled by refugees
towing carts and road gangs
carrying weapons looking for fuel
and food

They head down a long straight road towards a dark
forbidding looking tunnel - a turnpike

MAN (V0)
There has been cannibalism

Cannibalism is the great fear

EXT CITY - DAY

They emerge before a view of a deserted city-state

EXT MALL - DAY

They forage in a deserted mall
There are skeletons and human bones here and there

MAN (V0)

Mostly I worry about food Always

food Food and our shoes

CU - the BOY examines the head of a moose mounted on a wall
in a SEARS hunting store

MAN (V0) (CONTD)

Sometimes I tell the boy old
stories of courage and justice -
difficult as they are to remember
All I know is the child is my
warrant and if he is not the word
of God then God never spoke

trees up the ridge where a FOREST FIRE is burning CRACKLING
in the distance He stands staring at the fire the warmth

and light moving him enlivening him and not frightening him

at all The BOY has got up and appears at his side yawning

sun came out
The BOY catches the snowflake in his hand surprised

EXT ROADPLAIN - DAY

They travel along the road through drifting wood smoke
smoke

pouring off the ground like mist and thin black trees
burning

like candles on the snowy ridge

the
tarmac Their feet stick in the molten tarmac it sucks at
their shoes and they stop Just ahead they see a set of foot
prints in the tar and study them

around for the last one or two The MAN opens his knapsack

the fire and produces a packet of COCOA He fixes a cup of

The MAN and the BOY truck along the blacktop
At the crest of a hill they come to FADED BILLBOARDS
advertising MOTELS and stop The BOY notices a sign in the
distance which has words painted over a faded
advertisement

odd nonsensical Biblical ramblings about bones and the
dead The MAN follows the BOYs gaze and reads BEHOLD THE

VALLEY OF SLAUGHTER - JEREMIAH 196

INT TUNNEL - DAY

The MAN has his arm around the boy as they push the cart
cautiously ahead acutely aware of all thats around them
They pass footprints in the dried sludge on the ground Ash
and litter blowing about and a handful of MUMMIFIED DEAD
REFUGEES appear along the sides of the tunnel sitting and
lying on camp stretchers their bags and supplies long since
looted They are shrivelled and drawn like latterday

shoeless a couple of men a woman a small child and a DOG
The MAN stares at the group

The BOY stares at the small child and then at the mummified
DOG transfixed The MAN puts out his hand for the BOY to
take - the BOY takes his hand and the MAN moves him on

Now the BOYs hand rests on the MANs chest as he sleeps

MAN breathes stertorously wheezing a little and the BOYS
small hand goes up and down on his chest

Suddenly the MAN wakes and rolls onto his side listening
the revolver lying beside him He slips his hand onto the
revolver and raises his head slowly He looks around -
nothing but the sound of a distant DIESEL ENGINE He looks

the BOY fast asleep When he looks back at the tunnel he
a nightmarish vision

POV MAN - Exiting the tunnel shuffling through the ash a
group of HOODED MEN some in gas masks and filthy biohazard
suits slouching along coughing casting their heads from
side to side and swinging clubs and lengths of pipe - a ROAD
GANG The MAN listens to the sound of a DIESEL TRUCK behind
the gang

MAN
Quickly Quick
The BOY jolts awake as the MAN shoves his pistol in his

grabs the boy by the hand They slide out of the car and
crouch on the ground the BOY is frozen with fear

MAN (CONTD)

back down again

MAN (CONTD)

You okay Its all right come

They rush down the embankment into the trees alongside the
turnpike

EXT TURNPIKE UNDERPASS - DAY

They run through the woods The truck is heard in the
background the motor missing and SPUTTERING coils of

diesel smoke coiling through the woods The motor dies with

flapping RATTLE and theres SILENCE

The MAN and the BOY crouch in frozen silence the Truck now
on the overpass nearby dangerously exposed to the view of
the Gang They listen to the GANG TALKING and raising the
hood of the truck

The MAN puts his arm around the BOY and draws his pistol as
they see the truck begin to roll the GANG pushing it but
it coughs and stalls again

The MAN sees one of the GANG MEMBERS coming down the
embankment unbuckling his belt He is emaciated in dirty
blue overalls and a gas company cap and has a long beard

square at the bottom and a bad tattoo of a bird on his neck
He doesnt stop just keeps coming closer and closer until
hes just feet away almost on top of them He unzips his
pants and takes a piss As he stands pissing his eyes roam
around - at any moment he could look to the side and see

crouching there
The MAN is wide-eyed gun ready eyes darting from the GANG
MEMBER to the BOY to the GUN The GANG MEMBER rolls his
studies

at

shoulders and exercises his neck he looks down and

the steam coming off his piss

The MAN silently trains his pistol at the head of the GANG
MEMBER who as if by instinct rolls his head around and
looks right at him

MAN
Just keep it coming
The GANG MEMBER sees the gun and stops pissing looks back

the truck zips his fly
MAN (CONTD)
Dont look at them Look at me If

you call out youre dead Where you

Where dyou get all that stuff

GANG MEMBER

MAN
What are you eating

GANG MEMBER
Whatever we can find

MAN
Whatever you can find huh

GANG MEMBER

Yeah

Now the GANG MEMBER looks at the BOY causing the MAN To
raise the revolver and cock it

POV GANG MEMBER - he looks down the barrel at the magazine
and sees empty space

GANG MEMBER (CONTD)

You wont shoot that thing You

aint got but two shells Maybe

shot

On the over pass the ROAD GANG are looking around MURMURING
as they notice one of their number missing

MAN

Maybe But you wont Itll be

through your skull and inside your

brain before you can hear it

The MAN steps closer and aims the gun at the MANs forehead
hammer back ready

and

MAN (CONTD)

To hear it youll need a frontal
lobe and things with names like
colliculus and temporal gyrus and
you wont have them anymore because
theyll just be soup

GANG MEMBER
Are you a doctor

MAN
Im not anything anymore

GANG MEMBER
We got a hurt man Itd be worth
your while

The MAN glances in the direction of the ROAD GANG then back
at the GANG MEMBER who is still eyeing the BOY The BOY is

sitting with his hands on top of his head

peeking out

through his arms terrified as the tension escalates

MAN
If you look at him again Ill shoot
you in the head

GANG MEMBER

Ill bet that boy is hungry Why
dont you all just come onto the
truck Get something to eat Aint
no need to be such a hard ass

MAN
You dont have anything to eat
Lets go

GANG MEMBER
I aint going nowheres

MAN
You think I wont kill you but

GANG MEMBER

You know what I think I think
youre chickenshit You never
killed a man in your life

He drops his belt on the ground with a CLATTER a canteen
eyes

of

rolls

by

army pouch hanging from it The MAN eyes the army pouch
the GANG on the road - and notices for the first time some
them are wearing the same army pouches

One is banging his stick on the side of the truck to call
their lost member The MAN is distracted by this and when he
looks up the GANG MEMBER has taken two silent steps and is
standing between him and the BOY holding a knife

MAN

What do you think youre going to

do with that

Without a word the GANG MEMBER dives and grabs the BOY

and lands on his feet holding the BOY against his chest with
his knife at his throat Simultaneously the MAN drops to his
knees trains the pistol and fires from six feet away
shooting the GANG MEMBER in the forehead He falls back and
lies with blood bubbling from the wound eyes open the BOY
lying in his lap in shock deafened expressionless covered
with gore and mute as a stone

The GANG hear the loud SHOT and freeze they start looking
around them more urgently now The MAN grabs the dazed BOY

the hand and yells but in his deafness the BOY hears only a
MUTED soup of words

MAN (MUTED )

Move Lets go

The MAN shoves the pistol in his belt hoists the BOY onto
his shoulders and sets off down the road at a run

EXT WOODS - DAY

They crash through the woods the MAN straining to keep the
BOY aloft and find a path through the trees - the BOY
clutching the MANs head with both hands
Theres a sickening THUD and the MAN falls the BOY flying
off with a cry The MAN struggles to gather his wits unsure
whether hes been felled by another man

MAN (MUTED )
Come on Get up get up quickly
The MAN swings the BOY onto his shoulders and runs

EXT WOODSTURNPIKE - DAY

The MAN and BOY stagger through trees and the man drops to
his knees letting the BOY down They are back by the
turnpike again They listen and watch utterly exhausted and
out of breath the MAN is wheezing the BOY at his side
holding his hand staring in shock still

MAN
Shh Its okay now Youre going to
be OK

POV BOY - the BOY can still HEAR nothing temporarily deaf
But he sees the MAN talking and looking around through 360
degrees trying to work out where its safe to go

MAN (CONTD)
Come on
He grabs the BOYs hand and they take off again

EXT WOODS - EVENING

The MAN pulls out blankets from his knapsack The BOY sits
staring shocked as the MAN tries to wipe the blood and gore
from his face but its thick and congealed now His hands
tremble as he tries to pick it from the BOYs hair

MAN

Its okay its okay now

Frightened by the BOYs muteness he wraps him in a blanket
unzips his parka and holds him close under the parka
The MAN picks up his revolver checks the chamber only one
bullet left He eyes the flickering shadows in the distance
and then eyes the BOY making minute calculations of
distance calibrating the space between the ROAD GANG and

the

BOY He holds the revolver up and cocks it

MAN (V0) (CONTD)

I try to look like any common

traveling killer but my heart is

hammering When it comes to the boy

I have only one question Can you

do it When the time comes

There is no moon but not far away perhaps 30 yards a
firey

TORCH makes its way through the woods About 50 yards away

from that another TORCH is being used to search shadows

flicker ominously The sounds of TWIGS snapping underfoot
and

BRANCHES being broken as the ROAD GANG searches wordlessly

just BREATHING heavily through their masks and beards The

MAN clutches the BOY tighter and stifles a cough

They remain frozen like this unable to budge

FADE OUT

EXT EMBANKMENT - DAWN

They are by a thin toxic rust-red stream slushy ice at
the

edges and gray froth The MAN leans down and pushes ice away
and scoops up a hand full of gray water He runs it through
the boys hair to wash it and the BOY flinches with cold He
rubs more icy water into the BOYs hair roughly quickly
with a sense of panic as he helplessly tries to-wash out
lumps of flesh and blood The BOY is weeping silently and
shivering from the extreme cold as the MAN picks out the
dried gore and washes the hair clean

MAN
Its no use crying You have to
talk to me
clumsily

He takes the blanket and dries the BOYs hair as he talks

MAN (CONTD)

Im not going to let anything

happen to you Im going to take

care of you Im always going to

try and be here for you and Im

going to kill anybody who touches

you

He smooths the BOYs hair down with shaking fingers

trying to brush it out of his eyes a fatherly instinct to
make the BOY neat

MAN (CONTD)

Because thats my job Do you

understand

When hes through the MAN lifts the BOYs thin arms puts a
vest over his head then a ragged sweater then he folds the
BOY into his parka zips it up to the neck and kisses him on
the top of the head

The MAN grabs his knapsack tips it upside down rummages
inside - its empty

MAN (CONTD)

Come on we need to get the cart

EXT EMBANKMENT BY TUNNEL EXIT - DAY

Approaching the embankment the MAN walks quickly and
stealthily wired listening to the silence straining to
hear sure hes being watched

The BOY stumbles along behind slower fatigued makingthe
MAN anxious The MAN leaves the boy hiding

MAN (WHISPERS )
Wait here

He starts to climb the embankment and hears little running
FOOTSTEPS as the BOY comes after him he turns to face the
BOY urgently exasperated

MAN (WHISPERS) (CONTD)

No I need you to wait Ill hear

you if you call Ill just bea

little ways and Ill be able to

hear you if you get scared and you

He walks off but hears the little BOYs FOOTSTEPS running
after him again - he turns around

MAN

The BOYs face crinkles up and a tear rolls down

MAN (CONTD)

say Take the gun

The BOY freezes refusing to take the gun

MAN (CONTD)

The BOY shakes his head

Between them lies the revolver seen earlier The WOMAN picks

As the crow flies

MAN
It means going in a straight line
POV MAN - In the background something catches his eye and

he
FOCUSES ON
A frieze of HUMAN HEADS dried with taut grins and shrunken
eyes perched on wooden poles Some are tattooed with
targets

and runic slogans Some are skinless with signs and words
inked onto them One has suture marks etched on it like a
blue print for assembly

BOY
There arent any crows are there

conversation distracted and not seeing the heads

towards the woods and off the road

just got halfway or something and
then they were too tired Would

EXT EDGE OF WOODS - EVENING

On the edge of the wood the MAN and the BOY stop to examine
footprints in the snow

The MAN listens and hears the low THUDDING of BULL DRUMS in
the distance He looks at the exhausted BOY a moment

MAN
We cant go back on the road

BOY
Why Papa

MAN
I think someones coming

The BOY stares at the tracks The MAN stares in both
directions examining the road in the distance He moves a
few paces and notices tied to a dead sapling a thin red
neckerchief He takes a few steps and through a gap in the
trees sees a clearing - snow and a mass of BLOOD RED
FOOTPRINTS the icy snow stained blood red like a sorbet A
killing floor

BOY
Will they see our tracks

MAN

some sort of ARMY wearing the same red neckerchiefs and
carrying weapons searching predatory

WIDER - we see that only 30 feet away concealed amongst the
trees the MAN and BOY are crouched in blankets watching
The two MILITANTS stop and look around as if they sense the
BOY and the MAN - who freeze frightened to breathe The
MILITANTS sniff the air menacingly

One of them walks over to a stone by the side of the road
leans down and starts sharpening his lance made from a the
straightened coil spring of a car The MAN and the BOY watch

wide-eyed Eventually the MILITANTS walk off up the road
BOY

What are we going to do
No answer

EXT DEEP IN THE WOODS - (CAMP 10) - EVENING

on the ground and blankets on top Out of the murky sky more
gray snow is falling The MAN is distracted by a sudden
noise the LOUD CRACK of sheering wood - this time very
close He looks around just as

Out of nowhere a tree branch sails down barely missing
landing with a heavy WHUMP just feet away

MAN

Move Quickly

He tries to get the BOY to his feet but he is limp staring
around blearily exhausted

They hear another loud WHUMP Then the GROAN of timber and

another WHUMP as trees start to keel over around them The

MAN grabs the BOY and runs as best he can through the snow

and falling trees They have abandoned their blankets tarp
and backpacks

BOY

Just keep moving run

They rush through the woods as more and more trees fall one

after the other WHUMP WHUMP WHUMP great loads of snow

falling from limbs to the ground with a BOOM setting the

themselves

under a fat fallen tree to shield themselves

painful moment He takes the bloodstained surgical mask from
his face his breath foggy in the cold he wrings out the
blood and saliva puts his head between his knees and coughs
until he can cough no more gasping for breathe bloody

unspooling from his lips into the sand like scarlet twine
while the BOY watches weeping silently

MAN
We have to leave the cart I cant
push it anymore

EXT BOAT LAUNCH - DAY

They are trudging along a concrete boat ramp by the beach
road the beach below the BOY carrying a small-suitcase

leans

impossibly breathless his lungs packing up They stop at
the

water edge where the road reaches the sea

The BOY takes his hand gently

BOY

stands

watching him eyes welling with tears

the MANs chest and goes to sleep there rising and falling
with his fathers breathing

irregularly as the MANs breath rattles in his lungs

EXT CARBEACH - DAWN

FLASHBACK - or the MANS last ever dream The MAN and the
WOMAN snooze in the car - an ordinary young couple nestled
together in the early morning sun light The MAN wakes and
looks at his sleeping wife smooths her hair tenderly very
much in love as she sleeps
His hand on her wakes her she looks at him surprised and
pleased smiles

WOMAN
Hello
She kisses him and they look at the blue ocean and the
white
sand and green sea grass and she puts an arm around him
MAN (VO)
If I were God I would have made the
world just so and no different
And so I have you I have you
