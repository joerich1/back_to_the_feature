I know what you’re going to say
This is too much and I put you on
the spot in front of everyone -

MAGGIE
-- umm yeah

JASON

-but you want a winter wedding so
your honeymoon will seem less
summer-touristy and more jet- -set
traveler - and so you won’t melt
because you hate the way you look
when you melt even though I think
it’s cute and I know you’ve been
waiting to start travelling and
having adventures until you had the
right person to do that with and
you know I’ve never been anywhere
either and I’d want to go
everywhere as long as it was with

element of romance - and surprise

Maggie approaches the corner It’s drizzling a little bit

She flips up her hood - no umbrella She stands waits
Then the downpour begins

She looks for an awning to stand under - none She’s
drenched Does she stay - does she go

She leans out into the street to look for him A car HONKS
loudly as it splashes her and soaks her more

MAGGIE
Great

She looks the other way and sees Lobsterman on his bike In
the downpour he doesn’t see another car coming -

MAGGIE (CONTD)
Watch out

Cam looks behind him - as Maggie tries to pull him - or is
the bag of lobster rolls - out of the way of the car

Thrown off-balance Cam goes flying - Maggie with him - in one
direction bike in the other

The Messenger bag opens the brown paper bag full of lobster
goodness flies out - and lands in a puddle

out of the bag and the lobster rolls plop into the puddle

MAGGIE
Oh I can do the minimum - boil
water I can make a mean grilled
cheese But cook like you No
Even when I follow the recipes
exactly - it’s missing something

Cam heats a pan throws ingredients in
CAM

It’s missing someone having done
all the work for you

MAGGIE
(grinning)
Possibly But without people like
me who appreciate amazing food what
would people like you who make the
amazing food do

CAM
Best excuse for laziness I’ve ever
heard
Cameron starts expertly chopping -
MAGGIE
Besides - Id be seasoning every
dish with my fingertips -

CAM
No you wouldnt

MAGGIE
Yes I would
No you wouldn’t because you’d
learn
Things are starting to sizzle
MAGGIE
Mmmm that smells heavenly That’s
butter isn’t it Real butter

Without even realizing she drifts into the apartment a few
steps Cam throws a few more ingredients into the pan

Maggie takes a deep breath Sighs A few more steps in Cam
shakes the pan as the ingredients begin to meld together

Maggie entranced a few steps closer - eyes on the pan as
Cam scoops the delectable lobster meat into a perfectly done
roll and presents it to her She takes a bite

MAGGIE (CONTD)
Ahhhh

She closes her eyes and takes another bite Mmmmm
She opens her eyes Wide Cam brandishes a knife at her
Maggie gasps - and drops the lobster roll

MAGGIE (CONT’D)
What the hell are you doing

CAM
Giving you a fair go at chopping
for your supper

He reverses the knife blade to himself handle to her and
offers it to her They look at the lobster-roll on the floor

MAGGIE

She bends to pick it up He gets to it first throws it out

MAGGIE (CONT’D)

He indicates the cutting board She hesitates

CAM (CONTD)
You’re the one with the knife

He pulls some more ingredients out of the fridge - starts to
put them together to cook

MAGGIE
How did you learn to cook
CAM
I followed a lobsterman home in the
middle of the night
MAGGIE
Seriously

CAM
I’m from Australia -

MAGGIE
Not South Philly I couldn’t place
the accent
He puts down a plate of sauteed prawns over pasta

She takes

CAM
And I travelled a lot from the time
I was 16 and when I ran low on
money I’d hang around the back of
restaurants offer to wash dishes
chop whatever for meals
Sometimes I stayed a while
sometimes they paid me a bit There
isn’t a chef in the world who
doesn’t fall for someone who loves
their food and wants to know how
they do it - Like you

MAGGIE
Oh I just want the food

He hands her a pepper She holds it up and talks to it

MAGGIE
Don’t blame me T promise this

She proceeds to try to chop the pepper -
CAM
Blimey - you weren’t kidding
That’s not chopping that’s
torturing

MAGGIE

He takes the knife and goes to work
MAGGIE

He sets some plates down on the table -

MAGGIE
No you’re not are you

ANTONY
This happens all the time when
people get engaged It’s the
pheromones - a woman goes off the
market and the men they can sniff
that out It makes their
competitive instincts go wild He
kissed you - no worries

He steps back from pinning

ANTONY (CONT’D
Don’t move too much - getting the
little bloodstains out is a
nightmare But look at you -

Maggie looks at herself in the mirror Much better

We know the woman she’s interviewing - it’s Lisa

LISA
No Well would you count the mouse
we can’t trap as a pet We’ve named
him Butch

MAGGIE
I think we can discount Butch

LISA
I just don’t want him to say we do
have a pet when we don’t have a pet
but we do joke that we have a pet
Butch The un-trappable mouse

MAGGIE
Relax

LISA
Im relaxed

MAGGIE
You seem really nervous

LISA
I’m not nervous

Then maybe you’re hungry because
Ive watche you eat off all your
lipstick in the last twenty
minutes

Lisa digs in her bag for a mirror Gives up - takes a cell
phone self portrait Looks at it

LISA
Yeah I did AND on the teeth
Good

MAGGIE
Do you have anything to be nervous
about

LISA

Is that a trick question That’s a
trick question

MAGGIE
It’s not a trick question - it’s a
pretty straightforward question

LISA
I’m nervous because we screwed this
up the first time - and now we’re
here for a second time and it’s
horrendous Which has nothing to do
with you just the situation you
seem perfectly lovely I just I
don’t know what I’d do without him
Weve been together every day for
six years -

MAGGIE
Where did you meet

LISA
Culinary school Second day there
he made an impassioned plea for the
school to donate the food we made
in class to a local homeless
shelter and somehow it went from
donating to us cooking for the
shelter once a week On the
school’s dime That charming accent
- sucks them in every time d could
listen to that man talk all day

MAGGIE
Do you know your husband’s family

LISA
Well that’s complicated

MAGGIE
Complicated

Maggie writes in Lisa’s folder making Lisa jittery

LISA
We’re supposed to be coordinated on
our answers right But we’re not -
the truth is everything went to
hell between them after his mom
died and no matter how much I tried
to persuade him he wouldn’t make
the first move to get things back
on track So I did - which is where
the complicated comes in - his dad
and I have been emailing weve
talked despite myself I like the
old guy and I see how sad he is

(MORE )
LISA (CONTD)
about how he let things get but my
husband he doesn’t know I’m
talking to his dad so he’s going
to say were not talking to his
family when I am and if you tell
him that he’1ll kill me so

MAGGIE
Electric toothbrush or regular

LISA
Seriously

MAGGIE
Seriously

LISA
Me electric Him - I can’t get to
stop flossing in front of the TV in
the living room

with each other should have a way
to do that Nothing makes me
happier than to see those swearing
in ceremonies Nothing makes me
happier than making sure a married
couple gain lawful permanent
residency and get to stay and raise
their families here And there are
ways to do that There are rules

kissing another woman is -
