EXT FOOTE ESTATE - BACKYARD - SAME DAY

Celia delicately prunes two rosebushes Her long pink
fingernails wrap easily around a pair of sheers

As Celia stands back to admire her work We widen to see the
Foote estate Ancient oaks dripping in Spanish moss surround
a perfectly manicured lawn Tara pales in comparison
Oddly the two rosebushes have been planted in the center of
the lawn jeopardizing the Antebellum Feng Shui

“Bout the best lookin man in all

and rolls out from under him
CELIA

Johnny brushes hair from Celias face

JOHNNY

Celia seductively bites her lower lip

CELIA

Johnnys hand slides up her thigh

INT LEEFOLT HOME - KITCHEN - LATER THAT DAY

Bridge over Skeeter smokes while watching through a window
as Minny arrives in Hillys car Skeeter blows smoke toward

Aibileen slowly turns back to Skeeter

AIBILEEN
No maam I couldnt

SKEETER
Do you have an address for her or
anything
Aibileen shrugs her shoulders reeling it all back in
Just then Elizabeth walks into the kitchen holding papers
stapled together She looks between Aibileen and Skeeter

ELIZABETH

something
Skeeter and Aibileen shake their heads
Elizabeth hands Skeeter the papers Home Help Sanitation

with a rusted-out tin roof

Two clapboard rooms are separated by an open breezeway The
front door is cracked opened

Skeeter gets out and walks toward Constantines home

INT CONSTANTINES HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Skeeter enters to find only a small bed dresser table
rocking chair and a wood burning stove
Past intruders have long since taken anything of value

As Skeeter approaches Constantines bed an OPOSSUM scurries
out from underneath

Skeeter screams as the opossum runs out the door Her eyes
suddenly catch something

Lying on the bed is an OLD CORN PIPE

Skeeter picks it up and brings it to her face Her eyes
begin to well up
WIGS

the point of view of the help
These colored women raise white
children and then twenty years

Stein that we love them and they
love us yetwe dont even let
them use the toilet in the house
Miss Steins swivels her chair back around and sits up

MISS STEIN
Im listening

SKEETER
Margaret Mitchell glorified the
mammy figure who dedicates her
whole life to a white family but no
oneever asked Mammy how she felt
about it There is both undisguised
hate for white women and an
inexplicable love but nobody ever
talks about it down here

bus station on the news Oy They
jammed fifty-five Negroes in a jail
built for four
Skeeter panics

SKEETER
I already have a maid

Skeeter cant believe what just came out of her mouth

She enters the bathroom and closes the door
