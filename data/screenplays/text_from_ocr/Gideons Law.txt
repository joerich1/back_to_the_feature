A RUSH OF NOISE
ROARING V6 SCREECHING TIRES

CUT TO

INT SPEEDING CAR - DAY

THE DRIVER white-knuckles the wheel Fights to keep control
Fights just to breathe --

Hes drenched in blood Chest and gut-shot WET CRIMSON
saturates his shirt his jacket his jeans

Excruciating pain racks his body he spasms his foot nails
the gas his agonized scream buried by --

THE ENGINE HOWLING TO THE REDLINE

EXT EXPRESSWAY - DAY
The car swerves violently Cuts in front of a delivery truck

AN AIR-HORN BLASTS The trucker hits the brakes Lights up
the tires Spews a curtain of smoke

The car hurtles past We glimpse the drivers door Three
bullet holes drilled clean through the sheet metal

Somewhere up ahead A POLICE CRUISER

INT SPEEDING CAR - CONTINUOUS

The driver aims directly toward the police unit

EXPRESSWAY

The car slices across the lanes catches the rear of the
police cruiser spins it out before SLAMMING into the median

The steel barrier takes the hit Does its job and forces the
careening vehicle straight --

SPARKS FLY A PAINED SHRIEK OF METAL
Other drivers swerve around the accident Brake to a halt

TWO OFFICERS bail from the patrol unit Hustle back toward
the crashed car --

OFFICER DELAVAN wrenches the passenger door open
INT CRASHED CAR - CONTINUOUS

He sees the slumped bloodied driver Crawls inside Checks
the mans carotid artery finds a pulse --

OFFICER DELAVAN
(shouts to partner)
-- multiple GSW call it in
He struggles to staunch the flow of blood

Notices something clenched in the drivers hand

a small plastic casing

EXT CRASHED CAR —- DAY
The cops partner gestures for folks to remain in their cars
He keys the radio mic pinned to his shoulder Calls it in

CUT TO BLACK
FADE IN

INT SHANES APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY

SHANE GIDEON 25 stands at the mirror He straightens his
police officers uniform It looks good on him but the cop
in the mirror stares back as if regarding a usurper

Shane turns away and crosses to the bed where his GIRLFRIEND
is still sleeping buried under the sheet He playfully pats
her shapely behind then reaches under the bed

Pulls out a leather utility belt Pouches for cuffs mace
radio his 40 cal Smith and Wesson and a spare magazine

He straps on the belt Feels its weight

OPEN LIVING KITCHEN AREA
Messy like it gets when you both work long hours

A half-finished chess game waits on the coffee table A Post-
It informs -- CHECK A smudged lipstick kiss below

Shane analyzes the board Slides his rook into position and
scribbles a note in reply -- MATE IN 3 xox

EXT SHANES APARTMENT - DAY

Shane unlocks a gracefully aging Mustang parked at the curb
INT SHANES MUSTANG (MOVING) - DAY
He twists the mirror so he can see himself
SHANE
You know how much I love you
(pauses tries again)
Alicia you know I I crap

He passes a mini-mall Glimpses a Hallmark store

EXT CITY STREET - LATER

Shanes Mustang crawls through bumper-to-bumper traffic

INT SHANES MUSTANG (MOVING) - DAY

Romantic cards lie strewn on the passenger seat Shane holds
one in his hand reading

SHANE
Im so lucky I found you my dearest

He tosses that crappy card Plucks another off the seat
SHANE (CONTD)
You make my world complete You

complete my world --

He passes the brick edifice of the 17th Precinct Pulls into

INT POLICE PARKING STRUCTURE - DAY

Lowering his window Shane enters the numeric security code
Ahead an electric gate swings open

Shane drives up the dimly lit ramp and finds a space

Locking the Mustang he strolls toward the precinct entrance
passing a demarcation line beyond which PATROL CARS are parked
The vehicles regimented Ready to roll

Shane pushes through the double doors into the precinct

INT 17TH PRECINCT - CORRIDOR - DAY

OFFICER MAHONE 22 strides out the locker room into the
corridor blocks Shanes path

A beat then Mahone steps aside but instead of holding the
door for Shane he lets it go a shit-eating grin on his face
MAHONE
My bad Thought youd be quicker

Shane doesnt condescend to reply as Mahone walks away

INT LOCKER ROOM - DAY

Thirty lockers which have seen better days Gunmetal gray
Names written on duct-tape stuck across most doors

OFFICER CORTEZ shuts his locker Sees Shane

CORTEZ
You hanging in man

SHANE
Sure

CORTEZ

Everyone makes mistakes you know
Cortez heads for the door

SHANE
Hey Cortez Thanks

Cortez glances back with a nod leaves Shane alone in the room

Shane reaches inside his locker Takes a small box down from
the top shelf Opens it

The contents as scary looking as the barrel of a loaded gun --
-- a diamond engagement ring

OFFICER DELAVAN (0S)
«- goddamn guy came --

Shane returns the box Snaps his locker shut as TWO COPS enter

OFFICER DELAVAN (CONTD)
-- out of nowhere Wham

SECOND COP
Heard he took two in the chest

OFFICER DELAVAN
Seriously messed up Tough bastard
was still breathing when the bus got
on scene --

They fall silent when Shane steps into view Nothing but
contempt on their faces as they watch him leave
INT BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

A couple of EAGER ROOKIES already in their chairs at the front
of the room Notebooks on standby

MORE OFFICERS amble in Sitting according to the unwritten
rule Old Hands to the back

Shane takes his seat in the second row A YOUNG OFFICER offers
a brusque nod -- then a smile twitches his lips

Off the guys look Shane sees a red laser dot on his chest

Shane jerks sideways Good reflexes -- but he bumps into
another cop

COP
Hey

Shane mutters an apology He looks toward the doorway Finds
Mahone standing nonchalantly wearing that cheesy-ass grin

Mahone lowers his Taser gun Holsters it on his hip

MAHONE
Kinda skittish there

Shane bites back a retort refusing to be baited

Mahone steps toward him expecting Shane to move aside -- only
Shane holds his ground

A beat then Mahone smirks and strolls on by heading to the
back of the room

Hes warmly welcomed by the seasoned hands despite his youth
OFFICER WATKINS glances up Gives Mahone an atta-boy pat on
the shoulder

OFFICER WATKINS
Heard ‘bout that vertical you guys
rode on Thats good work

Mahone nods thanks

The room grows quiet as SGT JACK CAULDER 40s steps to the
podium

Caulder opens his briefing folder
SGT CAULDER

We have an update on yesterdays
Expressway shooting
A few cops glance in Officer Delavans direction
SGT CAULDER (CONTD)
The doctors at Commonwealth are
telling us the vic a Michael Palmer

coma so we dont know maybe the
attack was personal or maybe weve
got a shooter thinks its open season
on the 71 Be vigilant
(beat )

‘Kay weve got a report outta RHD

CUT TO

EXT BUSY STREET - DAY

Pedestrians crowd the sidewalk An occasional HORN barks in
protest as the traffic lurches in fits and starts

INT TOYOTA CAMRY (MOVING) - DAY

An attractive CITY GIRL 20s checks her watch Strums her
glossy crimson nails on the steering wheel

The traffic inches forward A gap opens but the stop light
ahead turns red She brakes --

A LOUD BANG
Her head whiplashes as some idiot rear-ends her car
She massages her neck Hurts like hell but nothings broken

She glares at the rearview mirror A gray Suburbans planted
on her bumper

EXT BUSY STREET - DAY
She pulls over to the curb The SUV follows

Its DRIVER a businessman climbs out

INT TOYOTA CAMRY - DAY

The young woman fishes through her purse finds her insurance
card and a pen

She steps out leaving the keys in the ignition
EXT TOYOTA CAMRY - DAY
She checks the damage The Camrys bumpers crumpled

The SUV driver strolls over Offers a casual shrug not about
to admit it was his fault

CITY GIRL
What You didnt see the light

The steady flow of pedestrians continues past

ACROSS THE STREET

A STRANGER stands in the shadows of a storefront Watching
events play out

STRANGERS VANTAGE POINT

The young woman jots a note in her pad She doesnt see the
driver taking something out of his pocket --

A split-second later with a flicker of movement he jabs it
into her wrist -- she jerks away Sends the object flying
into the middle of the street

Anger and confusion suffuse her face

A few pedestrians stop and stare Uncertain whats going on
But no one wanting to get involved --

EXT BUSY STREET - DAY

The woman sways Her legs suddenly like rubber the driver
catching her as she falls

Lightheaded she doesnt seem to realize whats happening

He leads her toward his vehicle Her eyes roll up and she
passes out as he dumps her inside the back seat

PASSERBY
Hey What are you doing

The SUV driver gets behind the wheel Shoots a look at the
guy back off pal

PASSERBY (CONTD)
Hey Im talking to --

The SUV speeds away The passerby lucky not to become roadkill
A tire crunches over the object in the street -- a hypodermic
syringe

The crowd finally galvanized into action People dialing 911

But with everyones attention focused on the departing SUV
no one notices the stranger who drives the Camry away

CUT TO

INT BRIEFING ROOM - MINUTES LATER

As Caulder concludes the briefing a clerk brings in an
additional report

Shane turns around as the Captain enters the room

CAPTAIN BARNES (CONTD)

Sgt Caulder suppresses a grin behind Shanes back

SHANE
Cap
CAPTAIN BARNES

Shanes jaw tightens

SHANE

CAPTAIN BARNES

the waiver before you roll

SHANE
Yes sir

Shane gets going leaving Tom and Caulder alone in the room
Caulders smile fades

CAPTAIN BARNES
Something on your mind Jack

SGT CAULDER
You know what I think

CAPTAIN BARNES
I know he let you down --

SGT CAULDER
I went through the door He froze
Left me in the wind

CAPTAIN BARNES
I read your report But its time
to let it rest Hell come right

SGT CAULDER
Anyone else woulda been gone

A beat
CAPTAIN BARNES
Leaking that report that was a low
blow Turned him into a damn pariah

Caulder shrugs Shit happens

CAPTAIN BARNES (CONTD)
So as you know I know Sergeant

SGT CAULDER
Cop got no confidence in himself

the street Captain So you know

He squares his shoulders expecting a rebuke

Instead Tom looks worn down Knows Caulders right

INT PRECINCT LOBBY - DAY

A civilian loiters near the bronze memorial plaque Names of
those who worked the 17th and paid the ultimate price

VISITOR badge stuck to his jacket lapel

SHANE (0S)

Shane heads across the bullpen A gray cube farm

Richard watches him go then returns his attention to the names
on the plaque

INSERT MEMORIAL PLAQUE
1991 - Officer FRANK GIDEON
Richard notes the name then moves along the wall to where a
WANTED PINBOARD is littered with mugshots FBI pictures of
felons and a couple of work ups

He looks around as Shane returns

SHANE
Any questions before we get started

Richard glances again at the name beside 1991

SHANE (CONTD)
My father I was six

RICHARD
Im sorry

A burst of STATIC from Shanes radio He squelches the volume

SHANE
What is it you wanted to see

Richard pulls a small pad and pen from his pocket
RICHARD
Where you hold your briefings where

you keep evidence Those would be
most relevant

A small workspace where officers can prep items to be logged
into evidence

Shane KNOCKS on the inner door Its locked by a physical key
A matronly EVIDENCE OFFICER opens the door Appraises Richard

SHANE
This gentlemans researching a book

EVIDENCE OFFICER
Hmmm

She resolutely blocks the doorway Doesnt return Richards
limp smile A long beat then she moves aside so he can look

SHANE
Rooms always crammed

Indeed it is Floor to ceiling Everything labeled bagged
and tagged A cluster of confiscated firearms in one corner

RICHARD
Certainly looks like you have
everything squared away

SHANE
Guns Drugs Cash Gangbangers
aisles of smiles

Richard eyes a half dozen laptops and high-tech gizmos

EVIDENCE OFFICER

Data-crimes Fastest growing business

RICHARD
This rooms staffed around the clock

SHANE
Daywatch and mid since the cutbacks

EVIDENCE OFFICER
(humorless )
We close at lunch

Richard manufactures a smile

The Evidence Officer shows him a pass-through lock-box

EVIDENCE OFFICER (CONTD)
When no ones here they can bag it
and tag it Post small items through
Then we log everything to keep the
chain of custody
INT CORRIDOR - DAY
Shane and Richard return to the corridor

RICHARD
I imagine only your Evidence Officers
have keys to that room

SHANE
And the Captain
(beat )
Ill pull the car around front and
meet you

He happens to look down Notices Richards shoelace is untied

Gestures to it

RICHARD
What Oh Thank you

Richard kneels and ties his lace as Shane strolls away

Shane takes a set of keys off the vehicle board and pushes
through the double doors to the parking structure

A clock above the doors shows 915am

EXT 17TH PRECINCT - DAY

Richards waiting as Shane pulls up at the foot of the station

INT SHANES PATROL CAR (MOVING) - DAY
Shane scrolls through the incident reports listed on the laptop

RICHARD
Was she joking about lunch

SHANE
Lynsky Joke

Richard cracks a smile

SHANE (CONTD)
Noon till one set your watch by it

He glances at the dashboard clock
Richard gazes out at the street

STREET PEOPLE Borrowed shopping carts loaded with their
worldly possessions Drifting like third-world refugees

RICHARD
I dont imagine this is the most
popular job
(off Shanes frown)
Ride-alongs I hope you didnt get
the messy end of the stick

CUT TO

ALL TERRAIN TIRES ROLLING ACROSS DRY RUTTED MUD

INT SUV - DAY

THE CITY GIRL lies face down on the back seat Hands tied
Blindfolded

A severe jolt jars her awake Her panic heard in the way her
breath catches

IMAGES glimpsed from her POV -- a thin thread of light
penetrates beneath the blindfold the sky A derelict building

-- the SUV pulls inside the building
And seconds later the daylight vanishes

CUT TO

EXT CITY STREETS - DAY
Shanes black and white cruises past

RICHARD (0OS)
Do you ever get scared

INT SHANES PATROL CAR (MOVING) - DAY
SHANE
First times by yourself after youve
been with your TO -- Training

Officer But what they drill into
you at the academy Its there A
lots gauging the situation trying
to think three or four steps ahead
A rancid HOOKER plagues a corner seeking early morning wood

Shane slows enough for her to get the message and move on

RICHARD
You make it sound like chess

SHANE
It is You play

A nod from Richard

RICHARD
Openings always interesting
SHANE
For me its the endgame Im trying

to teach my girlfriend

RICHARD
Then you should tell her your first
moves determine the outcome Else
youre always playing catch up

They drive in silence for a moment

SHANE
Your detective the guy in your story

RICHARD
My protagonist

SHANE
Whats he like I mean how do you
do that

RICHARD
Im still working out what makes him
tick

SHANE

Sounds like a challenge

RICHARD
Every time Avoiding clichés the
policeman whose marriage is on the
rocks

SHANE
Not all cops are divorced

RICHARD
Thats my point But it cant be
easy that relationship

SHANE
People manage

RICHARD
Of course Nothing more important
than love and honor I wouldve

done anything for my wife --

Ahead a cheaply modified Acura is beached its front tire
pancake flat

A YOUTH steps out Looks totally pissed off His day complete
when he sees the approaching cop car

Shane blips the siren and pulls to the side of the road
SHANE
You want to wait on the sidewalk
EXT STREET - MINUTES LATER

Richard hangs near the patrol car while Shane talks to the
Acura driver Although we cant hear whats said from this
distance the conversation appears benign

Richard sees a couple of PASSENGERS inside the car

Shane walks back while radioing in We catch the tail end of
the transmission

SHANE
(into mic)
Ramirez Carlos G 486a Dove Street

He pops the trunk Its crammed with supplies First aid kit
Flares Duct tape Tool box

He lifts out a wheel jack

SHANE (CONTD)
You okay

RICHARD
Yes

DISPATCH (over radio)
Two-one No warrants but his parole
officer logged a failure to appear

SHANE
(into mic)

Richard notes the furtive looks the driver RAMIREZ keeps
giving Shane

RICHARD
What will you do

SHANE
Give him a warning Tell him to
check in with his PO today
Carrying the jack he walks back to the Acura

Richard returns to the patrol car to wait

EXT ACURA - DAY

As Shane approaches the driver leans inside Speaks to his
passengers HIS GIRLFRIEND and a guy in his early-20s

SHANE
Sir

Shane eases the jack to his left hand Rests his right on his
holstered gun

SHANE (CONTD)
Keep away from the car

Ramirez saunters a couple of steps -- suddenly breaks into a
run
THE PASSENGER DOOR FLIES OPEN -- and the passenger bolts too

Both men sprinting toward a narrow service alley

Shane drops the jack Takes off after them keys his radio --
SHANE (CONTD)
(into mic)
Two-one --

The girlfriend leaps out of the car --
She pounces onto Shanes back Clawing at his face
Shane spins like a dervish

The girl clings on until he performs a jujitsu throw she
hits the pavement

He snaps a pair of cuffs on her wrists She moans incoherently

INT SHANES PATROL CAR - DAY
Richard watches the stunning speed of events
Sees the suspects sprint into the alley

Sees Shane rush across the sidewalk then hesitate edging
closer to the entrance

EXT NARROW ALLEY - DAY

Graffiti-tagged walls Strewn trash Garbage cans and
dumpsters overflowing

RAPID FOOTSTEPS echo

Shane cautiously checks the alley glimpses Ramirez cutting
left down another alley No sign of the passenger

Shane steps forward Gun sweeping Takes a few cautious steps
He reaches for his radio --

BEHIND HIS BACK --

The passenger ERUPTS from his hiding place Wields a knife --
Shane spins around the blade flashes past his face Shane
stumbles backward off balance falls his gun clattering
on the ground

He scrambles for it

PASSENGER
CARLOS

At that same moment RICHARD --

-- steps into the alley He looks scared Grips the police
issue shotgun RACKS THE WEAPON with a loud KRRRACK

The passenger freezes
Shane snatches his gun off the ground --
BANG

The shot fired from down the alley by Ramirez BLASTS the
wall Misses Shane by inches

Shane torques around rapid fires BLAM-BLAM-BLAM

Ramirez jack-hammered off his feet Sent crashing into the
garbage cans His torso torn apart

Shane arcs his gun around in one continuous motion --
The passenger tosses his knife aside like its molten metal

AN INSTANT LATER -- the passenger is slammed to the ground by
Shane His hands cuffed tight behind his back

RAMIREZ
lying in the trash Bled out Dead

POLICE RADIO CHATTER OVERLAPS --

EXT STREET - MINUTES LATER
Patrol cars logjam the street

A cop pulls the girlfriend to her feet She spouts a tirade
of Spanish obscenities as the cop drags her away

EXT NARROW ALLEY - DAY
Shane and a number of OFFICERS linger near the body

SGT CAULDER (0S)
Who the hell went to war

Sgt Caulder strides toward them He casts his gaze Stunned
to see Shane in the middle of this chaos holding the 12 gauge

The CORONER arrives carrying a body bag that needs filling
EXT STREET - DAY

Shane gets some air We see it in his eyes Hes shaken but

keeping it together He walks over to Richard

SHANE
I owe you How you doing

RICHARD
Im okay Might need to change
my boxers

SHANE

Yeah I shouldve put some spare
pairs in the car

Caulder marches out of the alley Approaches Shane

SGT CAULDER
I want you gone before any cameras
show Phil can handle the press
Dont talk to anyone We clear
(turns to Richard)
Going to need your statement too

Richard nods yes of course

SGT CAULDER (CONTD)
(to Shane)
Ill see you in the room

INT SHANES PATROL CAR - DAY

Shane locks the shotgun back in its cradle as Richard climbs

in the passenger seat

INT SHANES PATROL CAR (MOVING) - DAY
Back on the streets Police radio at low volume

SHANE
You make your statement Tell them
what you saw Youre okay You
didnt fire a shot No ones going
to blame you for what went down

Shane stares out the windshield wondering how this will play

out for him Theyre near the 17th
Richard bends down to retie his shoelace

SHANE (CONTD)
Time to face the music

Thats when he feels the cold barrel of a gun against his neck
RICHARD
Time for that later

Shane doesnt move Doesnt twitch
RICHARD (CONTD)
Good Keep them on the wheel
(beat )
Dont slow down

Shane eases back on the gas and they pass the entrance to the
parking structure

Richard holds a compact pistol No sign of nerves now

Shane risks turning his head a fraction Chilled by the
calculating look in Richards eyes

SHANE
Hey lets just --

RICHARD
What Relax Officer Gideon do I
look stressed
He calmly removes a pair of cuffs from Shanes belt

CLICK

Richard snaps one loop around Shanes right hand Cuffs him
to the steering wheel

SHANE

Wait how am I supposed to --
RICHARD

Ah Quiet turn right

He removes Shanes service weapon from its holster

RICHARD (CONTD)
You carry another weapon

SHANE
No

Shane manages to negotiate the turn
RICHARD
Fair enough But if I see you reach

I wont ask again

SHANE
I said no

RICHARD
And you wouldnt lie to me
(no reply)
Your cell
A beat
SHANE

Top pocket

Richard dips his hand into Shanes shirt pocket Removes
Shanes cell Tosses it out the window --

SHANE (CONTD)
What are you doing

Richard doesnt bother to reply Instead he switches off the
radio Rips the wires out the back of the laptop

ON THE SCREEN - the error message LOST NETWORK CONNECTION
RICHARD
Keep driving around the block
(checks the time)
We have a few minutes to kill

Tight-lipped Shane does as hes told His eyes scan the
dashboard his mind racing --

He glances outside -- sees a BEAT COP
The cop flashes a hand-sign to Shane Four fingers

RICHARD (CONTD)
Were copacetic

Shane hesitates then signals the same everythings good
Richard types on his cell phones display
Opens a VIDEO FILE as Shane takes the next turn

RICHARD (CONTD)
Pull in Here

Shane stops the car

Richard holds up the phone so Shane can see the display

INSERT PHONE DISPLAY —-
BULLETS being loaded into a magazine

The mags slotted into a lethal COLT PISTOL

INTERCUT WITH SHANE AS NEEDED
A SOLID CLACK as the first rounds chambered

Someone picks up the weapon The viewpoint shifts Comes to
rest --

ULTRA-TIGHT on a womans mouth --
The next moment THE GUNS FORCED BETWEEN HER TEETH

The camera wavers then moves back revealing the womans
terrified face A woman we recognize

Shes the young woman who was snatched off the street
Dry tear tracks streak her cheeks

SHANE
Alicia

His girlfriend stares into the camera Her eyes pleading

SHANE (CONTD)
NO

Shane yanks on the cuffs A desperate futile attempt Lunging
and twisting trying to strike at Richard --

Richard reacts with inhuman speed Blocks the ineffective blow --
He slams Shanes head forward against the steering wheel

His gun instantly in Shanes face

RICHARD
Do I have your attention Officer
Gideon
Shanes heart pounds He stares into the gun barrel only an

inch from his eye

RICHARD (CONTD)
Your undivided attention

Richard releases his hold on Shane

RICHARD (CONTD)
Drive

CUT TO

INT CLOSET - DAY
ALICIAS wrists and ankles are bound tight to a wooden chair
Her red-rimmed eyes plead Helpless
She chokes back a plaintive sob

The SUV driver dispassionately lowers the camera pointed at
her

Alicia strains against her bonds Twisting her wrists trying
to work them free only she cant

Her eyes go wide when she sees him pick up an ugly SandM ball
gag

He approaches

ALICIA
Please -- dont

He pushes the gag hard and deep into her mouth She struggles
not to choke

The man turns his back on her and walks out Closing the door
with the ominous finality of a coffin lid

Leaving Alicia in the dark Alone

CUT TO

INT SHANES PATROL CAR (MOVING) - DAY
Richard pockets his cell

SHANE

blame but yourself

in a quiet corridor Their voices low

INT SHANES PATROL CAR (MOVING) - DAY
Shane stares at Richard as if hes certifiable

SHANE
You want to go back to the precinct

A frown corrugates Shanes brow cant figure this guy out
Richard ignores the question He holds up Shanes gun
RICHARD
I believe they might ask you for
this
He calmly places the loaded gun back into Shanes holster

RICHARD (CONTD)
I suggest you resist any temptations

He slides his own weapon into a concealed ankle holster before
removing it and tucking it beneath the passenger seat
Ahead lies the 17th

RICHARD (CONTD)
I need to make a phone call in exactly
one hour If I dont well how
creatives your imagination

Richard takes the handcuff key from Shanes belt
unlock the cuffs

RICHARD (CONTD)

When we get inside your minds going
to be screaming to warn somebody to
tell them whats happening But you
dont want to sacrifice your queen
do you

(pause)
For her sake I suggest you control
your impulses

Shane ratchets down his emotions

SHANE

Richard takes a MEMORY STICK from his pocket The storage
device is readily identifiable by an embossed silver logo

RICHARD
Less than ten hours and this is all
over Ill be satisfied and youll
have a story to tell the grandkids

be the wrong side of dead

He hands it to Shane

RICHARD (CONTD)
All you have to do is swap them

RICHARD
It was my fault

Richard looks queasy He rubs his stomach as if fighting a
bout of nausea

OFFICER SANCHEZ

(to Shane)
Come on

They continue down the corridor Officer Sanchez leads the
way

Shane slows fractionally as they pass the Evidence Room

Richard nudges him subtly the meaning clear -- keep moving

A moment longer then the matronly Evidence Officer Lynsky
steps out presumably heading to lunch

He glances toward interview room 2 --

The door remains closed

Shane runs his fingers through his hair Perspiration moistens
his upper lip

His agitations not lost on Sgt Caulder
SGT CAULDER
You just charged into the alley

SHANE
I already told you what --

SGT CAULDER
Yeah I guess that makes you a hero
He slides his chair back legs scraping like nails ona
chalkboard

SGT CAULDER (CONTD)
Be back here in five boot

With that he marches out taking Shanes gun with him

Shane glances at the wall clock Times ticking

INT PRECINCT LOBBY - DAY
Richard fills a fresh cup from the cooler
His eyes wander over the fugitives faces on the Wanted Board

Middle Eastern countenances predominate The enigmatic threat
of terror demoting child molesters serial killers and sundry
criminals to the foot of the board

One of the faces momentarily catches Richards attention a
half-moon scar arcs across the mans cheek

Richard sips his water and moves on

INT CAPTAINS OFFICE - DAY

Tom Barnes sits behind a monolithic desk thats witnessed the
passing of a dozen predecessors

He looks up when Sgt Caulder pokes his head inside the door
Tom beckons him to a chair
Caulder enters but doesnt sit

CAPTAIN BARNES
Problem

SGT CAULDER
Im trying real hard to picture Gideon
solo with that result

CAPTAIN BARNES
Maybe what happened before maybe
that taught him what he needed today

SGT CAULDER
(no way)
Maybe

A KNOCK at the door

CAPTAIN BARNES

A CLERK carries in a clipboard and transcript papers She
hands them to the Captain

CAPTAIN BARNES (CONTD)

INT INTERVIEW ROOM 2 - DAY

No sign of Shane The rooms empty

INT CORRIDOR OUTSIDE CAPTAINS OFFICE - DAY
The nearby briefing room door stands ajar
The clerk ambles past heels CLICK-CLACKING down the hall

Shanes eye appears Hes inside the briefing room staring
through the crack Watching the Captains office door

Tom and Caulder walk out concluding their discussion

CAPTAIN BARNES
- what he has to say

Shane watches them leave Waits a beat then emerges

A couple of UNIFORMS standing around at the far end of the
corridor -- too busy jawing to notice Shane

He moves swiftly to the Captains door Tries the handle
Its not locked

INT CAPTAINS OFFICE - DAY
Shane steps inside Hurries over to the massive desk
Searches the drawers

Removes the set of keys he finds there -- its a keychain with
a laser-pointer and half a dozen keys

INSERT - A DOOR OPENING

INT INTERVIEW ROOM 1 - DAY
- Tom Barnes steps into the room holding the transcript

Richard sits quietly A picture of virtue and patience

Tom lays the clipboard and a pen on the table
CAPTAIN BARNES

If you could make sure its correct
Initial any errors or changes

EXT CORRIDOR OUTSIDE EVIDENCE ROOM - DAY
As Shane nears the door Officer Watkins strolls toward him

OFFICER WATKINS
Yo Gideon

Shane offers a nod of acknowledgment Surprised that Watkins
addressed him

OFFICER WATKINS (CONTD)
Heard what went down Thats solid

SHANE
Thanks

Watkins continues past

Shane takes a breath Stops outside the evidence room Then
keys the security code

INT EVIDENCE ROOM - UNSECURED AREA - DAY
The lock BUZZES and Shane enters the unoccupied room

He takes out the stolen key and approaches the inner door

INT INTERVIEW ROOM 1 - DAY
1245pm on the clock
Richard reads the transcript Hes in no hurry

Captain Barnes waits patiently

INT EVIDENCE ROOM —- DAY

Shane scours the crammed shelves Various items with seemingly
little connection to any conceivable crime

A couple of high-end laptops are stacked in one corner Shane
confines his search to this area

Hard disc drives sealed in Ziploc bags

Shane pushes these aside Snatches down a cardboard box labeled
USBs

He flicks through half a dozen small clear packets Inside
each is a memory stick

INT INDOOR PISTOL RANGE - DAY

Evidence Officer Lynsky holsters her gun She walks out with
the other policewoman both looking pleased with themselves --

Leaving behind two emasculated paper targets

INT EVIDENCE ROOM - DAY

Shane snatches a distinctive stick from the box Its a match
for the one Richard gave him -- only this one has a smear of
dry blood on the plastic casing

Shane peels open the bag Swaps the sticks Shoves the genuine
article in his pocket then returns the box to the shelf

He turns -- coming face-to-face with the wall of weapons which
have been entered into evidence

A compact Glock catches his eye But a trigger guard is secured
in place rendering this like the other weapons worthless

Shane glances at his watch Shit

He hurries Searches the shelves for something he might use --

INT CORRIDOR - DAY

Officer Lynsky strolls down the corridor

INT EVIDENCE ROOM —- DAY
Shane stops abruptly
He moves to the door Listens Then inches it open --

stares at the door as Shane steps into the room

SHANE

MAHONE
So whatre you doing

SHANE

Shane holds out the Captains keys as if thats proof

MAHONE

Shanes reply is a second too long in coming

MAHONE (CONTD)
Bullshit

A standoff The two cops eye-to-eye Shane running out of
time and options

MAHONE (CONTD)
Whatre you doing Gid --

THWACK

A roundhouse punch Shanes fist slams into Mahones jaw
Mahone lurches backward stunned --

Shane swings again Mahone able to partially block the blow

The two cops grapple A down-n-dirty flurry of limbs as Mahone
kicks at Shane and Shane gets in a couple of blows --

OOF

The air sucked from Shanes lungs as Mahone delivers a sucker
punch --

Shane goes down takes Mahones legs out from under him --
MAHONE (CONTD)
(yelling for help)
HEY
He hits the floor --

Shanes on him Grabbing the Taser from Mahones belt

MAHONE (CONTD)
HEY --

Shane rolls clear FIRES

Ozone crackles Mahone spasms -- knocking the Taser from
Shanes grasp

Mahone lies motionless Stunned Manages a weak groan
Shane snatches a roll of parcel tape off the workbench

He unceremoniously wraps the tape tight around Mahones head
Covering his mouth to shut him up

Relieving Mahone of his handcuffs Shane secures the cops
hands Keeps the second pair Drags Mahone into

THE SECURE AREA

Shane dumps him there And exits

HOLD ON MAHONE

His face and ego equally bruised

INT EVIDENCE ROOM - UNSECURED AREA - DAY
Shane locks the inner door just as --
BZZZZZT -- someone unlocks the door from the corridor

Shoving the Captains keychain into his pocket Shane steps to
the workbench Kicks the Taser underneath and out of sight

Officer Lynsky enters --

Shane drops the knife into an evidence bag glances casually
over his shoulder

Lynsky eyes his disheveled uniform

EVIDENCE OFFICER
You all right

SHANE
Im fine

Lynsky steps past him her keys rattling as she reaches the
inner door --

SHANE (CONTD)
Did Caulder find you
EVIDENCE OFFICER
What

SHANE
He came looking for you a minute ago

EVIDENCE OFFICER
Why

SHANE
(shrugs no clue)
Youre wanted upstairs All I know
Cussing to herself Lynsky heads back the way she came

Shane breathes again as the door shuts

He rips open the bag Takes the knife

INT INTERVIEW ROOM 1 - DAY

Richard checks the clock Then skims through the remaining
pages of the transcript Uncaps his pen

A touch of irritation flickers on Tom Barness face
CAPTAIN BARNES
So long as youre sure its correct

Richard looks up

RICHARD
No mistakes

He signs on the dotted line with a flourish

INT CORRIDOR OUTSIDE INTERVIEW ROOMS - DAY

INT CLOSET - DAY
The SUV driver advances on Alicia

She struggles Her eyes beseeching Desperate for this
nightmare to end

The man tugs the ball-gag from her mouth
He grips her pinkie finger --

Alicia CRIES OUT as he levers it back hard against the joint
The slightest increase in pressure and her finger will break

INT CLOSET - DAY

The ball-gag is wedged harshly back into Alicias mouth
Her eyes swim with pain

The SUV driver exits the room

As he opens the door we hear the buzz of a generator and
glimpse --

-- inside some kind of factory illuminated by sparse pools of
artificial light

Theres a carbon black HUMVEE parked inside the building

An original hard-core Hummer not some wanna-be -- in fact its
an ex-military vehicle

Nearby a guy with a severe crewcut is field stripping a potent
-50 cal rifle His names YORK and hes built like a brick
shit house
He glances in Alicias direction as the closet door swings
Blows her a kiss

INT SHANES PATROL CAR - DAY
Shane silent Impotent
Richard takes back the phone Clamshells it shut
RICHARD
You cost me five minutes Thats
something I can not abide and she

can not afford

Richard opens the cars laptop -- its still working even
though its disconnected from the outside world

He pushes the memory stick into an empty USB port

RICHARD (CONTD)
Lets see

The screen blanks to a system window Cursor flashing
NO FILES FOUND

Richard checks his cell phones display -- on it is a text
message to access a hidden file

He types the same message into the computer Hits enter

A MAP OF THE CITY appears on the monitor

Lucky you had an angel watching over
you

From his vantage point Richard has a limited view of the alley
He sees Ramirez fleeing -- but no sign of the passenger

Shane notices a line of parked vehicles His mind racing --

Suddenly he floors the gas swerves toward the parked cars

Richards hands fly up instinctively to protect his face --

Shane wrenches the wheel at the last possible instant sends
them skidding sideways into a parked Jaguar

Richards side of the car takes the full IMPACT The door
pillar buckles with a horrendous SCREECH

AIRBAGS POP

The windshield cracks Richards window SHATTERS Granules
of glass shower over him

The car rocks heavily on its suspension

RICHARDS HEAD SLAMS against the damaged door knocking him
unconscious

SILENCE
That momentary stillness in the wake of an accident

Shaken Shane looks at Richard Sees the shallow rise and
fall of the mans chest Hes still alive

Shane strains to reach Richards gun He tugs hard on the
cuffs -- but theres no way he can stretch that far while
secured to the wheel

Using his left hand Shane searches Richards pockets --
-- finds Richards cell phone

A beat Then Shane flips it open
