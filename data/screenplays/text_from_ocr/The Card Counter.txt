INCARCERATION

INT CASINO - MORNING 1

EXTREME SLOW MOTION CLOSEUPS of a dealer’s hand shuffling
cards from a shoe onto a blackjack table The cards fall
hypnotically into place

A dry measured voice speaks over

TELL VO
I had never imagined myself as
someone suited to a life of
incarceration As a boy I was
afraid of confined spaces I feared
elevators When I was older I just
wanted to get in the car roll the
windows and drive drive Drive
wherever my eyes would take me I
was an American kid

Close ups players’ hands checking cards

TELL VO (CONTD)
Confinement of any kind was
terrifying to me

Close up Dealer’s hand re-deals

TELL VO (CONTD)
So to my surprise having been
sentenced to ten years in prison I
found I adjusted quite well

--prisoners dressed in matching prison issue browns sit at

utensils Conversation is minimal Correction Specialists”
stand watch

--WILLIAM TELL 32 lies on a hard bed in his Spartan 6x9

He stares upward a folded library book on his stomach

Pink Rev 2

Prisoners set down meal trays on four seat tables in the
cellblock common area Tell’s voice-over continues

TELL VO
I liked the routine I liked the
regimen The same activities the
same time every day The same
toothbrush the same clothes the
same toilet the same food the
same flip-flops the same
conversations The faces change
but not much No choices No
anxiety

Lights out

TELL VO (CONTD)
I found that I liked reading books
Id never read a book before Not
all the way through I found a life
for myself that had been beyond my
imagination

--Tell sits on his bunk dealing placing cards from a deck on
to the blanket One by one He concentrates on each

TELL VO (CONTD)
It was in prison I learned to count

CASHING OUT
INT CASINO - DAY 3

William Tell 42 sits at a Blackjack table in some casino
any casino anywhere Three other players He has a good
stack of chips The Blackjack Dealer deals

He wears a grey button shirt narrow black tie and loose
greygreen jacket His hair is center parted

TELL VO
What separates Blackjack from other
games is that it’s based on
dependent events meaning past
affects the probability in the
future The house has a 15 percent
advantage

(MORE )
TELL VO (CONTD)
If a player knows the nature of the
cards in the shoe he can turn the
house advantage to himself To do
this he has to keep track of every
card that is played

Editing illustrates the points Tell is making

TELL VO (CONTD)

The count is based on a high low
system High cards ten jack
queen king have a value of minus
one If they are depleted players
advantage goes down The low cards
two three four five six have a
value of plus one The seven eight
and nine have no count value The
player keeps track of every card
and calculates the running count

The Dealer distributes cards from the shoe The value of each
card is labeled by a “1” or “-1 that graphic on screen as
is the ever changing total plus or minus running count value

TELL VO (CONTD)
Then the player arrives at the true
count which is the running count
divided by the decks remaining For
example if the running count is
plus nine and there are four and a
half decks remaining nine over
four and a half gives you a true
count of plus two As true count
increases the player’s advantage
increases The idea is to bet
little when you don’t have the
advantage and proportionately more
when you do

William collects his winnings The Dealer looks at Tell
signals with his eyes the Pit Boss is watching

TELL
Well that’s about enough for me

Tell stacks his chips stands Says to the other players

TELL (CONTD)
Nice playing with you

He tips the Dealer and heads for the cashiers’ cages The Pit
Boss watches as he goes

Pink Rev 15

GORDO (CONTD)
The instrument typically used to
conduct polygraph tests consists of
a physiological recorder that
assesses three indicators of
autonomic arousal heart rateblood
pressure respiration and skin
conductivity Specific incident
testing The cumulative research
evidence suggests that CQTs detect
deception better than chance but
with significant error rates both
of misclassifying innocent subjects
(false positives) and failing to
detect guilty individuals (false
negatives) 1991 The Supreme Court
again rejected the use of polygraph
tests as evidence

This may soon change Vocat

which uses a proprietary
algorithm to interact with CQT

STABL is in the Beta testing
phase Vocat will soon be offering
a test version of this software to

Vocat makes no great claims but it
feels this advance in “possible”
truth detection needs some field
experience How reliable is it How
does it work That’s what I want to
get into next

drift” It happens when the
interrogator applies more and more
force to the prisoner with less and

becomes intoxicated by frustration

force without reason Without
result Any man can tilt I can

Who goes first

The camera incrementally retreats Muted sounds are heard
periodically off screen GRUNTS THUDS YELPS

NIGHT TURNS TO DAY The camera comes to a stop Waits

Tell emerges from the unseen room His shirt is soaked with
blood There are bloody knife slashes on his left thigh His
shoes leave bloody footprints A green sandbag hood hangs
from his right hand

His arms his face are covered with bleeding gashes The
fingers on his left hand are twisted and broken The sandbag
falls to the carpet

He steps over to a table struggles to picks up a land line
receiver with his left hand Dials 911 with the right

911 Where is your emergency

Emergency services

Id like to report a homicide

FADE TO BLACK

someone suited to a life of
incarceration
A GUARD calls his name

INT LEAVENWORTH PRISON HALLWAY - DAY 86
TIMECUT Tell is led down a corridor to the visitation area

CUT TO

INT LEAVENWORTH PRISON VISITATION - CONTINUOUS 87
The Guard ushers him into a cubicle

And there stands La Linda Dressed in red

She smiles She reaches out her hand

Seen from a side view her finger touches the glass just
before his finger joins hers

Just like the Sistine ceiling
