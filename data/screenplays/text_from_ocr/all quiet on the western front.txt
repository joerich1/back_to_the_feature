Based on the novel

by Erich Maria Remarque
EXT WOODS FRANCE 1917 - DAWN 1

Softly LAPPING WATER A creek running over roots grass
swaying in the stream Ferns softly RUSTLE in the wind

THUMP A pine cone falls on the ground Another one And
another one

A peaceful mild spring morning Peaceful LOW RUMBLE OF
THUNDER in the distance Its very quiet Too quiet

INTERCUT WITH

INT FOX DEN - DAY 2

A narrow shaft of light falls into the fox den from the
entrance of the tunnel The dirt is damp And a soft noise

SCRATCHING SMACKING SOFT WHIMPERS

The vixen feeds her young who greedily suckle at her teats
The twigs and berries beside them

Then we hear it again A distant RUMBLE OF THUNDER followed
by a noticeable TREMOR A little dirt trickles from the
ceiling Light falls on the young family like a painting of
the Madonna

The vixen ignores it wholly absorbed by her litter She
licks their fur and lets them suckle Its soft and fuzzy and
full of love

- when suddenly A SHORT SHARP SHRILL tone
BOOOOM The world explodes Everything goes BLACK The fox
den has ceased to exist
EXT LATIERRE TRENCH - DAY 3

A trench -- about 8 feet deep Walls of earth and clay The
bottom is mud and dirt

THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP

Deafening NOISE A hellish barrage of gunfire Metal shrapnel
perforates the wood posts like butter

Hundreds of shells explode around the GERMAN SOLDIERS
hurling piles of dirt into the air Ruthless Destructive
Random

We pan over dozens of bodies Young SOLDIERS lying in the
dirt hugging the walls of the trench

They hope against hope they will survive the next seconds
Thats all its ever about Surviving the next seconds

BOOM A DIRECT HIT

The trench explodes in a cloud of dirt smoke and death
Bodies fly through the air landing in the reeking water
Over the SCREAMS of the wounded -- amid a crescendo of noise

and chaos -- we hear barked orders across the front lines

SERGEANT (0S)
ATTACK ATTACK

ANGLE ON the frightened face of a SOLDIER HEINRICH GERBER --
no older than 18 His hands clutch a rifle his knuckles
stand out white as a ghost his bayonet is mounted

The SERGEANT appears drags Gerber to the ladder

SERGEANT (CONTD)
Come on Heinrich Lets go

BOOM A shell hits the trench Soldiers hurry by

SERGEANT (CONTD)
On my orders Charge

A shrill WHISTLE and WAR CRY arises along the front line A
young 16-YEAR-OLD RECRUIT looks at him trembling
Heinrich nods at him

HEINRICH GERBER
Itll be OK

Before we can catch our breath HEINRICH climbs up the ladder
behind the RECRUIT out of the German trench right into the
MG barrage whipping at them from the French lines

RAT TAT TAT TAT TAT

The RECRUIT and a dozen other men are hit and hurled back
into the trench like dominos

Heinrich stands at the top of the ladder Trembling he turns
around to see the young RECRUIT bleeding to death in the mud
shot in the head

SOLDIERS (0S)
Keep going

SERGEANT
Go on Gerber Go

The next wave of Soldiers throngs up from below forcing
Heinrich up the ladder onto the the roiling battlefield The
Sergeant drives him onward

SERGEANT (CONTD)
Go go go

( )
Goldenrod Revision 2242021 3 3

Heinrich fights his way through the heavy mud which sucks at
his boots and slows him down Past the tentacles of barbed
wire in which disfigured bodies hang

BOOM A shell hits a few yards off hurling dirt and mud over
us Heinrich keeps on running

He staggers and runs bowing low shitting bricks He fights
against overwhelming nausea as shells blow new craters around
us A No Mans Land of death and madness pocked with craters
like the moon

Heinrich runs ducking low his bayonet in his hand
searching for cover where there is none as his FELLOW
SOLDIERS are fall in a hail of bullets

He ducks behind a blasted tree stump tries to catch his
breath

SERGEANT (0S) (CONTD)
Gerber Gerber

The Sergeants voice reaches us weakly through the BATTLE
NOISES The NCO lies in the mud hit reaching his arms out
toward us imploringly

Heinrich crawls back toward him

He reaches his hand out to him and drags him along but then
MG FIRE riddles the ground first the tree stump and then
hits the wounded Sergeant in the cheek

Blood spatters in Heinrichs face He fights back his panic
while theres a WHISTLE behind him as the second wave of
GERMAN SOLDIERS charges out of the trench

BANG BANG BANG CLICK Heinrich empties his clip and drops
his bayonet He desperately grabs a trench shovel summoning
all his courage

He charges at the enemy trench SCREAMING from where
HUNDREDS OF FRENCHMEN charge at us with bayonets out

Heinrich raises his shovel PANTING Unleashes a primeval WAR
CRY Like a wild animal

The enemy comes closer and closer Then Heinrich STRIKES
Right at his enemys neck

WHACK

SMASH TO BLACK

The gang of friends heads for the staircase where the truck
is parked at the cargo ramp The veteran is unloading the
uniforms with two other soldiers

INT SCHOOL STRAIRS - DAY 14

A big staircase The STUDENTS crowd the steps Paul and his
three buddies among them holding their marching orders to
the front lines a sense of grand adventure on their faces
They cant wait to become soldiers

The teachers stand at the back in the hall looking proud
The PRINICIPAL stands on the top flight a short wiry
guy with a big handlebar mustache giving a fiery speech

PRINCIPAL
You stand on the threshold to
becoming men This is a moment you
will always remember Its a great
moment by which you will be judged
for the rest of your life what you
have dared to become today the
Iron Youth of Germany

The Principal scans the young mens faces From the corner of
his eye he sees two pupils shoving each other around

PRINCIPAL (CONTD)

My dear boys Were fortunate to
life in such a great time Your
deeds will form the ground water
for a strong new root to grow
carrying the flowers and fruits of
a glorious future

(to the two quarreling

kids)

They clutch their hands to their mouth and nose against the
smell of carbolic and gangrene Behm stares at the injured
Paul drags him off

PAUL

He looks around for reassurance from a NURSE kneeling among
the wounded soldiers

Lt Hoppe grabs a dismounting recruitss bayonet -- the blade
is saw-toothed on the blunt side

What the hell is this Soldier

RECRUIT FIELD HOSPITAL
A bayonet Lieutenant Sir

LIEUTENANT HOPPE

This is a saw blade Soldier If

these they will mutilate you
First they will saw your nose off
Then they will gouge your eyes out
And they they will stuff your
throat with sawdust so you slowly
suffocate

The recruit stares at him in shock Hoppe gives the bayonet

blade

front Clay sticks to their boots a dead dog lies in their
path

Lt Hoppe eggs them on

LIEUTENANT HOPPE
Step lively Soldier Dont fall

hit the dirt Hoppe SCREAMS at them

LIEUTENANT HOPPE (CONTD)
Gas Gas Gas

The recruits frantically get up and dig out their gas masks
While most of them are still struggling with their satchels
Hoppe already has his mask on and fastened

The Lieutenant marches along his squad his voice muffled by
his gas mask Hes using the forced march for a drill

LIEUTENANT HOPPE (CONTD)
Gentlemen that was what you calla
Fat pig If the Frogs could aim
theyd be scratching us off the
road with a spatula and burying us
in a mess kit But one thing is as

last to put it on

LIEUTENANT HOPPE (CONTD)
Poison gas shells come in groups of
three and land with a dull thud So
if you see someone putting on their
mask put on yours Youve got six
seconds before you start spitting
clots of blood the size of beets
back home on the farm

Lt Hoppe stops before Paul Very calmly he watches the
young recruit still struggling with his gas mask

LIEUTENANT HOPPE (CONTD)
Eyes front

The recruits snap to and look straight ahead -- except Paul
who frantically wedges his gas mask between his knees trying
to adjust the leather straps

Hoppes glasses fog up a first drop of rain falls on them
His ominous breathing behind the mask In Out In Out A
bit like Darth Vader

Paul finally got it on He puts the mask on and looks
straight ahead

LIEUTENANT HOPPE (CONTD)
Are you deaf man

PAUL
No Lieutenant Sir I was just
trying to put my mask on

Hoppe eyes him for a beat Then

LIEUTENANT HOPPE
Youre almost certainly gonna be
dead by dawn boy You better have
something to eat

Paul swallows the insult Hoppe takes his mask off and turns
to the squad

LIEUTENANT HOPPE (CONTD)
Attention Masks off Two abreast

an access trench to the front

Shells WHIZZ by A DRONE drowns everything out BOOM The
shell explodes

The young recruits duck Clumps of dirt pelt down on their
backs Hoppe waves them onward

LIEUTENANT HOPPE
Go Go

Bullets ZING over their heads MG FIRE RATTLES in the
distance WOUNDED MEN come toward them two SOLDIERS drag an
empty soup cauldron back from the front

Paul is in the back along with Miiller He has a hard time

EXT LATIERRE HILL TRENCH - DAY 29

Rain keeps beating down as SOLDIERS fire an MG RAT TAT TAT

backed up knee-high on the ground -- the RECRUITS wade
through it

They finally reach their unit at the front Gaunt ragged
hollow-eyed SOLDIERS mainly trying to keep dry Some try to
sleep They all look miserable

LIEUTENANT HOPPE
Congratulations Soldiers Welcome
to your new home

(to all)
Helmets off

The veterans GROAN They know what this means Groaning they
pick up buckets and start bailing out clay muddy water from
the trench Some of them have tied sandbags to the tops of
their boots to keep the water from running in

SERGEANT STEINBERGER appears to greet the Lieutenant

LIEUTENANT HOPPE (CONTD)
I see the men have been enjoying my
absence Steinberger

SGT STEINBERGER
Weve been under MG barrage all
night Their nerves are bare

LIEUTENANT HOPPE
Dry boots are a good remedy for
that
(to recruits)
Everyone pitch in bail out the
trench

The young recruits follow the veterans example and use their
helmets and food pails as bailing buckets You can see the
shock in their faces the gleam in their eyes is gone
Tiredly they bail water out of the trench Constant
COUGHING

Lt Hoppe turns on his heel and disappears in his bunker In
passing he yanks the gas mask off Pauls face and presses it
hard against his chest

LIEUTENANT HOPPE (CONTD)
What are you waiting for

He leaves him standing there disappears inside

Paul WHEEZES and gasps for air Even if its raining the
fresh air is good for him

Suddenly a figure emerges from a shelter and offers him an
open canteen Paul looks up SNORTING staring straight at
STANISLAUS KATCZINSKY

KAT is 40 and still a Private which says a lot about him
Tough sly smart with a dirty face with blue eyes
drooping shoulders and a good nose for danger and good food
where there usually isnt Hes a shoemaker in real life In
which he has a sixth sense Hes the secret commander of the
company

KAT
Give a dog a piece of meat and it
will always snap at it Give a
person power

He shrugs chewing tobacco in his mouth

KAT (CONTD)
Man is a beast drink

Paul gratefully accepts the canteen He drinks Finally he
wipes his mouth off

( )

Goldenrod Revision 2242021 19 29

PAUL
Thanks

A silent nod then Kat screws his canteen shut BOOM A
fountain of mud shoots up nearby Kat looks up at the sky
longingly

KAT
Theres gonna be a blanket tonight

He turns and goes over to his comrades to help them bail
Paul gets up and goes out Kropp Miiller and Behm are in the
middle of it Behm is plagued by guilt over the gas mask

BEHM
Im sorry

PAUL
Forget it

BEHM
This isnt what I expected

KROPP
Oh shut up

In a row the men bail the cold muddy water out of the
trench occasionally GAGGING as they find feces in it A
VETERAN straightens up a support beam and presses it back
into the wall of the trench Another SOLDIER pulls off his
boots revealing his gangrenous feet

Behm starts bailing like crazy to make up for his mistake
Paul tries to calm him down

PAUL
Ludwig Ludwig Its okay

Behm suddenly pauses exhausted His fingers are red and
frozen

BEHM
My hands I cant feel my hands

KAT
Stick em in your drawers Thats
what I do

Behm wipes his hands off and sticks them in this underpants
Paul Miiller Kropp -- they all do the same thing It gets
better after a few seconds Their expressions are relieved

KAT (CONTD)
Like I said

They resume bailing Only Behm is still standing there with
his hands in his pants Kropp turns his nose up in disgust

Goldenrod Revision 2242021 20 29

KROPP
The water stinks

TJADEN

Thats the innards Of the dead
Fermentation agents you know Like
Bavarian beer Only that it tastes
like death

TJADEN STACKFLEET is an old hand despite his youth The
biggest eater of the company but skinny a peat digger by
trade

Paul and Kropp stare at him blankly Tjaden reaches for a
clump in the water beside them He lifts it up A soldiers
rotting CORPSE A last SIGH of gas escapes from the corpses
lungs forming a bubble in the water

Tjaden wordlessly drops the body and lets it sink into the
maw of the mud Kat turns to Paul and indicates the folding
trench shovel on his belt

KAT
Hey Gimme that

PAUL
What My shovel

KAT
Quick

Paul hands him the trench shovel Kat wades a few steps into
the water then rams it into the ground in a flash And
again

He digs in the mud for a beat then drags a dead rat out by
the tail He flings it out of the trench unmoved and starts
looking for the next cadaver

He finally hands the shovel back to Paul

KAT (CONTD)
You can split someones chest with
one of these but you really have
to hit him hard between the
shoulder and the neck right
here

Kat places the edge of his hand on Pauls neck Paul GULPS
he looks at the shovel in his hand unsure of himself Albert
Kropp whispers to them

KROPP
Like a butcher

EXT LATIERRE HILL TRENCH - NIGHT 30

The middle of the night Its still raining Its cold wet
and dirty A flare illuminates the battlefield strewn with
corpses

Paul and Kropp huddle in the trench their uniform collars
closed tight around their necks pulling guard duty

Kropps head sinks to his chest He has a carving knife and a
piece of wood on his lap -- hes fallen asleep over his
carving

Paul is polishing his rifle again then he listens up and
looks out at the deep darkness -- a RUSTLE in the dark He
nudges his friend

PAUL

Albert Kropp wakes up again
PAUL (CONTD)
Soldiers who fall asleep on guard

duty are court-martialed and shot

KROPP
Leave me alone

Kropp straightens up tiredly and watches Paul cleaning his
rifle

KROPP (CONTD)
You think it will shoot better that
way

Paul listens up There it is again The RUSTLE in the dark

PAUL
Did you hear that

KROPP

PAUL (CONTD)
Our first Frenchman

KROPP
Settle down

There it is again A soft RUSTLE not even ten yards away
Paul and Kropp exchange looks They both pale

KROPP (CONTD)
Now I heard it too

PAUL
(loud whisper)
Whos there

No answer The RUSTLING suddenly stops then resumes a few
seconds later Paul aims his rifle into the dark

A shadow flits by in the dark looking like a man

PAUL (CONTD)
(louder )
Halt who goes there
(in broken French)
Montrez-vous

Nothing The shadow crawls toward them

Paul SHOOTS The muzzle flash illuminates the night

Two rats the size of a loaf of bread skitter a few steps to
the side Their faces are bloody one of them has human
entrails dangling from its mouth

Suddenly -- CLANG A bullet hits Pauls helmet and knocks it
clean off his head Paul falls off the ladder and lands in a
puddle at the bottom of the trench

PAUL (CONTD)
Im hit Im hit

He frantically feels his face and head to see where hes hit
Then he inspects his helmet and discovers two bullet holes

PAUL (CONTD)
They shot me Twice

KROPP
Well there were two rats after
all

KAT (0S)
Who shot

Katczinsky comes out of the covered path and approaches up
the trench Paul shows him his bullet-riddled helmet

KAT

With one shot
Kat looks at the damage One entry hole one exit hole

KAT (CONTD)
They saw your muzzle flash Next
time dont stick your head out

He hands Paul back his helmet The boy dons it awkwardly and
returns to his original position

KAT (CONTD)
If you dont wanna catch the next
bullet with your teeth I suggest
you moved ten meters down the
trench

The two recruits stare at him

KAT (CONTD)
Shoot move shoot move Got it

Kat heads off shaking his head Paul and Kropp head along
the trench and take their positions again Paul reloads

Two FLARES are shot into the sky gliding down on parachutes
Paul and Kropp gape at the spectacle It would be beautiful
if it werent so deadly

We now have time to scan the battlefield A landscape pocked
by craters dark black dirt crisscrossed by barbed wired

Two FRENCHMEN looking for wounded in no mans land are
surprised by the bright flare Kropp raises his rifle and
aims Paul pushes his barrel down

PAUL
Those are medics

KROPP
So Theyre Frenchmen

A sudden throaty ROAR BOOM Just a few yards behind the
trench an artillery shell hits pelting them with dirt

BOOM BOOM Two more hits in quick sequence Katczinsky
hurries up

KAT

Paul and Albert stumble over to the bunker

The SOLDIERS sit in the bunker huddling tight Its dark
Earth and wood walls

Paul and Kropp find themselves a spot near Miiller and Behm
Kat and Tjaden are with them

Shells hit outside BOOM BOOM BOOM It doesnt stop The
recruits are in panic They shut their eyes shaking as the
veterans sit there stoically waiting for the end of the
barrage

Behm holds his ears shut sweating and and gasping for air

BEHM
You are what you eat My mother

Paul smiles Behm looks at him

BEHM (CONTD)
Well stick together Paul

PAUL
Yeah

A shell strikes nearby BOOM A roof beam breaks and
collapses sending dirt raining down on the soldiers

A desperate recruit pukes in a corner Ludwig Behm wants to
get up and flee but Paul is holding him back

PAUL (CONTD)
Dont Ludwig Everything will be
fine

BEHM
I cant do this Paul I cant I
wanna go back home

PAUL

The barrage gradually recedes to behind the front A few
clods of dirt rain down from the ceiling Behm gets a grip on
himself The soldiers are listening

KAT
It means theyre coming

He grins into the silence The men await the impending
attack Behm chews his lip in fear Paul and Kropp clutch
their rifles

But nothing happens Theres no attack The air is
suffocating Behm yanks open his uniform collar The men sit
there as if sitting in their graves

BOOM The walls shake A SCREAM and FLASH Smoke Sulfur
Dirt Dust The bunker creaks under the hit all the beams
straining but they hold

A frantic recruit 19 years old climbs over the men and
heads for the exit Kat and Tjaden try to stop him

KAT (CONTD)
Where are you going You are
staying here

SOLDIER
No Let me out I wanna get out of
here

KAT
Settle down Clam down god damn

The SOLDIER breaks free and runs towards the exit when a
HUGE EXPLOSION hurls him back ripping the young soldier
apart

Blood spatters Tjadens face Shrapnel and bits of uniforms
everywhere Ludwig Behm is hitting his head against the wall
like a billy goat over and over again Paul almost has to
puke for a moment then the next shell hits the top of the
bunker BOOM BOOM BOOM

KAT (CONTD)

BOOM A direct hit The beams burst over their heads The
soldiers leap up with their rifles and try to flee out of the
bunker

The Sergeant tiredly holds out a bag to him Paul takes it
looks inside A handful of dog tags of dead soldiers He
gives Kat a quizzical look who shrugs

KAT
Helps to keep moving

He takes his shovel gets up and keeps going

Paul limps along the destroyed trench piled with dead He
bends down to them and breaks off their dog tags He places
them in the bag

KRRK Paul suddenly pauses He stepped on something He
slowly bends over and picks up a bloody broken pair of
glasses Behms glasses

Paul frantically runs along the trench until he finds a
lifeless body and turns it over 18-year-old Ludwig Behm lies
dead in the dirt at his feet His eye is bloody Hes missing
a leg

Paul fights back the tears and leans over his dead friend He
tries to button up his uniform collar with trembling hand --
for the cold -- but he cant His fingers are cold Then he
has to sob Violently

SGT STEINBERGER (0S)
Come on keep going Or else this

Kat heads over to the dead Pale faces with cramped hands
None older than 18 their uniforms much too big for them

Wordlessly Kat opens a satchel on his belt and gets out a
handful of chlorinated lime He goes along the row of bodies
and sprinkles them with lime Skinny white bodies in the
dark shining like funeral shrouds

Kat tosses lime on a BOY who suddenly wakes up and
starts to COUGH He stares at him wide-eyed and trembling on
the floor too scared to move

Kat quickly kneels down to him

This isnt a negotiation its a
dictate

COUNT VON OBERNDORFF
Maybe we should go back to Spa to
consult with the High Command

MAJOR GENERAL WINTERFELDT
What good will that do Theres no
alternative but to fight to the
end Even if we wind up losing we
wont be worse off than with this
capitulation

ERZBERGER
Except for a few hundred thousand
more dead

Erzberger stands at the window staring out at his dirty
shoes With a scoff the Major General takes the contract and
waves it like a stinking rag

MAJOR GENERAL WINTERFELDT
This is a complete capitulation
Alsace-Lorraine The occupation of
the Rhineland Cannons
Locomotives Wagons Negotiating
over this is political foolishness

ERZBERGER
250000 Americans are landing in
Europe every month Cambrai Marne
Cantigny -- all lost The only
thing separating us from Armistice
is false pride We will now undo
the mess you and your fellow
Generals have left us But if you
dont want to stay be my guest
We will stay here And then if you
wanna blames someone afterward
well here I am

Erzberger stares at his opponent with a calm but sharp tone
Count von Oberndorff gets involved expressing his doubts

COUNT VON OBERNDORFF
Its winter Without trains and
provisions the Bolsheviks will
overrun us The men will starve on
their way home instead of dying
with honor on the battlefield

ERZBERGER

Erzberger eyes the others coolly Then he turns to Von
Helldorf

ERZBERGER (CONTD)

at the battle in the distance A shadow of a doubt on his
face as he resists the looming defeat

EXT LATIERRE HILL HINTERLAND - DAY 94
Tree trunks blasted by the artillery barrage Their
blackened splintered tree trunks dot the plain In between

a wasteland of craters and holes

Heavy fire covers the land Dead bodies all over The whole
company is retreating

Panting Paul carries the heavy tripod on his shoulder A

SHELL EXPLODES barely five meters away from him killing a
private

THUMP THUMP THUMP The bullets ZING past riddling tree
trunks Soldiers fall all over A plane ROARS overhead also
opening FIRE

With his last strength Paul jumps into a crater for cover

EXT LATIERRE HILL CRATER - DAY 95

An oily mess at the bottom of the crater a yellow puddle of
blood in it Paul leaps in it

Its noon The hot sun burns down Out of breath Paul wipes
the blood off his face His hands tremble uncontrollably

He rises up a bit to look out but quickly ducks down again
GUNS BLAZE SHELLS EXPLODE SOLDIERS race by at a trot --
FRENCHMEN with their Commandos

Paul slides down in the puddle diving in up to his chest He
draws his dagger in terror

He lies curled up in the stinking puddle eyes the dead man
Muffled BOOTSTEPS over him which turn on their heel now
METAL JANGLES FRENCH ORDERS Someone shouts RETRAITE
RETRAITE THUNDER

MGS RATTLE German batteries FIRE repelling the attack
FRENCHMEN leap over his hole in the ground when suddenly
CLACK

A ROUND being chambered

Paul looks up to the top of the crater A FRENCHMAN stands
over him pointing his rifle at him

He shuts his eyes and hugs the ground digs his way in
waiting for death

And then

BOOM An explosion hits the Frenchman and hurls him down by
Paul A bullet hits the water by Paul while the Frenchmen
lands on a gravel bank

Paul immediately goes on the attack He pulls out his dagger
wades through the puddle while the Frenchman crawls toward
his rifle frantically trying to reload but Paul quickly
stabs him in the chest blindly stabbing as the blood spurts
in his face He only feels the body convulse then go soft
and collapse

Paul lies on his back in the mud exhausted coming to again
His hand is sticky and wet The injured FRENCHMAN lies beside
him gasping in his battle between life and death

Trembling Paul takes a handful of dirt and stuffs his mouth
with it

Goldenrod Revision 2242021 66

Then he crawls off to the furthest corner his eyes staring
at the man ready to stab him again if he moves again

Finally Paul dares to move again He puts his helmet on the
Frenchmans bayonet and holds it aloft gingerly but then
CLANG A bullet knocks it right out of his hand

Paul doesnt stand a chance The bullets ZING low over the
ground Hes pinned down

Paul tries to ignore the Frenchmans RATTLE He hisses

PAUL
Shut up

He holds his ears shut groaning until he spots his hand
Blood All over He almost has to throw up He rubs his body
with dirt until it covers all the blood

Suddenly the shape across from him moves The man tries to
lift his head With his final effort he spits out the mud
then he collapses again

Paul looks at him for the first time A small mustache over
his full lips his slack hand on his chest Paul gingerly
crawls up to him lying beside him

The man opens his eyes wide in fear His body is quiet no
more gasping but his eyes are SCREAMING

Paul gently strokes his forehead but the man recoils from
his touch

PAUL (CONTD)
No no No no no

The mans mouth gapes open He tries to talk
Paul digs the dirt out of his mouth He looks around His
canteen is gone So he spoons the yellow water out of the mud

puddle with his handkerchief The Frenchman drinks it

Finally Paul opens his collar His shirt is stuck shut Paul
digs for his knife in the mud to cut it open

The man sees the knife He desperately tries to defend
himself but hes too weak Theres the fear the scream in
his eyes
Paul holds his eyes shut
PAUL (CONTD)
No no Comrade Camarade

camarade camarade

Paul whispers in his ear Finally he places a few bandages
on his bleeding wounds

( )

Goldenrod Revision 2242021 67 95

The man finally dies A last twitch he stops WHEEZING the
front starts to quiet down

Paul GULPS He whispers

PAUL (CONTD)
Camarade Camarade Im sorry Im
sorry

No answer He gingerly adjusts the dead mans body bedding
his head more comfortably in the mud Then he shuts the mans
eyes

The mans uniform is half open Paul takes out a wallet from
which a few letters fall in the mud

A picture of a mother with a little girl Simple country
folks standing before am ivy-colored wall

Paul takes the letters and tries to read them but cant
understand the French He opens his pay book in back of the
wallet

The soldiers name on the cover He reads
Gérard Duval Typograph
Paul gulps With wet lips he whispers in the Frenchmans
ear almost like hes praying giving confession A few words
reach him
PAUL (CONTD)

Maison ta femme Je promets

Promise
Paul wipes the mud off the mans face He notes down the dead
mans address on the bloody envelope Then he sticks the

wallet back in the mans coat

Tired with exhaustion and hunger he lowers his head on his
arms suddenly listening up

Nothing No more gunfire A pale sky over him a flock of
birds crosses it The battle has moved on Night starts to
fall

Paul trembles with excitement his will to live comes back

EXT LATIERRE HILL HINTERLAND - DUSK 96
Paul peers over the edge of the crater carefully Fog
shrouds the charred tree stumps Its otherwise quiet and
deserted

Paul crawls out of the crater and stumbles on past corpses
and a deserted bunker in the middle of nowhere

returning soldiers

GENERAL FRIEDRICHS

home a hero

He shakes his head and discovers a stain on his uniform
pants

GENERAL FRIEDRICHS (CONTD)
We were born too late Major A
half-century of peace Who needs
soldiers without war

He pensively dips his napkin in a glass of water and rubs the
stain on his pants Von Brixdorf gulps and looks at the
General who can only barely hide his thirst for glory

MAJOR VON BRIXDORF
Were you and your father close

General Friedrichs shrugs
GENERAL FRIEDRICHS

a battle in its 500 year history

watch as they strip us of power and
honor

Young Walter who just arrived at the front behind Paul He
listens to the Generals speech in confusion with a mixture
of fear and adventure on his face He shuts his eyes and
starts to pray

cowards who turned and ran when the
chips were down How do you want
your wives and children to remember
you

voice

headlock from behind

The man drops his rifle grabs Pauls arm with both hands to
free himself from his grasp Paul throws his gun away and
starts to strangle him

They wrestle Elbow and knee each other Tug choke and
punch A battle of blood and chaos in the mud

finally manages to trip him up The two men lose their
balance and fall in the mud

The Frenchman lands atop Paul in a puddle at the bottom of
the trench Gasping he tries to drown him in the mud
presses his fingers in his eyes and mouth

Paul can hardly breathe almost downing in the puddle
Finally he gets his hand on a rock and HITS the Frenchman on
the head WHAM

Then a very young FRENCHMAN charges out of the shadows
and rams his bayonet in Pauls back WHAM And again

Paul stares down at his chest incredulous where the blade
sticks out

The Frenchman pulls the bayonet out again Paul sinks to his
knees A distant WHISTLE from outside

A last look at his opponent then the Frenchmen turn away and
disappear

Paul is alone now He staggers down the stairs with an effort
into the trench

Paul looks up and listens to the silence He looks at the
sky where the fog wafts by Its all so bright and white
Finally he sinks to the ground drained of energy Blood
gushes out of his wound

He wears Franzs scarf Paul looks down at it He slowly
opens the knot to hold it in his hand

His lungs fill with air for one last time The life slowly
drains from his gaze and he just keels over lifelessly

MAJOR VON BRIXDOR

The tired Major holds a bag of dog tags out to Walter who
takes them He weighs them in his hand and looks inside
heavy

The tin rattles in the bag

Walter finally gets up and heads down the trench bending
down to the dead deadpan taking their dog tags and putting
them in the bag

A soldier sits on the ground leaning on the trench wall
Walter lifts his head and gapes

Its Paul Baumer High school student 19 years old His
expression is composed almost serene He could almost be
asleep But hes dead

Walter kneels down to him and takes his dog tag He seems to
hesitate for a moment Then he takes the scarf from Pauls
hand ties it around his own neck and keeps going

He makes his way down the trench He will always wear the
scarf from now on
