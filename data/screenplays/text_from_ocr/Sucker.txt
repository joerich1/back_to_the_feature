The Screenplay

INT ANTHONYS HOUSE - NIGHT

Total darkness surrounds us except for a streak of pale
moonlight coming through a window illumating a DOOR
We hear a KNOCK then the jingle of KEYS

After a moment the door opens and a large heavyset MAN comes
into the house

He walks casually through the foyer to a staircase and begins to
climb the stairs

His name is REED As he climbs the stairs we hear him in voice
over

REED (VO)
They dont advertise for vampire
henchman in the newspaper Thats
in the special magazines and
then you dont believe the ads That
was my profession Ex-roadie
Ex-nurse Ex-henchman Sushi thats
what I always called em cause he
liked to leave em in the water
like a cold fish

INT ANTHONYS BATHROOM

Still dark the bathroom is lit only by the moon We can make out
the body of a LIFELESS GIRL totally naked in the shower

After a beat the heavyset man enters

Reed laughs self consciously as he turns the shower off He
reaches down and picks up the dead girl by her armpits As he
lifts her and spins her around BAM She smashes right into
the glass door of the shower

INT NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

This smoky mephistophilian club is being rocked tonight by a
gothic rock band PLASMA

Fronting the band is ANTHONY He plays the bass and sings He
clearly enjoys being the center of attention

Reeds voice over continues

REED (VO)
Pretty cool huh Yeah I know This
This was the night See theres
Anthony You cant really see him but
man is he singing
Behind Anthony is SETH the guitar player

REED (VO)
See now theres Seth Seth well
he was always kind of a jerk to me

As the band plays we see one particularly good looking concert
goer as she elbows her way to the front of the stage She is
VANESSA

REED (VO)
Oh That that is Miss Helsing
I remember her I remember her because
that was the night well Anthony
broke up the band can you believe
it Yeah Shed been coming to the
shows for a couple of months I knew
Anthony wouldnt like her cause you
know he likes blondes but I thought
maybe for Seth I thought Seth might
like her

INT BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

REED stands backstage watching the band as they play He dances
completely out of rhythm with the song

Several CONCERT GOERS watch his antics in amazement
REED (VO)
With the benefit of hindsight maybe
it wasnt such a hot idea

INT GREEN ROOM - NIGHT

TOBIN the drummer is sitting next to SETH on a couch They both
look up as

ANTHONY enters and walks over to a table where a tiny igloo
cooler sits He picks up a plastic baggie filled with a dark
red viscous liquid and pours some into his mug via a tube
sticking from the bag

SETH

ANTHONY
It was good For a last
performance

Seth stops for a second then continues

SETH
Thats it just like that

ANTHONY

SETH
Who are you man Perry Ferrel
Things are going great weve
got offers on the table

ANTHONY
Which is why we have to
fade out

Anthony heads over to a small microwave and puts his mug inside He nukes it
for a minute

SETH
Anthony think about this
Were not huge We dont have a
CD Weve got another couple
months of obscurity So whats
your problem

ANTHONY
Youre my problem right now
If you want to run the risk of
being discovered do it with
another band
Tobin stops drinking says nothing
Seth glares at Tobin
SETH
Well Say something Tobin

either

Anthony sips from the mug he exchanges a look with Tobin

TOBIN

Seth sighs

SETH

ANTHONY

pursue other avenues do what
ever you want

SETH

ultimate chick magnet

ANTHONY
The discussion is over
Anthony sips from his mug as the door opens
REED escorts SANDY a gorgeous blonde and VANESSA in

SETH

Anthony takes Sandy by the hand and leads her over to a vacant
couch

SANDY

Vanessa walks over and lovingly touches Seths guitar He
follows her hungrily

VANESSA

VANESSA
Is that some sort of sick
pun

Seth moves in close grabs Vanessa and pushes her up against the
wall

SETH
Sure

Seth moves in on Vanessa and kisses her Vanessa seems not only unsurprised
but eager

Reed noticing the amorous impulses around him gets
uncomfortable and shambles over to the couch where Anthony and
Sandy are sitting

Reed grins

REED

Sandy reaches out to shake Reeds hand

SANDY

Anthony turns to Reed flashes him a look Reed knows hes done
wrong and blanches

REED

Seth is absorbed with his grovelling and doesnt say anything
ANTHONY
I was wondering if youd

house with me Theres only

Sandy nods in lusty agreement
Anthony smiles He stands and extends his hand out to Sandy

Sandy looks over at Vanessa and Seth

SANDY

putting his hand at her throat

VANESSA

Vanessa fires the mace canister it hits Seth in the face
Seth laughs and bares a frightening set of FANGS

SETH

Suddenly Seths laughter turns to a SCREAM His face SMOKES and
he collapses in agony

VANESSA

Vanessa walks across the room to where she left her bag

VANESSA

Vanessa taps the canister

sailboat He hums a nondescript song to himself

EXT ANTHONYS HOUSE POOL - NIGHT
Anthony slowly crosses to the pool and slips in
He goes to Sandy

They begin kissing undulating together the water becoming the
perfect medium for their lovemaking

We see only their heads above the surface of the water

Sandy starts to clasp Anthonys head in her hands her passion
becoming more frenzied

He kisses her moves to her ear kisses moves down to her neck
Sandy is in total heaven her head lolls to one side

Anthony moves his head back just a touch opens his mouth only
long enough for us to see the glimmer of his FANGS

As he bites into Sandys neck she shrieks and futilely tries
to push him away In a moment she is gone

As Sandys body goes limp we see a growing cloud of scarlet
BLOOD as it seeps out into the pool

INT ANTHONYS BOAT - NIGHT

REED sits alone in the boat a sparsely decorated place Hes
doing some light cleaning as his PAGER goes off
Reed rises picks his pager off his belt and looks at it

He moves to the door takes his trenchcoat up along the way and
exits

INT ANTHONYS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

ANTHONY sits in his living room smoking a cigarette on the
couch Hes watching the television

Anthony looks up as he hears a KEY in the front door lock

He continues to watch After a beat theres a KNOCK on the door
Anthony rises and heads toward the front door

He walks to the door and yanks it open revealing REED crouched
with his head by the door knob Reed is tethered to the door by a

string around his neck

ANTHONY
What took you so long

REED
My key Got stuck Indeedoor

Anthony moves Reed aside and pulls the key from door

Reed stands up and laughs nervously He takes the key which he
wears like a pendant and tucks it back into his shirt

Anthony walks back toward the living room Reed follows him in
Anthony looks at Reed impatiently
ANTHONY
Hurry up
REED
Okay

Reed leaves and heads toward the BEDROOM

ANTHONY
Reed

Reed stops

ANTHONY
Shes in the pool

Reed turns and looks out the window where he sees the lifeless
body of SANDY floating face down

REED
Oh

Reed heads for the front door
As Anthony continues to watch we see Reed make his way pool
side

He looks at the body for a long time wondering how to get to it
Then he looks over and sees a POOL HOOK He walks over and grabs
the tool then returns to the pool

Anthony stands glances out at the pool then retrieves a large
PHOTO ALBUM from the hearth He sits down and starts to leaf
through it

ANGLE ON THE PHOTO ALBUM

The page it has been turned to holds a PHOTOGRAPH of an elederly
gentleman sitting with a stake in one hand He has a young girl
sitting on his lap

The man is wearing a celtic cross over his shirt
INT ANTHONYS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
ANTHONY looks at the album

In the background Reed leans out over the pool and tries several
times to hook the corpse to no avail

Finally he balances himself precariously on one foot and extends
his arms out Just as the hook encircles the body Reed loses his
balance and goes flailing into the pool

Anthony doesnt even notice

Reed climbs out of the pool and trudges to the window

Anthony is totally absorbed in the photograph

Reed raps on the window

Anthony looks over sees the soaking wet figure then shakes his
head Anthony closes the album and returns his attention to the
television

Reed discouraged goes back toward the pool

ANGLE ON THE TELEVISION

We see THE MALIBU LIFEGUARD WORKOUT

SANDY over his shoulder She is wrapped in a large towel

Reed watches TV over Anthonys shoulder Then he takes a tiny
SHIP IN A BOTTLE from under his arm and quietly puts it on the
living room table

REED

nicknack in the closet and resumes his path to the bedroom

throws the limp form down

He walks over to the kitchen and gets a small BOWL fills it with
water and returns to the bed

Reed uncovers Sandy He takes a moment looks at her pale
naked body

He takes a corner of the sheet and dips it in the water then
uses the damp piece of cloth to sponge the blood from her body

humming to himself

Reed gets up and goes to a closet He rifles through it finding
A CAMERA mounted on a tripod

He goes back to the bedside and sets the camera up pointing it
at Sandy

Reed flips her over and positions her on the bed He disappears
Moments pass

He takes a position next to Sandy on the bed He wraps her arms
around him and leans into her He kisses her neck as we see a
WHITE FLASH
