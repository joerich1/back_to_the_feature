toward the Figures in the piazza The poodle WHIMPERS

away boogieing on to the music in her head then
disappearing into the shadows of some fake-Roman statuary
that borders the piazza

Two Figures run out of the piazza jump into the Ford

IN A SERIES OF CUTS we SEE two SQUAD CARS arrive 10
ONLOOKERS gather an AMBULANCE pull up a FORENSIC UNIT
PHOTOGRAPHERS taking pictures of the body and the scene

Remy enters through the open doorway dressed in

a very well-cut business suit

There are about a dozen desks occupied by DETECTIVES
In the back are two glassed-in offices one small
one large Anne sits waiting in the small office -
Remys

In the larger office Captain Kellom is bawling out
ED DODGE and ANDRE DE SOTO They are both about
Remys age -came out of the Police Academy together
but neither has fared as well as Remy De Soto has
eaten himself into a mountain Dedge is thin always
needs a shave and wears a cheap toupee

As soon as Kellom spots Remy he bursts out into the

(grins)
Not so far Look Ive seen dozens of
these wise-gquy jobs We usually find
out why the hit went down sometimes we
find out who did it we even make an
arrest once in a while but we never
have enough to take to court

Anne who has been writing furiously on her legal pad
suddenly breaks the point of her pencil As Remy
deftly hands her a new one from his desk top McCabe
taps on Remys office door and opens it

McCABE
He wasnt at the barber shop so
we had to go pick him up at his
house

REMY
Bring him in

Remy rises as Vincent The Cannon™ Di Moti enters
A once young and vigorous capo unwilling to admit
hes old--his hair is dyed his cheeks are rouged
he wears a dark pin-striped suits his cane is in
the shape of a golf club

REMY
Thank you for coming in Mr Di Moti
This is Miss Osborne with the District
Attorneys office

The Cannon lowers himself onto a chair leaning on his
cane So

THE CANNON
My lawyer is gonna get me out of

nothing to say til then”

REMY
(shocked)
Why youre not under arrest Mr Di
Moti Did McCabe here give you that
impression Apologize to Mr Di Meti

McCABE

(plays along)
Im sorry for the misunderstanding
Mr Di Moti

REMY
Youre free to go anytime Mr Di
Moti We apologize

The Cannon rises with difficulty starts for the
door

REMY
We only wanted to express our
sympathy about Freddie
The Cannon stops at the door turns

‘THE CANNON
’ who

REMY
You know Freddie Angelo the
guy they found floating in the
fountain last night behind your
office

THE CANNON
Oh yeah He used to work for
me Terrible thing Nobody
has any respect for monuments
anymore

He turns to leave again anne suddenly jumps in

ANNE
Isnt it true that Mr Angelo
worked for you for twenty years
and that he was in fact in your
employ at the time of his death

The Cannon looks at Remy as if to say “who the hell
is this” Remy shrugs

Remy nods
followed by

io

THE CANNON
You know kid your father
would never have dragged me
down here like this He
knew a little something about
respect Can I go now

The Cannon strides out of the office
McCabe Anne turns to Remy steaming

I cant believe you were so
obsequious with that man

REMY
What does obsequious mean

ANNE
It means you had a high ranking
member of the Mafia in your
office and you kissed his ass

REMY
Well first of all nobody uses
word “mafia” anymore Down here
we call ‘em “wise gays I only
mention this to save you
embarrassment

ANNE

Ill bear that in mind
Anything elise

REMY
Actually I learned a lot from

that little interview

ANNE
Oh yeah You read Tarot cards

REMY

(laughs)
I read people For instance
after seeing The Cannon I
ean probably tell you why Freddie
sprung a leak last night Hey
you like spicy food Why dont
we have dinner tonight I know
a place
1l

ANNE
Just tell me what you found
out from two minutes of ass-
kissing

A beat Remy is beginning to realize that Ms Osborne
is quite capable of holding her own

REMY
Freddie Angelo was one of the
Cannons top men see Killing
him and dumping him in the Piazza
Itaila--that was a message to
Vinnie

ANNE
And the message was

REMY
I think somebodys telling him
its time to retire Last time’
I saw him he didnt have a hearing
aid or a cane either Hes
gotton old Some of his people
may be getting restless

ANNE
This all sounds pretty flimsy
to me

REMY
Theres more Normally he goes
to his barber every morning for
a shave and a manicure Today
he stayed home

ANNE
Meaning what

REMY’
Meaning the message is coming
through loud and clear

ANNE
I suppose you know who the
killer is too

REMY
No put in a week or so TI bet
‘we find his body

ANNE
Then what will you do

REMY
Nothing Well never get
anything we can take to court

If all the codes were enforced
you wouldnt have a restaurant in

clutching a womans purse Instinctively Anne swings
one of her shopping bags at the muggers legs and the
mugger takes a nosedive into the pavement But Anne
doesnt see

THE SECOND MEGGER who plows into her and she smashes
into the pavement with a sickening crunch The winds

‘been knocked out of her but still she grabs the Second

Muggers ankle He tries to twist away but

ANNE wont let go even though hes dragging her along
the pavement trying to kick his foot out of her grip
But now the

FIRST MUGGER has gotten up and has pulled a knife on

Anne either to threaten her or to stick her but just
then
REMYS LEBARON bounces up onto the sidewalk knocks
the First Mugger flying In a flash Remys out of
the car gun down and shouting

REMY

The Second Mugger tries to dodge past and Remy slams
him on the side of the head with the pistol and he
sinks to his knees Remy levels his gun right at the
First Muggers face no more than four feet away

‘Don ty wserew up

The First Mugger arops the knife Anne-- dazed--
starts to get up but Remy stops her

time his gun covering them closely He flings the
contents of their pockets out into the gutter

Anne gets to her knees Her dress is torn her knee
is scraped She crawls a couple of feet to one of
her shopping bags and is trying to put the contents
back in the bag

REMY
(continuing to Anne)
Just sit there a minute Good

A dumpy S5-years old WOMAN the victim of the mugging

runs up gasping for breath Remy picks up the womans

purse from the sidewalk and hands it to her

WOMAN

The Woman checks through her purse then satisfied that
the contents are intact starts to hobble away —

REMY
If youll stay a moment a
patrolman will take your
statement

WOMAN
You think Im crazy or what

And she leaves muttering under her breath Remy
ignores her He handcuffs the prisoners together
running the chain of the handcuffs through his LeBarons
bumper so the prisoners cant get away

Remy crouches close to the Muggers and pitches his
voice low so that Anne cannot hear him

REMY
A patrol car is going to come for
you in a little while If you do
anything to my car if you even get
fingerprints on the paint theyre
going to beat the living shit out

He raises his voice for Annes benefit

nothing under the covers except the tiniest motions
of his fingers

Stop that

She says it without conviction and he doesnt stop
Theres a long moment of silence and no movement
except for his fingers’ tiny motions Then very
slowly her hips begin to move to match his rhythm
then gradually take on an insistent rhythm of their
own -

Now Anne makes a series of small sounds short tight —
little cries which she repeats over and over again and
now louder and louder as she hits her orgasm

Remys hands guide her body into a good angle and he F)
enters her

Angelo went to Veracruz three
days before he was killed

The brown Ford SCREECHES to a halt as a garbage truck
comes lumbering up the narrow alley blocking its

down the alley--right at Remy

FIRES two quick shots at the Ford thats about to run
him down then sprints toward the side of the alley
But the Ford turns follewing-- an incredibly skillful
move as the Ford is speeding in reverse--and Remy
jumps up the wall he just come over--dropping his gun
His fingers just catch the top of the wall

We have an eyewitness who saw
two men in an unmarked police
car-dump Freddie Angelos body
in the Piazza dItalia

REMY
How did they know it was an
unmarked police car

ANNE
She saw the blue light and
the radio on the seat

Why did you withhold that

Because the police are the
suspects
