underwater and he leaps from his board into the sea He
swims several meters down grabs an oyster from a coral reef
and heads back to the surface

How much time does he have

TECH 2
At this rate of outgassing Id say
fifteen minutes max

COLBY
(over mic)
You hear that Buff Looks like
were going to need you to do an
unscheduled EVA

Buff is already putting on his spacesuit As he puts his arm
in the sleeve he notices the tear from earlier

BUFF
Right Hey Chief I forgot to
mention upon entering the craft I
acquired a small tear in my suit

COLBY
A tear You tore your suit and you
didnt tell us

BUFF
In my defense I did not expect to
be leaving the module

COLBY
Damn it
(to Tech 1)
What are our other options

Youll have to keep them tightly
shut Buff to prevent ocular
explosivity

BUFF
Okay Colby Do I have a go

heartland of America to Jack and
Greta Taggart Jack Taggart had
been a World War I flyboy

We see a young Jack Taggart standing beside a bi-plane

WILLIAM SHATNER (VO) (CONTD)
-while Greta stayed at home
growing badly needed corn for the
war effort

In a series of photos Greta squats beside an ear of corn
As it grows larger and larger she stays in the same
position

WILLIAM SHATNER (VO) (CONTD)
In 1951 when Buff was only eight
tragedy struck the Taggart farm A
powerful tornado took the life of
his father Then one year later
the same tornado killed his mother

We see a photo of Jack running from a massive tornado Then
one of Greta running from a tornado which now has a skeleton
inside it

WILLIAM SHATNER (VO) (CONTD)
A devastated Buff was sent to a
government home for wayward boys
where he developed a fascination
with the heavenly bodies that
floated above his squalid quarters

Ten year old Buff lies on the roof of an orphanage staring up
at the night sky

WILLIAM SHATNER (VO) (CONTD)
Five years later at the age of
fifteen Buff lied about his age in
order to enlist in the US Air Force
like his father before him

We see fifteen year old Buff wearing a fake beard standing
beside several taller older pilots and their planes

The Forty Thousand Dollar Man 17

WILLIAM SHATNER (VO) (CONTD)
Thanks to his fearlessness and
outstanding flying skill Buff
quickly rose to the top of his
squadron And when the conflict in
Vietnam broke out it was Buff who
led his fellow flyers into combat

Twenty-something Buff sits in the cockpit of an F-4 Phantom
fighter plane giving a thumbs-up

WILLIAM SHATNER (VO) (CONTD)
After winning the war Buff
returned stateside Thats when
NASA came calling They were
looking for a few brave men to join
in the race to space

seventeen Buff became the first
man to drive the lunar rover the
first man to throw a javelin on the
moon

the unknown For that is what
makes a man a hero Anda hero a
legend

last couple days Buff Now its
time to see what those bionic legs
of yours can do

Oscar extends his hand and Buff takes it hoisting himself
out of the wheelchair

BUFF
It feels good to stand again

OSCAR

Imagine how itll feel to run sixty
miles an hour

The Forty Thousand Dollar Man 31

BUFF
What

OSCAR
Thats right Your bionic legs
were designed to achieve a top
speed of a mile a minute

BUFF
I thought you said sixty miles an
hour

OSCAR

That comes out to a mile a minute

BUFF
I dont think so

OSCAR
It does You need to trust me

BUFF
(still doubtful)
Youre the boss

A Technician raises a starters pistol and fires
In SLOW MOTION
Buff starts to run down the track Oscar stands with Luther
who holds a stopwatch They grin as it appears Buffs legs
are working according to plan

NORMAL SPEED

As the image returns to normal motion we see Buff is not
actually running all that fast

OSCAR
How fast is he going Luther

The Forty Thousand Dollar Man 32

LUTHER
Twenty miles an hour sir

OSCAR
Slightly faster than a normal man
Disappointing

Oscar picks up a megaphone and calls out to Buff

OSCAR (CONTD)
Buff can you go any faster

BUFF
(yelling)
I dont think so

OSCAR
All right Then bring it in

BUFF
You got it Oscar

Buff waves and tries to slow down but he cant

He continues to run quickly around the track flailing his
arms clearly not in control of his speed

LUTHER

Hes not stopping Mr Goldman
OSCAR

I can see that Luther

(calling)

Buff You can stop now
BUFF

I I cant The legs wont stop
OSCAR

Damn it
Buff continues running his arms hanging at his sides

BUFF
Can anyone help me

DISSOLVE TO
The Forty Thousand Dollar Man 33

EXT RUNNING TRACK - ONE HOUR LATER

Buff cries softly as he continues involuntarily running
around the track

BUFF

(weepy)
These legs are raping me

Oscar watches as a pickup truck with Technicians in the bed
drives alongside Buff Luther reaches out trying to slow
Buffs pace

LUTHER
Almost got you

Just as he is about to grab hold of Buff Buffs bionic arm
punches him sending Luther flying off the pickup onto the
track

BUFF
Sorry Luther

As Buff reaches a bend in the track the truck continues
straight towards the cement wall forcing Buff to go straight
as well The truck comes to a stop but Buff speeds towards
the wall

BUFF (CONTD)
Oh no

Bam Buff slams into the wall and goes down His bionic
legs continue to run as Buff lies face down groaning

Oscar watching from a distance shakes his head with
disgust

CUT TO
INT EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY
Oscar stands with Buff
OSCAR
Today were going to see how well

your bionic eye and nose function

BUFF
Great

The Forty Thousand Dollar Man 34

OSCAR
I want you to start by focusing on
that eye chart with your right eye

BUFF
Okay

Buff closes his left eye while squinting with his right
From Buffs POV we see the eye chart
SFX Bionic sound effect

Suddenly his view ZOOMS IN dramatically till we see nothing
but the black ink of the letters

BUFF (CONTD)
What the--

OSCAR
Can you read the bottom line

BUFF
All I see is black

OSCAR
Black

Buff looks over at Oscar From his POV we see an EXTREME
CLOSE-UP of Oscars lips They flap open horribly saliva
droplets clinging to the corner of his mouth as he speaks

OSCAR (CONTD)
What do you mean black

Buff jumps back startled

BUFF
Ahh

OSCAR
What is it

BUFF
I think my eye is overzooming

OSCAR
Overzooming

The Forty Thousand Dollar Man 35

BUFF
Everythings too close How do I
pull back

OSCAR
Oh It only has two settings
Zoom And not zoom

BUFF
That doesnt seem very--

Buffs POV we zoom in on Oscars forehead Its a sea of
pores and blackheads

BUFF (CONTD)
Sweet mother Your skin Oscar
its terrible

OSCAR
Stop it Buff

BUFF
Im sorry its just--

CLOSE ON tiny droplets of oil on Oscars face

BUFF (CONTD)
Uch Its so oily

OSCAR
Its perfectly normal to have a
certain amount of oil on the
skin

BUFF
Certain amount Its like the menu
at a diner

OSCAR
Zoom out

BUFF
Its like the seat of a taxi

OSCAR
I said zoom out

Buff does His view returns to normal

The Forty Thousand Dollar Man

BUFF

I dont get it Oscar What good
is an eye that can only see your

horrible pores and greasy skin

OSCAR

We havent ironed out all the kinks

yet
(then testy)

Would you rather we had left that
gaping hole you had when we found

you

BUFF
No

OSCAR

All right then On to your bionic
nose Its been designed to be a
thousand times stronger than the

normal nose

BUFF
I hope its not as oily as the
normal nose

OSCAR
Thats enough

Oscar indicates a row of pedestals concealed by small

screens

OSCAR (CONTD)

Now behind each of these screens
is an item I want you to identify

the items solely by their smell

BUFF
Okay

Oscar points to the first screen

OSCAR

Lets start with this one Can you

smell whats behind it

Buff inhales deeply through his nose focusing his attention

on the first screen

SFX Bionic sound effect

The Forty Thousand Dollar Man 37

BUFF
Okay I smell something Im
getting
(Buff scrunches his nose)
Its kinda earthy No wait
funky Ugh Its feces You put
poop on that pedestal

Oscar lifts up the screen revealing a lemon

OSCAR (CONT’D)
Its a lemon

BUFF
Oh

Buff squints his eye
SFX Bionic sound effect

BUFF (CONTD)
Wow that is one oily lemon

OSCAR
All right try the next screen
Smell anything

Buff sniffs and nods

BUFF
Uh huh Definitely doodie

OSCAR
Buff this is no time for
horseplay

BUFF
Im not kidding Oscar All I
smell behind that screen is poop

Oscar sighs and lifts the screen to reveal a single rose

OSCAR
You cant smell this rose

The Forty Thousand Dollar Man 38

BUFF
No all there is is an overwhelming
smell of turd Actually
Buff wrinkles his nose and heads toward the doorway

BUFF (CONTD)
It seems to be coming from outside

Buff exits into
INT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Buff makes his way down the hall sniffing the air Oscar
follows

BUFF
Yup Its stronger out here
(wincing)
Ugh how can anyone work in here
Its like a cesspool

OSCAR

Buff reaches the door to the mens room

BUFF
Its coming from in here

Buff opens the door and enters

OSCAR
Buff wait

INT MENS ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Buff and Oscar step into the mens room Buff immediately
crosses over to one of the stalls

BUFF
This is it Im sure of it

Buff grabs the handle and using his bionic arm tears the
door off its hinges Inside Luther sits on the toilet his
arm in a cast

LUTHER
Hey

The Forty Thousand Dollar Man 39

OSCAR
Sorry about this Luther

BUFF
Oh Hi Luther

OSCAR
Well the good news here is that
your arm seems to be working

BUFF
Oh yeah Look at that

OSCAR
And your bionic nose is able to
detect faint odors from a great
distance

BUFF
But the only thing I can smell
really well is shit

OSCAR
At least its a starting point

They consider this for a beat

LUTHER
Do you guys mind

OSCARBUFF
RightSorry Luther

They move away from the stall
CUT TO
INT OSI OFFICES - A FEW DAYS LATER

Buff now wearing civilian clothes (silk shirt bell
bottoms) enters Oscars office

BUFF
You wanted to see me Oscar

OSCAR
Buff Yes come in

Buff enters and sits

The Forty Thousand Dollar Man 40

OSCAR (CONTD)
Its been two weeks since your
accident How are you feeling

BUFF
A lot better than when that sign
fell on me

OSCAR
I can imagine And how are you
adjusting to the bionics

BUFF
Well it was hard at first But
theyre really starting to feel
like a part of me

He gives Oscar a thumbs-up with his bionic arm

OSCAR
Im glad to hear it

Buffs thumbs-up remains up Buff glances at it nervously
He obviously cant put it down

SFX Bionic sound effect continues over the following

BUFF
So am I ready to go home I sure
do miss Bonnie

OSCAR
Thats actually what I wanted to
speak to you about

Buff casually tries to pull down his right arm with his left
It wont come down

BUFF

What uh what do you mean
OSCAR

You see Buff are you okay
BUFF

Im great

He indicates the thumbs-up to emphasize his point

The Forty Thousand Dollar Man 41

BUFF (CONTD)
Please go on

OSCAR
The thing is we didnt spend forty
thousand dollars of taxpayer money
just to save a dying astronaut

With his good hand Buff grabs Oscars nameplate off the desk
and tries to hammer down his frozen bionic arm with it

BUFF
You didnt

OSCAR
(re arm)
Do you want me to get someone

BUFF
No Ive got this

Buff grunts as he wrestles with his thumbs-up arm finally
forcing it down breaking off the chairs armrest in the
process He grins sheepishly

OSCAR
The bionics program was designed to
create a kind of super-agent An
agent who could carry out
classified missions that no
ordinary man could

BUFF
What sort of missions

OSCAR
Im glad you asked

Oscar presses a button on his desk The lights dim and a
projection screen descends from the ceiling

BUFF
Neat

Oscar narrates the images we see on the screen
OSCAR
For the last several years our

government has been tracking this
man Luis Guzman

The Forty Thousand Dollar Man 42

We see a squat nefarious looking man in a flashy white suit

OSCAR (CONTD)
Guzmans company is the number one
provider of disco balls and disco-
related paraphernalia in the world
OSI believes that this is merely a
front

BUFF
For what

OSCAR
We raided one of Guzmans
warehouses and found that each of
his disco balls was packed with ten
pounds of pure Columbian cocaine

BUFF
Why not arrest him

OSCAR
Weve tried but Guzman always gets
wind of our plans Our hope is
that by sending in one lone agent
we can capture him before he even
realizes were there

BUFF
And Im that agent

OSCAR
If you think youre ready

BUFF
I know Im ready

Buff gives a thumbs-up again with his right hand Theres a
beat as he realizes

again zooms too far All he can see is a close-up of

Guzmans nostril hair

BUFF
Useless

Back to normal view Buff turns back to the Bartender

That wasnt so hard was it

He moves to release the mans hand but instead keeps
squeezing harder

BARTENDER
Why are you doing this You said

BUFF
Im sorry Im trying to let go

BARTENDER
Oh sweet mother Someone please

Other disco patrons notice them The Bartender starts to
weep

BUFF
Gosh this is embarrassing I am

of the liquid onto his legs

Buff looks down and notices a puff of smoke rising from his
lap His legs appear to be shorting out

He tries to casually pat down his legs but the short circuit
only gets worse

it revealing a shiny new eyeball

BUFF
(jumps )
Ahh
(then)
A new eye

OSCAR
This one has a zoom that works
Try it out

BUFF
Okay

Buff sticks his thumb in his bionic eye and plucks it out
with a POP It rolls onto the desk He takes the new eye
and squishes it into his eye socket

We see from his POV as the new eye comes into focus He
zooms in and out effortlessly to different distances The
center of the view is obstructed by a thick cross-hair

BUFF (CONTD)

Wow This is great It really
works

The Forty Thousand Dollar Man 77

OSCAR
I paid for that one myself Its
my gift to you A small way of
saying Im sorry

BUFF
Well thank you Oscar I really
appreciate it

The cross-hairs pretty thick huh

OSCAR
Thats right It will allow you to
zoom in on your target with great
precision

BUFF
Uh huh Kind of hard to see around
the cross-hair though

OSCAR
Im sure youll get used to that

We again see Buffs POV The cross-hair does take up most of
his field of vision

BUFF
I guess so

So theres no way they can make
the cross-hair any thinner

I dont think so

flag would align with the moons
natural fault lines

A final video The image we saw earlier of Buff planting a
flag on the lunar surface Zoom in to see another blinking
light on the pole

COLBY (CONTD)

And now that I have you both here
you will be witness to this great
moment The moment when itll be
one small step for man one giant
boom for moonkind

BUFF
Youre insane Colby

COLBY

A little maybe But wouldnt you
be too if youd spent your life
watching your pals go on to fame
and glory while you sat there on
the ground monitoring heart rates
and singing them to sleep Didnt
it ever occur to you that I might
want to go to the moon just once

The Forty Thousand Dollar Man 94

BUFF
Well that wasnt really up to me--

COLBY
It was up to NASA And they
rejected my application to join the
astronaut corps Again and again
they told me I wasnt astronaut
material Well Im going down in
history one way or another

BUFF
How did you get the money to do all
this

COLBY

My dad invented the yo-yo with the
light in it

BUFF
Oh nice
(then)
And what do you think is going to
keep me from stopping your crazy
plan

COLBY
Thats easy He is

Colby pushes a button on his remote control and Steve
suddenly lurches towards Buff

COLBY (CONT’D)
Goodbye Buff

Colby hands the controller to an ASSISTANT and crosses off to
the detonation room as Buff backs away from an advancing
Steve Austin

BUFF
Easy Steve easy

Steve takes a bionic swing at Buff Buff dodges the blow

BUFF (CONTD)
Okay I know that wasnt you

Buff looks over at the Assistant with the controller and
lunges towards him

The Forty Thousand Dollar Man 95

Before Buff can reach him Steve tackles him and hurls him
against a wall fifty feet away Buff goes down hard

BUFF (CONTD)
Man those are good bionics

CUT TO
INT DETONATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Colby hurries in to the room where another Assistant VINCE
is waiting

COLBY
Is everything ready Vince

VINCE
Yes sir

COLBY
Very well Lets blow up that damn
rock

He turns to a wall on which we see two keyholes set more than
arms length apart

COLBY (CONT’D)
Insert your key

Colby takes a key from his pocket and inserts it into one
keyhole while Vince does the same at the other keyhole

COLBY (CONT’D)
Now on my mark we turn our keys
simultaneously Three two one

Vince turns his key before Colby

COLBY (CONTD)
I didnt say mark

VINCE
Oh Im sorry I thought we were
doing it on one

COLBY
No on mark Lets try it
again

BACK TO
The Forty Thousand Dollar Man 96

INT TARANTULAS COMPOUND - CONTINUOUS

Buff gets up and spots a fire extinguisher on the wall He
grabs it and throws it as hard as he can at Steve Steve
swats it away effortlessly and starts to cross toward Buff

BUFF
This is so unfair

Buff looks up and notices a large electromagnet hanging from
a crane directly above where Steve is walking

BACK TO
INT DETONATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Colby and Vince are as we left them
COLBY
(frustrated)
Come on Vince I gave you three
Mississippis
VINCE

Mississippi

COLBY
No we were going to turn them on

COLBY

VINCE

Colby and Vince simultaneously turn their keys Nothing
happens

VINCE (CONTD)
Wait Do I turn to the left or the
right

Off Colbys frustration
BACK TO
INT TARANTULAS COMPOUND - CONTINUOUS
Buff sprints toward the crane Before the Assistant
controlling Steve can react Buff activates the
electromagnet Steve is hoisted into the air and held fast
by the magnet Buff jumps out of the crane and walks toward
the Assistant who shrieks and runs away
BACK TO
INT DETONATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Colby now stands arms outstretched holding both keys He
tries desperately to reach both keyholes at the same time
Vince pouts nearby
VINCE
(whiny )

COLBY

So now youll sit there and I will

do it
Suddenly the door flies off its hinges and Buff bursts in

COLBY (CONTD)
What How is this possible

The Forty Thousand Dollar Man 98

BUFF
Lets just say Steve Austin has a
magnetic personality

COLBY
You used the magnet out there

Buff nods
COLBY (CONT’D)

VINCE

Buff reaches into the water and pulls out a dripping ring
box He opens it and shows her a diamond ring

BUFF
Will you marry me Lady Soldier

BONNIE
Oh Buff Of course I will

He puts the ring on her finger She admires it for a beat
then a shadow crosses her face

The Forty Thousand Dollar Man 101
