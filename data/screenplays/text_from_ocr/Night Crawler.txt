LOU
Don’t rush you Okay Good I can use

school of fish or say even a professional
hockey team for example these experts
have identified communication as the

LOU

NINA
Yeah What

LOU circling the news set taking it in as he talks

LOU
Well all sorts of things actually I’m
on my computer all day I haven’t had
what you’d call much formal education but
you can find most anything if you look
hard enough Last year I took an on-line
business course for example I learned
you have to have a business plan before
starting a business and that why you
pursue something is as important as what
you pursue The site advised you to
answer the following question before
deciding where to focus your abilities
The question was ‘What do I love to do’
The site suggested making a list of my
strengths and weaknesses What are you
good at And what are you not that good
at Maybe you want to strengthen and
develop knowledge about the things you’re
already good at Or maybe you might want
to strengthen your weaknesses I
recently remade my list and I’m thinking
now that television news might just be
something that I love as well as
something that I happen to be good at

REPORTEROVER
This sleepy Westchester lane erupted in
gunfire at approximately 120 last night
with sheriffs deputies telling KWLA
that over 30 shots were exchanged in a
shootout that left two unidentified but
alleged drug users dead in the foreclosed
home behind me But the horror was only
beginning inside the neighboring house
where Robert and Cathy Cahill were left
frantically checking their baby daughter
for injuries after the barrage shattered
the safety as well as their windows and
rooms with high-caliber bullets

The inside of the couple’s house is seen money shot of
the family photo on the bullet-pierced fridge

REPORTEROVER
Police investigators are now mounting a
massive search for the gunmen with one
senior official telling KWLA that it
was a miracle innocent victims werent
injured or killed in the shootout That
official also conveyed concern for the
very real possibility of more gunplay in
other LA neighborhoods urging all
Southland residents to exercise caution
by locking their doors and windows

LOU
Thanks for coming out to talk The place
I’m in now is that I want a relationship
with somebody I can team up with and
share like we share the same hours the
same job and whatnot I could go down a
laundry list but you get the idea

NINA
I hope you find someone

LOU
Here’s the thing about that Nina I’m
quite certain that I already have

NINA
Okay let me put this politely I only
came out to dinner with you Lou purely
as a professional courtesy

LOU
Thank you because I don’t think it’s a
secret that I’ve single-handedly raised
the unit price on your ratings book

NINA
Our ratings book price

LOU
I’m a very fast learner Nina We had a
conversation and I specifically mentioned
that Do you remember Well do you

NINA
Yes

LOU
I recently learned for instance that
most Americans watch local news to stay
informed I also learned that an average
half-hour of Los Angeles television news
packs all its local government coverage --
including budget law enforcement
education transportation and immigration
-- into 22 seconds Local crime stories
however not only usually led the news
but filled 14 times the broadcast
averaging 5 minutes 7 seconds And
KWLA relies heavily on such stories
With Los Angeles crime rates going down I
think that makes items like mine
particularly valuable like rare animals
I imagine your needs will only increase
during next week’s rating sweeps period
THE

WRAP

NINA
We certainly appreciate what you do

LOU
Theres certain good things in being
alone You have time to do the things
you want to do like study and plan But
you can’t have dinners like this Or be
physical with a person I mean beyond a
flirtationship

NINA
Where are you going with this

LOU
I want that With you Like you want to
keep your job and your health insurance

NINA
Look just for starters I don’t need you
to keep my fucking job

LOU
You’re the news director on the vampire
shift at the lowest rated station in LA
I have to think you’re invested in this
transaction

NINA
Where did you get the balls to even
suggest something like this

LOU
We’re still talking

NINA

There’s nothing more to say
LOU

You can leave
NINA

You’ve done well Okay We pay you
well Very well We always have If
you like I can get you an exclusive
retainer that would be on top of your
segment fees I could maybe even get you
a job at the station starting as a
production assistant so you can learn
the business from the inside that’s
where you said your interests lie see
where it goes

THE

WRAP ua

LOU

You’re not listening Nina I happen to
know you haven’t stayed at one station
for more than two years at a time and
you’re coming up on two years soon So I
can imagine you have a contract for that
length of time and that ratings during
the next week will directly affect that

NINA
You’re threatening if I don’t

LOU
I’m negotiating

NINA
You’re threatening to stop selling to me

LOU
That’s your choice The true price of
any item is what someone’s willing to
pay You want something and I want you

NINA
To fuck you

NINAOVER EAR-PIECE
They escaped They’re on the loose

And that is the first of what we
understand are three bodies in the home

suspects who at this time are believed to
have escaped Who are still out there
And thats a very frightening thought

Repeat that

ANCHORMAN
Its very concerning particularly given
the savagery of what were seeing and
that looks to be the kitchen where you
can see another body on the floor and
again I want to repeat because it bears
repeating that the person or people who
committed this brutal home invasion
robbery are presently unidentified and at

You said we were waiting for a better
neighborhood with more people not a
fucking crowded restaurant

LOU
We work with what we’re given

LOU hands RICK a small camcorder

LOU
You’re going to go around and get an
angle inside from those dumpsters over
there Steady hands use the zoom and
no fast pans I’11 be filming from here

RICK
Fuck that I’m not leaving the car

LOU
I want a second angle from behind the
dumpsters We can cut them together
Two angles Believe me it’s more
dangerous here in the car

RICK
I don’t believe anything you say This
is fucked

LOU

Do you know I’ve never once cursed in
front of an employer

RICK
I’m not going out there I’m not doing
it

LOU

You’re making a mistake

RICK
I don’t care about my fucking title

LOU
What if my problem wasn’t that I don’t
understand people but that I don’t like
them What if I was the kind of person
who was obliged to hurt you for this I
mean physically I think you’d have to
believe afterward if you could that
agreeing to participate and then backing
out at the critical moment was a mistake
Because that’s what I’m telling you as
clearly as I can

THE

WRAP

DETECTIVE FRONTEIRI
Would you tell me how it is you were at
the Chinatown Express tonight and called
in the 911

LOU
Of course I’m happy to It began
earlier in the day I was watering my
plant and I looked out my window at my
apartment the one you visited and I saw
a dark colored car with two men parked
across the street I didn’t think much
about it otherwise I would have reported
it then We began our night my employee
and myself and around approximately
1238 I looked in the rear view mirror
and saw that we were being followed by
what looked to be the same men in the
same car I made an evasive maneuver
circled back and tailed them to the
Wendy’s at which time I witnessed them
go inside and I recognized them as the
men from the home invasion

DETECTIVE FRONTEIRI
You told me you didn’t see the men that
you didn’t get a good look at them

LOU
Well it came back to me when I saw them
going in Their shapes and their
movements Then I saw that one of them
had a gun under his shirt and so of
course I immediately got my phone and I
called 911

DETECTIVE FRONTEIRI
And started filming

LOU
Exactly That’s what I do

DETECTIVE FRONTEIRI
That’s your story

LOU
That’s what happened That’s why I’m
here talking to you I think they
tracked me down after seeing my footage

THE

WRAP

DETECTIVE FRONTEIRI
Would you like to know what I think

LOU
Yes please

DETECTIVE FRONTEIRI
I think you withheld information I
think you saw the two men at the murder
house in Granada Hills and you saw the
car and you sat on it to start something
you could film What do you think about
that

LOU
I think it would be very unprofessional
for someone to do that in my business

DETECTIVE FRONTEIRI
It would be murder

LOU
I can understand why you’re looking into
it but I didn’t do anything like that
nothing that could be considered wrong

DETECTIVE FRONTEIRI
You left the scene of an accident

LOU
I wasn’t involved in the accident I
avoided it and stopped

DETECTIVE FRONTEIRI
You don’t fool me for a minute

LOU
I’m glad

DETECTIVE FRONTEIRI
I think everything you’ve said is a lie

LOU
I wish my partner was here to support
what happened

DETECTIVE FRONTEIRI
Your dead partner

LOU
That’s right

THE

WRAP

DETECTIVE FRONTEIRI
You left your dead partner

LOU
The ambulances had arrived They’re
