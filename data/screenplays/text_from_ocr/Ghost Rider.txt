A COYOTE lopes through shimmering heat waves The sky above
is a cloudless blue

WOMAN (VO)

My Father used to say that the only way
Evil came into your life was if you
invited it Im not sure about that at
least not anymore What I cLQ know is
this we are born alone and we die
alone and what happens in between is all
that matters The choices we make the
people whose paths we cross -- these are
the things that determine our fate

The coyote ducks through a hole in a chain-link fence

through the rusted ruins of a --

DERELICT AMUSEMENT PARK

Broken-down rides weed-clogged machinery sideshow trailers
bleached bone-white

WOMAN (V0) (CONTD)

Most stories start with a beginning His
began with an ending I never knew where
he really came from I guess its not
important anymore All I know is that
hed been running his entire life
Running for so long that he no longer
new whether he was running away from

SOMETHING --

Southwestern town

STARKE
You look like you could use some help
Blaze glances at the troopers Theyre still completely
unaware of Starkes presence Its as if Starke and Blaze
have somehow stepped a split-second sideways in time
The lights around them continue to dim The second hand on
the wall clock stops An eerie dreamlike moment -- the

the rain the tree branches tapping against the window pane

Something about Starkes eyes Commanding and haunting at

Alive Evil Aflame A man but not a man -- an impossible
spectre engulfed in fire its skullish head deeply bowed
Clinking coils of red-hot chain slip link by link through

skeletal flickering fingers Then it lifts his terrible
HEAD --

Skeletal aflame but somehow still Johnny his tortured
visage recognizable even as the furnace blazes blue-white
His jaw bone pivots open to unleash an INHUMAN HOWL at once
predatory and tormented a shriek of eternal damnation

accelerates from zero to sixty in a heartbeat

Lloyd runs fast as he can Talk about pointless The Ghost
Rider seizes his head drags him seventy yards burning him

shudders eyes bulging All he can do is stare into those
awful pits fall into them as grisly IMAGES from his evil
past spark and shred into his melting mind
Every act of violence every crime he ever committed --
beatings murders acts of torture and revenge -- are now
revisited upon Fusco tenfold This is the PENANCE STARE and
Fusco is feeling its full hellish force The Ghost Rider
and Fusco SCREAM in sync
Carrigan and Rain cant look away They stand transfixed --
Then its over The Ghost Rider drops Fusco into the mud
He lies there shuddering glassy-eyed burned black but
still alive his brain irrevocably overloaded
And The Ghost Rider is somehow different too Immobile
Internal Then he looks up past Carrigan Rrht at Rain
Rain stares back But its --

BLAZES FACE
she SEES An abject abyss of pain and shame and torment
replaced

And Rains terror is forgotten for just that moment
with something best described as empathy

out of nowhere slamming into him at sixty plus

INSIDE THE CAB

LANDSDALE ducks the shattering windshield leaps from the
truck as it fills with fire --

The Tundra keeps moving pile-drives the howling spectre
square into a massive boulder The truck compresses like an
accordion EXPLODES engulfs the rock with fire --
Landsdale picks himself up ready for anything Carrigan
tugs Rain over The wreckage burns out of control

down watches uncomprehending The crumpled truck is hurled
aside Two tons Tipped over like a packing crate
Nomi slips down into the gully gasping with fear HEAVY
FOOTSTEPS and CRACKLING FIRE draw near --
Nomi dares to look up The Ghost Rider stares down at her
Like Death itself Imagine yourself face to face with a
Great White an unfathomable impenetrable force of nature -

Then imagine that force turning away sparing you The world
exhales After a moment Nomi dares to look again

Because its his nature
Laforte elaborates Nomi continues to translate

Long ago Coyote could change his shape
chop his body into little pieces causing

saw Coyote for what he really was So he
swooped down scattered those pieces to

The first men they found the pieces and
not knowing what they were they ate
them And thats how all men came to
have a little piece of Coyote in their
hearts Now Coyote hell promise
anything to get those pieces back

Geez Im sorry youre absolutely right
Thats the Caddy rate Guess I entered

Starke looks up at Petrowsky over the rim of his bifocals
the timbre of his voice taking on a decidedly frigid turn

STARKE
Were you trying to cheat me Jim

PETROWSKY
No no not at all --

STARKE
Then Id like a new contract specifying
the appropriate rate
Petrowsky squirms uncomfortable For in that pregnant
moment without either participant uttering at word the
entire nature of the transaction seems to have changed

Never thought Id be back here
They pass cautiously through the front yard Nomis pickup
is parked nearby The front door bangs back and forth Nomi
pulls a revolver from her waist-band

something He shuts his eyes opens them --

BLAZES POV (THE PAST)

the face The silent moment is caught in motion so slow its
virtually a tableau

A statement not a question She nods

Nomi hesitates not wanting to relive this

NOMI
I was dying Id shot myself full of
Billys best gear Figured Id teach him
a lesson and go out in style
Blaze nods but he doesnt see Nomi now He SEES --

BLAZES POV (THE PAST)
-- Nomi as she waS An inch away from eternity She is
lying on the bed staring upwards shallow breaths- Above
her a MOTH flutters by a light casting distorted shadows

BLAZE (VO)
But it felt like a mistake

NOMI ON THE BED

(WHISPERS)
I dont want to die

The lights begin to dim We hear FOOTSTEPS approaching
muted and distorted A SHADOW falls across Nomi --

STARKE
stands above her There are OTHER SHADOWS drifting in behind
him Things better left half-glimpsed Coyotes Beasts

He smiled and said --
As Starke starts to speak we hear

and it always lands the same side up I
keep thinking -- ona time one time Im
going to spin it and Ill see the other
face Sleep through the night without
getting blood on my hands But it never
happens

(SHAKING)
Theres always some sad motherfucker out
there that needs retribution vengeance --

Blaze flings the coin away in disgust It spins wobbles
lands coyote side up He laughs tiredly then looks away
lost suddenly overcome with emotion

Nomi moves to his side struggles to help him up

Here why dont you lie down for a little
while
Blaze nods too tired to argue Nomi half carries him to the
bed lowers him down Blaze settles back exhausted Nomi
watches him holding vigil His eyes grow heavy He shuts
them a moment opens them again --

over to face him smiles sleepily Blaze reaches for her
touches her face -- and the moment shatters into violence

As Blaze stands we SEE that his wounds have healed-He
shrugs on a shirt approaches Nomi nods to the paper
wedding band

BLAZE

fuck-ups weve perpetrated on the world

Blaze and Rhymer are cleaning up

BLAZE
Listen I appreciate what youre trying
to do but Ive never really been a come
to Jesus kind of guy

RHYMER
I wasnt talking about Jesus I was
talking about a little healthy
introspection Working here staying in
one place for a while seeing what
surfaces Ive found that people tend to
arrive on our doorstep for a reason
Blaze considers this formidable man a yearning moment
then he shakes his head

BLAZE
I cant stay Im sorry

RHYMER
What about the girl then Whatever
youre involved in I cant imagine its
good for her well-being
(beat gentle)
We can find a home for her

BLAZE

(UNSURE)
also

Id have to leave tonight --

Rhymer nods understanding he motions towards a beautiful
motorcycle parked back in the shadows -- a °71 Norton
Commando 850 Black with gold pin-striping

RHYMER
You can take the Norton

BLAZE
I dont have any money

RHYMER
So send us some when you do
Blaze is moved by this mans simple humanity -- but hes

wrestling with the idea of abandoning Rain
CUT TO
EXT MISSION - DUSKNIGHT

TIME-LAPSING SHADOWS cross the mission buildings and the
surrounding wilderness landscape The lonely scarecrow
stares button-eyed and blank

INT MISSION - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Blaze gazes into a bathroom mirror Been here so many times
before SOUNDS intrude upon his solitude

He bows his head studies the coin turning it over in his
shaking fingers The malicious coyote the soaring eagle
Still the SOUNDS come stronger more insistent --

Cars CRASHING Police SIRENS wailing SCREAMS GUNFIRE

FLAMES

Blaze looks up once more His eyes are shadowed sockets
This is the real PENANCE STARE and Blaze is feeling its
awful mournful ache

NOMIS VOICE
He wants to know if youre a bad man
He wants to know -- if the Ghost Rider
turned its penance stare on you would
you burn
Blaze clenches his fist around the coin spins on his heels

INT MISSION - DORM ROOM - NIGHT

Blaze pauses in the doorway looking in on Rain who sleeps
dead to the world Blaze sets the coyote coin on the bed
table next to her turns and leaves

We HOLD ON Rains sleeping face for a beat then she stirs
opening her eyes She SEES the coin nearby sits up

INT MISSION - STORM CELLAR - NIGHT

The Norton Commando ROARS into life blasting webs from the
exhaust Blaze guides the bike up the coal ramp and out
through the open cellar doors

EXT MISSION - NIGHT

A STORM FRONT is moving in huge thunderheads gathering and
roiling Blaze pulls a dusty skid pauses with the engine
RUMBLING Looks back forlornly at the mission Then he
wrings the throttle and hauls away into the night as we --

ANGLE ON A DORM ROOM WINDOW
Rain stands at the glass watching Blaze leave

CUT TO
INT MISSION - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Rhymer and leads his wards in prayer We can hear the WIND
rising outside gathering in strength

RHYMER
That which was from the beginning which
we have heard which we have seen with
our eyes which we have looked upon and
our hands have handled of the Word of
life

INT MISSION - HALLWAY - NIGHT

MOVING WITH Rain down a moonlit corridor- She clutches the
coyote coin like a talisman then ---

SEES SOMETHING
through a window which startles her -- only to realize that
its just the scarecrow out in the field flapping wildly

the

THE MEN (VO)

For the life was manifested and we have
seen it and bear witness and shew unto
you that eternal life which was with the
Father and was manifested unto us

INT MISSION - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

RHYMER CONTINUES

RHYMER
That which we have seen and heard
declare we unto you that ye also may
have fellowship with us and truly our
fellowship is with the Father and with
his Son Jesus Christ And these things
write we unto you that your joy may be
full This then is the message which we
have heard of him and declare unto you
that God is light --

CUT TO
EXT COASTAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT
Blaze rides like the wind along a snaking road
storm clouds churning behind him

RHYMER (V0)
-- and in him is no darkness at all

UP AHEAD

away from

the land falls sharply away spilling down into a wide
expanse of moonlit ocean pregnant with the promise of

release

Cut TO
INT MISSION - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Rhymer and his men eat Rain is there too Nunez peers out
into the darkness Wind and debris are scratching at the
window panes We hear THUNDER now too

NUNEZ
Padre Youd better take a look at this
Rhymer joins him SEES what he SEES COYOTES gathering Six
or more They creep malevolently towards the mission

NUNEZ (CONTD)
You ever see anything like that before

Rhymer shakes his head looks to --

RAIN
Shes acutely conscious of the men staring at her now still
clutching the coin like a rabbits foot

TOLBEIN
Its her -- shes the one doing this

RHYMER
Thats enough Richard

TOLBEIN
Im telling you Father theres
something wrong with --
CRASH One of the windows SLAMS open startling everyone
Rhymer moves to it latches it shut again

INT MISSION - ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT

LIGHTNING flashes An eerie HOWLING arises Tolbein and
Nunez lead some men to the front door Tolbein unbars the
door pulls it open cant believe his eyes THREE DOZEN
HOWLING COYOTES approaching the entrance
SHOUTING

TOLBEIN
What is this
SCARE A snarling coyote comes out of left field just
misses his throat --
Tolbein leaps backward SLAMS the door The men start
SHOUTING Rain backs away She knows whats happening
WHAM An animal rams the door Then another And another --

INT MISSION - RHYMERS OFFICE - NIGHT

Rhymer breaks out a shotgun shells hears the men

INT MISSION - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Rhymer rushes in The men are confused afraid WHAM
WHAM GROWLING coyotes are hurling themselves repeatedly
against the windows cracking the panes

RHYMER
Get away from the windows

(TO WILSON)
Wilson take Rain to the chapel

Wilson hesitates eyeing Rain with distrust-

WILSON
I aint going nowhere with her
All the men are giving Rain a wide berth now WHAM Another
snarling coyote hits the glass

RHYMER
One of you please just take the kid to
the chapel

TOLBEIN

Father thats the last place she should
be
CRUNCH Something strikes the room a massive blow
Something MUCH BIGGER than a coyote Viscott starts praying

NUNEZ
Quiet Viscott
THUMP CRUMP More heavy blows Like the Fist of God
Making the floorboards beneath their feet vibrate SOMETHING
shambles past the window What in Gods name was that

TOLBEIN
(looking at Rain accusing)
I knEw we shouldve sent them away
THOOM Another impact THOOMTHOOM Plaster cracks Dust
falls Viscott wails praying even more stridently Nunez
is losing it

NUNEZ
SHUT THE FUCK UP MAN

TOLBEIN
Shes the one they want Im telling you
-- and the lights abruptly go ou The storm bellows and
blusters The men huddle together fear thick and sour

CARRIGAN (0S)

Raainn -- Raaaaiinnn --
A gastly VOICE monstrously corrupt but still recognizable
as Billy-Ray Carrigan

CARRIGAN (OS) (CONTD)
-- where are you Rainnnnnnn

Rain shrinks away from the insidious mewling

TOLBEIN

(to Rhymer hissing)
I told you --
gap

Even Rhymer is shaken now He moves to investigate presses
up against a cracked window --

RHYMERS POV (THROUGH WINDOW)

Carrigan stands outside lurching between patterns of
moonlight and shadow But the movement is all wrong And in
our momentary glimpses of him we get the sense that hes
been horribly changed -- as if his body had been torn apart
hen haphazardly reassembled into something else

RUNCH The wall fractures Rhymer staggers back WHUMP
RUNCH A row of impacts moves along the wall --

olbein and Nunez scramble to reach the dining room door
hey close it turning the locks

HANG Carrigan slams against the other side of the heavy
teel door WHANGWHANG Again and again and again The

en are terrified SHOUTING at each other The door is
uckling inward the hinges bending and GROANING --

hen the pummelling stops Just the sound of BREATHING
halting and phlegmatic No one moves not a whisper
CORROSION starts to spread across the metal door

HoBustysis aad

NUNEZ
What the fuck --
Rhymer edges close to the decaying door peering through a

in the frame --
Carrigan peers back moonlight illuminating his face There
are buttons where his eyes should 12P He BELLOWS

CARRIGAN

PRIEST GIVE ME THE GIRL
The POUNDING begins anew harder now The weakened door is
surely about to give way Rain is terrified

TOLBEIN
Do what he says Put her out

RHYMER
Get back with the others

oottina

TOLBEIN
We dont do what it says that thing
outside theres gonna kill us all
Rhymer steps in front of Rain levels his shotgun at
Tolbeins chest

RHYMER
God as my witness Richard lay a hand on
that girl and I will pull this trigger
Tolbein hesitates -- then grabs at the shotgun He twists it
from Rhymers hands SMASHES the butt across Rhymers jaw
Rhymer sinks to the floor
Tolbein grabs Rain drags her SCREAMING to the door He
waves the shotgun at the others --

TOLBEIN
Open the fucking door DO IT
Nunez fumbles with the lock Rhymer recovers throws himself
at Nunez tries stop him from opening it The pounding
ceases All eyes sweep to the door --

TWO BUTTONS
roll through the gap between the bottom of the door and the
floor coming to rest at Rhymers feet -- immediately

the floorboards beneath them

CARRIGAN (0S)

(a skin-crawling whisper)

I can see you Priest I can see every
last one of you

THE DOOR BURSTS OPEN
knocking Tolbein Rain Rhymer and Nunez on their asses All
eyes bug as Carrigan shoulders his way inside Only hes

Carrigan anymore Now hes --

THE SCARECROW
A golem of dessicated flesh knitted together with straw and
sodden burlap pieces of insects twine and razor wire
Button-socket eyes Jagged bone teeth Beetle-black chitin
for fingers and nails
His very existence is an affront to nature Everything the
Scarecrow touches instantly corrodes and decays Floorboards
rot metal rusts Every movement every spastic shudder and
twitch is a source of incalculable pain

The Scarecrow thrusts his hand out and a STORM OF DEMONIC
CROWS explodes from his chest whirling about like a cyclone
of knives
Now the coyotes enter too Dozens of them SNARLING DIVING
at the men sinking their jaws into flesh

The men are trapped Some try to flee Others fight back
swinging chairs and planks --

THE SCARECROW
stalks into their midst snaring victims left and right
HURLING bodies or pulling them apart --
He snatches Viscott up by his throat Bugs swarm over the
SCREAMING parolees face as it rots and decays In seconds
Viscotts entire body decomposes putrefies falls apart --

RHYMER AND RAIN

back up towards the kitchen SCREECH A crow-thing comes
flapping Rhymer FIRES The creature SHRIEKS and flops --
Nunez claws another from his face SEES its not a crow at
all but some kind of wriggling eyeless monstrosity with a
deformed razor beak matted feathers bony talons --
Wilson trapped under a bench BEATS desperately at a
gnashing coyote Lands a real blow The beast falls back
then stands up like a man

VARIOUS ANGLES
as the OTHER COYOTES do likewise The coyotes are changing
shape enlarging canine skeletons CRACKING and re-arranging
themselves into --

JAW-BEASTS
The same half-glimpsed horrors we glimpsed accompanying
Starke All muscle and gnashing fangs and bloody ripping
claws

CUT TO
EXT COASTAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Blaze rolls the Norton to a stop Kills the engine Sits
cursed

earth

back in the saddle and drinks in the night
The moonlit landscape is profoundly silent the starry sky
clear and awesome Nothing stirs

Not a cricket not a lizard Just the moonlit expanse of
ocean below Then we hear THUNDER like distant artillery
Blaze looks back over his shoulder --

BLAZES POV
Distant thunderheads LIGHTNING flickering
CLOSE ON Blaze trying to drive Rain from his mind We can
SEE on his face that its a losing battle -- for poor

Johnny Blaze has finally understood his purpose on this

CUT TO
INT MISSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Claws and jaws and razor-beaks tearing frenziedly through
wood and plaster and lathe Rhymer Rain Nunez and Tolbein
struggle to repel the monsters beating them back with
whatever is at hand --

-- but the jaw-beasts and razor birds are winning forcing
their way into the kitchen --

Nunz is snagged Slashing claws swarm all over him The
others try to pull him free --

Rhymer wastes two more precious SHOTS but Nunez is lost
Dragged SCREAMING into the storm of mouths and claws The
survivors fall back as the door gives and --

THE SCARECROW
pitches through the opening lurching forward Jaw-beasts
fall in behind him Razor birds whirl around his head
The survivors scramble for the far exit Rain opens every
gas burner on the grill as she passes by -- but the far exit
is locked And Rhymer doesnt have the key
BOOM Rhymer shotguns the lock The lock fractures but the
exit still wont open Tolbein starts kicking Rhymer aims
AGAIN --
RAIN

(tugging at Rhymer)
Shoot the gas

RHYMER

advances Bugs swarm from beneath his tattered feet Every
metal implement and surface rusts as he passes

RAIN

SHOOT THE GAS

Rhymer hears the ranges HISSING and FIRES CHOOM The gas
fireballs catches Scarecrow full-on sideways He squeals
reels Burning jaw-beasts writhe and howl

Rain falls to the floor dropping the coyote coin It spins
furiously as we --

CUT TO
EXT COASTAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Blaze Coming back Ninety One hundred Wind tears
wildly at his hair jacket The bike shudders The
tachometer edges upwards --

One twenty One twenty-five Nitrous booster The Norton
SCREAMS One thirty One forty One fifty --

HEAT streams off Blaze FLAMES wisp from his nostrils One
sixty One seventy

The tachometer SHATTERS The engine smokes The bike
SHRIEKS pushing the edge of mechanical reason
FLAMES explode from Blazes mouth and eyes His hands
ignite He CRIES OUT in agony His body alters violently
His face warps Bones crack and shift Flesh shrinks and
tightens as the skull-visage emerges

The bike changes too red heat spreading throughout
Tortured metal SCREECHES Straining machinery pops and
bulges Shafts lengthen into skeletal bones The saddle
slouches The tank distends --

WHOOMPF The wheels ignite then the whole bike HELLFIRE
streams an extension of Blazes rage

Blaze SCREAMS from the pit of his soul as the Ghost Rider
claws itself into being more manifest that ever before --
And thats when the bike really accelerates -

-- so fast that its air wake churns the dust on each side

so fast that molten asphalt spumes from behind like lava
-- so fast that the goddamn camera can barely catch it and -

B-BOOM The hellcycle breaks MACH 1 SONIC BOOMS rocking
the landscape as we --

CUT TO
INT MISSION - NIGHT

-- the Scarecrow savagely burnt by the blast but
unstoppable He rises cocks his head hears something --

VARIOUS ANGLES - DINING ROOM KITCHEN STAIRCASE

The jaw-beasts The razor birds All pause All listen

They know somethings coming Something fast Something bad
We hear it now too -- the WHINE of an APPROACHING ENGINE

ON THE COYOTE COIN

wobbling to a stop coyote side up

Realizing whats about to happen the Scarecrow lets loose a
GHASTLY WAIL and --

THE GHOST RIDER
erupts through the wall in DEEP SLOW MOTION sending forth a
majestic tsunami of fire and debris The monster bike skids
carves floorboards like matchwood --

JAW-BEASTS AND RAZOR BIRDS

hurl themselves out of its scorching path --

The Ghost Rider vaults from the saddle sends the bike
spinning at the scurrying monsters It ninepins a few takes
out the rest as it impacts the wall like a nuke --

THE CROW-THINGS
are vanquished squealing and flopping like living cinders

BUT THE JAW-BEASTS RECOVER

still aflame but very much alive If anything they seem
emboldened by the fire They circle the Ghost Rider more
and more of them joining the pack

THE GHOST RIDER

readies his chains The jaw-beasts attack Three dozen
horrors pouncing and GNASHING The Ghost Rider takes them-
Chains flames sheer power and force --

Spines snap Lupine skulls burn The Ghost Rider tears the
monsters limb from limb The room becomes the Seventh Circle
of Hell and at the heart of the Inferno the Ghost Rider
exults in the slaughter --

The whole mission is ablaze now fire and churning smoke
consuming everything in its path Rhymer Rain and Tolbein
run for their lives

INT MISSION - DORMITORY - NIGHT

Rain Rhymer and Tolbein are trapped Fire has cut them off
They back their way towards the rear of the building peer
out the windows --

THEIR POV
a hundred foot drop straight down to the highway
skeletal

OF

TOLBEIN
Theres no way down from here
CRACK The door behind them splinters The Scarecrows
found them once again

INT MISSION - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

The Ghost Rider is having difficulty with the jaw-beasts
His fire burns them but they just keep coming -- blackened
skeletal demons possessed of an unstoppable ferocity --
For every one he throws aside two more seem to take its
place He can wound them sear the flesh from their bones
but still they pile on sinking their teeth into his

flesh CRUNCHING through his hollow rib-cage --

The Ghost Rider SHRIEKS in pain TEARS one from his back
SNAPS anothers spine PUNCHES a fist through a thirds
gnashing muzzle He falls back through a doorway onto --

A STAIRCASE
And still they attack And now the Ghost Rider is
weakening He stumbles on the steps falls to his knees
The fiends pile atop his back --

Summoning all his power the Ghost Rider emits a SHOCKWAVE

FLAME a HEAT-BOMB that blasts the creatures clean off him
INT MISSION - DORMITORY - NIGHT

The SHOCKWAVE shakes the room FIRE belches through the
splintered doorway --

-- but the Scarecrow scarcely notices Hes flinging dorm

beds left and right HOWLING and GROANING as he hunts for --

SCARECROW

RAAAAINNN RAAINN
The Scarecrow hurls aside a bed and finds Tolbein He
reaches for the man sinking his spindly fingers into
Tolbeins chest Tolbein SCREAMS instantly shrivelling
corroding into dust --
The Scarecrow hurls aside yet another bed and finds --

RHYMER
aiming his shotgun point-blank range BLAM The BLAST
Takes a chunk out of the Scarecrows face

INT MISSION - THE STAIRS - THAT MOMENT

All Hell breaks loose The Ghost Rider unleashes wave after
wave of HELLFIRE incinerating the hounds as they leap
towards him fighting his way up and up the steps --

INT MISSION - DORMITORY - NIGHT

BLAM Another BLAST chews apart the Scarecrows neck The
monstrosity staggers then lurches forward grabbing the
barrel of the shotgun instantly corroding it --

The wave of corrosion swarms up the stock while towards
Rhymers hands and he drops the gun rolling away scooping
up Rain as he runs towards the bathroom --

BACK TO THE SCARECROW
recovering his makeshift flesh knitting itself back

Flames kiss his body causing sodden particles on his frame
SIZZLE and POP -- but because his decayed flesh is so wet
never ignites

Enkindled BUZZING bug-ember things swirl around the
Scarecrows head in a halo impossibly alive- He stumbles
after Rhymer and Rain into

THE BATHROOM
A claustrophobic box of stalls and urinals Rhymer and Rain
are nowhere to be seen Enraged the Scarecrow tears into
the stalls ripping them aside one by one --

INT MISSION - THE STAIRS - THAT MOMENT

The Ghost Rider advances hurling jaw-beasts left and right

INT MISSION - BATHROOM - NIGHT

The Scarecrow rends the last stall asunder finds Rain and
Rhymer cowering like bugs He looms above Rain beetle-
fingers clutching flashing a rotted rictus-grin --

SCARECROW
-- GOT YOU

RED-HOT CHAINS
whip viciously around the Scarecrows sodden head and torso
Hes wrenched backwards hauled out of the bathroom and
SLAMMED across the dormitory into the opposite wall --

EXT MISSION - NIGHT

The wall fractures Debris falls tumbling hundreds of feet
down to the highway below

INT MISSION - DORMITORY - NIGHT

The Scarecrow recovers SEES the room ablaze SEES a swathe
of blackened twitching jaw-beast skeletons leading from the
doorway to --

THE GHOST RIDER
At the other end of the chains More accurately

GHOST BLAZE

battered and weakened staggering His flames are barely
flickering his bony flesh has become chalky and brittle
Hes holding a jaw-beast skeleton drops it to the floor --
The Scarecrow attacks Hand-to-hand combat Massive blows
and blocks The burning room SHUDDERS with each impact --

now

completely

Ghost Blaze uses his chains but hes weak and Scarecrow
turns them back on him SMASHES him against the walls More
structural fractures more dust --

EXT MISSION - NIGHT

The whole mission quakes A huge hole in the wall falls
open the Scarecrow barely manages to stop himself falling
The stilt-like support columns bearing the weight of the
overhanging mission begin to CREAK and bend Some snap --

INT MISSION - DORMITORY - NIGHT

The dormitory drops alarmingly ten feet or more the
flooring canting precariously Ghost Blaze stumbles falls -

WHAM Scarecrow grabs Ghost Blazes neck Squeezes tight
A WAVE OF DECAY AND CORROSION spreads over Ghost Blaze He
SCREAMS his flesh putrefying but Scarecrow will not let go

ON RAIN AND RHYMER
Desperate for escape the flames closing in on them Theres
nowhere to go Except a small HATCH high up in the ceiling

BACK TO SCENE

Ghost Blaze HOWLS in agony as the Scarecrows superior evil
dominates He feebly extends a hand towards the flames
nearby trying to compel the fire to him The flames twist
briefly bend in his direction The Ghost Rider HOWLS with
frustration He needs the flames He will die without them
He tries again reaching reaching --

THE FLAMES
surrounding the two foes are starting to bend in earnest

streaming towards Ghost Blazes bony begging fingertips
The Scarecrow is oblivious Just keeps pouring more misery
into Ghost Blazes body as --

EXT MISSION - NIGHT

-- the entire mission which was only moments ago
FIRE-

aflame is now extinguishing itself An inferno in
retrograde roiling inward --

INT MISSION - VARIOUS - NIGHT
-- raging flames bend and draw long --

-- clouds of embers are pulled into coursing streams---
-- roiling fireballs are dragged wildly from walls floors
and ceilings --
-- flame and fury funneling thunderously into SCORCHING

SPOUTS that cyclone up and up and up into --
INT MISSION - DORMITORY - NIGHT

-- Ghost Blaze from every direction

Suddenly Scarecrow finds himself at the heart of a back-
drafting firestorm a sustained implosion feeding straight
into Ghost Blaze Then --

Nuclear silence

An instant in which Rhymer shoves Rain through the hatch --
An instant in which Scarecrow senses his own doom --
Because the Ghost Rider is back- But now hes more than the
Ghost Rider Hes a white-hot nuclear bomb fairly vibrating
with volcanic heat

And he DETONATES An apocalyptic release that --
obliterates Scarecrow --

sends Rhymer ducking for cover --

bulges the dormitorys fractured walls and ceiling

lifting the ATTIC FLOOR mightily HURLING Rain into the air

A FLAME TSUNAMI
steamrollers through every room and passage destroying
everything in its path consuming itself

INT MISSION - DORMITORY - NIGHT

Ghost Blaze lies GROANING at blackened ground zero Hes
split

pitching

almost human now spent Charred timbers CREAK and GROAN
around him The entire structure is on the verge of
collapse

ON RAIN
emerging from the smouldering bathroom ghostly white She
picks her way cautiously across the teetering floor Kneels
alongside Ghost Blaze --

Blazes eyes are black pits gaunt and skullish Rain casts

about finds a BURNING EMBER cups it in her hands holds

flame close to his mouth --

Ghost Blaze senses the fire breathes it in like a drowning
man Draws the flame deep into his lungs keeps drawing
until the ember is gone internalized Their eyes meet

RAIN
Are you going to die

GHOST BLAZE

(WEAKLY)
Not today
He pushes up on his elbows tiredly rises to his feet and -

THE MISSION

Topples Ghost Blaze and Rain run -- but theyre not going
to make it The whole room is dropging away at their heels
Ghost Blaze snatches up Rain DIVES through a widening

in the wall even as --

EXT MISSION - NIGHT

-- the dormitory folds up and slides away from them
over the hillside Breaking into TONS OF PLUNGING DEBRIS
that CRASH SPECTACULARLY onto the highway far below

ON GHOST BLAZE AND RAIN
clutching precariously to a muddy hillside Ghost Blaze
looks up SEES --

DAWN APPROACHING
first light bleeding in over the distant mountains

EXT HIGHWAY - MISSION RUINS - JUST BEFORE DAWN

Ghost Blaze strides over the smoking ruins Finds what he
was looking for --

CARRIGAN
back to human hopelessly trapped deep in the wreckage Hes
barely alive just a face in the rubble Carrigan blinks

CARRIGAN
(a ragged whisper)
who -- the fuck -- are you anyway

GHOST BLAZE
Vengeance

And Ghost Blaze raises his hand HELLFIRE trickling down the
length of his arm swirling around his hand like a building
static charge even as --

CARRIGAN
(terrified yet defiant)
Do it fucker -- dQ it

RAIN

appears on a ridge just before them eyes locking onto him
Its now or never

Ghost Blaze hesitates hesitates -- then abruptly reins the
flame back in Metabolizes the fury Pushes it down deep
RUMBLING

through sheer agony-inducing willpower Ghost Blaze
SCREAMS struggles --

-- and forces the Demon away

Now hes just Blaze weak with exertion but triumphant for
the first time in years He turns away and we --

Cut TO

EXT MISSION GROUNDS - DAWN
-- Blaze and Rain walking working their way across the
scorched grounds Rain kicks at a carbonized jaw-beast
skull It rolls SMASHES against a tree crumbles to dust
Blaze looks up just then HEARS the sound of ---

STARKES CADILLAC
It slows to a stop at the end of the drive ENGINE

Dusty and bug-begrimed from its cross-country journey
Blaze braces himself A silent inhalation of breath Rain
stares paralyzed by fear --

The drivers door opens A hulking silhouette steps out
The Beast backlit by the fiery dawn which is just breaking
over the horizon Sunlight FLARES outward briefly blinding
us And when it subsides --

STARKE
is standing there Human Windblown He raises a hand
shielding his gaze from the light Steps cowards them --

Blaze moves in front of Rain blocking Starkes path
They stand there in silence And Starke smiles eyes alight
with mischief

STARKE
Looks like weve come to the end of the
road havent we

BLAZE
Guess so
flame

After a long beat

STARKE
Give me the girl and Ill lift the curse
Blaze looks down at Rain This was all he ever wanted The
only thing that has kept him going all these years He
reaches into his jacket retrieving a crumpled pack of
cigarettes Plucks one out --

BLAZE
Shes all yours Starke --
-- and lights it without a match somehow conjuring the

from within himself He takes a long drag In the pits of
his eyes something glows there -- a kind of lambent
darkness

BLAZE (CONTD)
-- but youll have to go through me if
you want her
Starke stares into Blazes eyes Doesnt like what he SEES

STARKE
Dont be a fool Blaze Im offering you
your life back

BLAZE
Thats not a life And least now one Im
interested in living

STARKE
You think you can control it You cant

BLAZE
Guess Im willing to take my chances
Starke nods accepting defeat For now He looks down at
Rain a bitter smile creeping across his face --

beside

STARKE
You have your mothers eyes
-- and walks away
Blaze and Rain watch him retreat Presently a coyote slips
from shadows joining him on the road It--lopes along

him We watch them disappear over a rise Then theyre
gone
Beat Rain studies Blaze reaches for his hand

RAIN
Hell be back

BLAZE
Yeah

BACK AMONGST THE SMOKING RUINS

We pass broken concrete smouldering timber a rock snake
constricting a mouse an industry of beetles dissecting a
birds carcass Finally we come to a small deep cavity --
and there tucked away in the darkness we find --

WOMAN (V0)

And thats how it ended With another
beginning A kind of balance struck
between the flame and the fury

BLAZES COIN
balanced perfectly on its edge How it fell like that at
the heart of the wreckage is a mystery that will probably
never be solved

DISSOLVE TO
INT HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

A NURSE brings a postcard to a sleeping patients bedside
The patient is ROXANNE sleeping peacefully bathed in
sunlight The nurse tacks the card to a wall filled with
many -- dozens and dozens of postcards charting Blazes
journey back and forth across the country

And we realize now that Roxanne is the woman who has been
narrating our tale

ROXANNE (VO)
And me I still sleep Wandering

Waiting Listening to the whispers of
the dead

CUT TO
EXT RURAL HIGHWAY - DAYNIGHT

On Blaze riding hard as a scorching desert noon TIME-
LAPSES

into night

ROXANNE (VO)

The world turns around without me There

are sharks And there are doves And
nighttime holds far darker terrors than

death But I am never afraid because I

know that he is out there somewhere

And that someday somehow --

Blaze ignites SCREAMS hurls back his head --

ROXANNE (VO) (CONTD)
-- he will return to me
-- and the Ghost Rider rockets headlong into black

THE END
