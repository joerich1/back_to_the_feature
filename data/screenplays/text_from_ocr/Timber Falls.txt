eyelashes tremble A tear rolls out She blinks

CLOSE ON - A filthy coarse rope secures a dirty rag inside
her mouth

CLOSE ON - The same type rope binds her ankles together

CLOSE ON HER HANDS - A mixture of blood dirt IRON SPIKES
ARE NAILED THROUGH HER PALMS

FROM ABOVE - The Young Woman 20s wearing a handmade dress
with a small crest embroidered over the heart lies nailed to
a wooden table

AN OVERHEAD LIGHT BULB DIMS CRACKLES OFF SCREEN A BLOOD-
CURDLING SCREAM cries out

The Young Womans breathing intensifies She watches the
light bulb listens to the screams

The light bulb returns to normal The screams stop Peace
for a moment But she knows that wont last

2 INT TORTURE ROOM 2

A YOUNG MAN 20s hangs by his wrists from iron shackles
secured to the ceiling Hes bloodied bruised a mess

CLOSE ON - The end of a pair of jumper cables They TOUCH
sending SPARKS into the air Brought together by

A CONCEALED FIGURE All thats visible are his hands His
left hand is SEVERELY BURNED SCARRED while his right
appears normal He touches the jumper cables together
again SPARKS FLY

YOUNG MAN
Please-please stop D-dont

The Concealed Figure ignores his pleas connects the left
cable to one shackle chain and then the right side

ELECTRICITY SURGES THROUGH THE BODY OF THE YOUNG MAN HIS
BODY CONTORTS HE SCREAMS The lights DIM and CRACKLE

INT TORTURE ROOM 1

CLOSE ON - The light bulb DULLS The screams of the Young
Man echo through the room

The Young Woman closes her eyes Takes SEVERAL FAST BREATHS
then MUSTERS every ounce of strength in her body and
Her right hand TREMBLES The Young Woman GRIMACES in
unbelievable agony but then HER RIGHT HAND INCHES UP THE

RON SPIKE Slowly and painfully PIECES OF BLOOD SKIN and
BONE cling to spike as the hand moves up

The light bulb returns again to normal The screams stop

The Young Woman gives a final hard push and FREES HER
RIGHT HAND Blood pours from the wound

No time to waste She turns her attention strength to her
left hand ever-so-slowly (and painfully) it moves

INT TORTURE ROOM 2
CLOSE ON - The jumper cable attaches to the metal and
ELECTRICITY SURGES THROUGH THE YOUNG MANS body HE SCREAMS

INT CABIN - TORTURE ROOM 1

The Young Womans left hand POPS free Blood oozes out
OFF SCREEN SCREAMS FROM THE YOUNG MAN

She sits up goes for the gag but her fingers cramp in pain
Finally she unties the knot removes the gag She coughs
tries to muffle the noise best she can
The SCREAMS STOP Lights return to normal

Half way free She goes for the ropes at her ankles unties
them slides off the table She grabs a couple rags ties
them around her palms wounds

INT HALLWAY TORTURE ROOM 2

The Young Woman opens the door checks to see if the coast is
clear It is

Were at the end of a long dark hallway (more like a tunnel
really) There are two more doors in the hall one in front
of her another to her right The door across from her is
slightly ajar

YOUNG WOMANS POV THRU DOOR - The Young Man dangles from the
chains Suddenly the Concealed Figure appears between the
door and the Young Man

The Young Woman retreats but realizes the Concealed Figure
has his back to her

THE YOUNG MAN sees past the Figure LOCKS EYES with the Young
Woman No hope for himself his eyes say Save yourself

The Young Woman fights back tears mouths the words I Love
you She carefully opens the door to her right REVEAL a
rickety set of wooden steps She heads up just as

LIGHTS FLICKER OFF SCREEN The Young Man SCREAMS again

fq

The Young Woman quickens her pace The SCREAMS drown out any
sound until just before she touches THE TOP STEP

The lights return to NORMAL The Young Man STOPS screaming
The place goes silent

The Young Womans foot TOUCHES THE STEP A LOUD CREAK
RINGS OUT The Young Woman FREEZES

TORTURE ROOM 2--

The Concealed Figure TURNS towards the sound

TO

HALLWAY STAIRS--

The Young Woman holds her breath Did he hear her

A STEEL AXESICKLE hybrid (a scary handmade invention)
rusted save for the razor sharp edge sticks in a nearby

wooden horse The Concealed Figure SNATCHES the weapon

TORTURE ROOM 2--

The Concealed Figure rushes for the door In pursuit

SMASH CUT

EXT FOREST - SUNSET

SARAH races through the thick forest Her bare bloody feet
and legs stomping over the hard dirt branches shrubs
anything in her way Not too far behind

THE CONCEALED FIGURE (the majority of him still hidden)
follows her WEAPON IN HAND

SARAH pushes through some thick brush but trips
falls She SCREAMS IN PAIN grabs her foot notices A
LARGE GASH ACROSS THE BOTTOM Sarah turns hears

THE CONCEALED FIGURE approaches in the distance
SARAH wills herself up limpruns away

EXT FOREST - CLEARINGCLIFF - SUNSET

Sarah exits the thick woods to discover to her horror

STANDS AT THE EDGE OF A CLIFF takes a peek over the side

SARAHS POV - JAGGED ROCKS and a small STREAM at the bottom
200 feet below A WATERFALL flows steadily nearby

Before Sarah can fully digest the situation

THE CONCEALED FIGURE exits the forest SPINS THE WEAPON in
his hand Anticipating its use

Sarah FREEZES in her spot Breaths get shorter heavier
Her eyes dart in every direction What to do

The Concealed Figure TAKES ONE STEP FORWARD and SARAH
JUMPS OFF THE CLIFF Rather that fate than the other

The Concealed Figure walks up to the edge looks over
AT THE BOTTOM Sarahs dead body lays twisted and bloody
among the rocks The waterfall crashes next to her BLOOD

mixes with the water turning it a deep RED

head and smiles

Sheryl turns as she does Mike pinches her behind she

playfully SHRIEKS hustles away from him but he pursues her
as they both CRACK UP they spill off the trail

OFF THE PATH Mike and Sheryl continue their horseplay
when SHERYL LOOKS DOWN SCREAMS

A BLOODY MUTILATED FOX LAYS INSIDE A RUSTED BEAR TRAP The
Steel jaws of the trap have sliced the body in two The kill

signs pointing toward different trails (Donner Trail Willow
Creek Bridge Timber Falls etc)

Sheryl grabs the map and some water Mike swigs some water
munches on trail mix takes a peek in the guidebook

SHERYL
What do you think Cannibal Trail
or the other one

MIKE
Guidebook says a couple of these other

trails lead to some pretty sweet
views

SHERYL
Were not Lewis andor Clark Were
gonna stick to one of the ones the
Ranger said

IDA (OS)
You folks need some help
IDA FOSTER 40s approaches wheeling some supplies in a

handmade wagon She is worn haggard but has a friendly
smile She wears a flannel shirt old jeans and dirty boots
MIKE
Were just going over our options
here

IDA
Well take it from me any way you
choose you cant go wrong

SHERYL
The Ranger at base suggested Donner
Trail or

IDA
Willow Creek Bridge I think Sam
only knows those two trails Well
Between those Id pick Donner Trail
Willow Creek will shoot you to the
top but theres not as much to see
Donner weaves through Peddlers Point
its a better hike and prettier all
around view

SHERYL
(To Mike)
What do you think

Then she notices a ring on Sheryls finger

IDA
Thats a pretty ring

SHERYL
Thank you

IDA
Not your traditional wedding ring but
its all the same in the Lords eyes
How long have you two been wed

Sheryl and Mike trade looks
SHERYL
Oh were not married Not yet
anyway
Mike shoots her a look not yet

SHERYL
Its a ring my father gave me for
graduation

IDA

(embarrassed)
Oh Im sorry You just looked like
you was married isall Both so
beautiful

(Beat)
Im just an old fashioned silly-bird
I need to mind my own business

SHERYL
No its fine

MIKE
(changing topics)
Which one of those trails got the best
clearings

IDA

Clearings Neither will give you much
in the way of clearings But theres
another path this one here

(Points to the map)
Timber Falls Its got some beautiful
vistas and one of the prettiest falls
youll ever see

MIKE
Sounds perfect
(To Sheryl)
Yeah
IDA

Well Ill leave you to it Last
thing you need is me fussinground
you taking you from your private
time

SHERYL MIKE
Thank you Yeah thanks for the tip

Ida walks off but stops only a few feet away

IDA
Im just gonna say it and go but if
you two were to marry I bet the

Lord would bless you with a happy
healthy and handsome child Good luck
and God bless you both

Sheryl and Mike dont know how to respond Ida
Once
out of earshot

SHERYL
I suddenly feel the need for
confession

MIKE
(Still lingering on)
Not yet Love taking your shots
dont ya

Sheryl shoots him a stern but playfully sexy look

SHERYL
When I see an opening

MIKE
(Checks map)
That path she was talking about winds
through these falls What do you
think

SHERYL
I think if you get eaten by a bear
and there isnt a Ranger around Im
not carrying whats left of you down
this mountain

MIKE
And they say romance is dead
(Smiling wide)
Timber Falls it is

They throw on their backpacks and head on their way

Looking back down on the thin path FIND - Sheryl and Mike
continuing their trek (SPLINTER UNIT)

Mike maneuvers around a massive tree He freezes Gestures
for Sheryl to be quiet and mouths the words Dont Move

Sheryl stops startled Mike motions towards

A MOUNTAIN STAG with magnificent antlers chews on a plant
in the distance

Sheryl quietly slides out her digital camera Snaps a photo
of the animal

The Stag stops chewing and looks at them After a long beat
the Stag skips away through the trees

Sheryl watches the animal disappear smiles

Mike removes his backpack and crosses to Sheryl He helps
remove her backpack and kisses her She kisses him back

ANGLE ON - Sheryls heart-shaped locket through her shirt

MIKE
Youre going to lose that out here

SHERYL
Its fine I never take it off Not
since you gave it to me Betcha dont

MIKE
February 27 2006

Sheryl stares incredulously romantically at Mike
Speechless

MIKE
I remember every moment with you

SHERYL
Ive got you so whipped

They kiss Sheryl climbs onto Mikes lap He leans back
better positioning places his hand down when

MIKE
OUCH FUCK

Mike brings his hand back up BLOOD trickles out of a SMALL
CUT across his palm

SHERYL
What
MIKE
My hand Something stuck it

Sheryl quickly examines the cut Mike quickly becomes
flustered woozy He turns away from the wound

SHERYL
Its okay Its not too deep Let me
get the first aid kit

Sheryl rummages through her bag Mike in more psychological
discomfort than physical looks away wincing

Sheryl returns wipes the blood away best she can She
applies some peroxide

MIKE
Fuck That stung

SHERYL
Gotta clean the wound baby

OBSCURED POV - THROUGH TREES-- 24

From a distance A SICKLE BLADE enters frame pulls a
branch aside Sheryl attends to Mikes wound

The POV narrows solely on SHERYL
TIMBER FALLS TRAIL 1-- 25

Mike looks at Sheryl a twinge of embarrassment in his eyes

MIKE
You know me and blood we dont do
so well

SHERYL
I know

(She finishes)
All done
OFF SCREEN CRUNCH of something stepping on a thicket

Sheryl glances toward the sound Mike admires the dressing
of the wound

MIKE
Not bad Nightingale Not bad at all

SHERYL
Did you hear something

Mike follows her eye-line Theres a softer CRUNCH

MIKE
Its probably the deer

SHERYL
The deer went in the other direction

Mikes demeanor suddenly becomes cold creepy

MIKE
Maybe its someone or something
stalking us

SHERYL
Quit it
MIKE
Something inhuman watching our every
move
SHERYL

I said knock it off

MIKE
Something coming for you Sheryl

Sheryl straps on her backpack

SHERYL
Just when I think theres hope for
you
MIKE
What

SHERYL
Youre an asshole

Sheryl walks away

MIKE
This is a joke Youre not really mad

She turns the corner and is out of sight

MIKE
Im sorry
(Under his breath)

Unbelievable
Mikes in disbelief He grabs his backpack heads after her
MIKE
Sheryl
He turns the corner looks up but doesnt see her The path

Mike moves up the winding path He stops eyes searching

Somethings wrong

The path opens up Mike can now see a hundred yards ahead

but No sign of Sheryl

MIKE
(Calls out)
Sheryl This isnt funny

Silence

Two birds SCREAM and fly from their perch overhead Mike eyes

steep incline He brushes past a bush and stops Lying just
off the path SHERYLS BLUE HIKERS TOWEL He picks it up

26 EXT JUST OFF THE TRAIL TIMBER FALLS 1 - DAY
Mike freezes when he sees Sheryls backpack lies against
a tree A few feet farther along her cut-off jean shorts
Next to them her shirt But no Sheryl until
SHERYL (OS)
Good old Hansel Following the trail
of bread crumbs
Mike turns to see Sheryl lying against a rock wearing just
her bra and panties She smiles at him coyly Mike exhales
deeply Relieved but fuming
MIKE

it
Okay he had that coming
MIKE

her They kiss Then Mike breaks the embrace
MIKE
Dont disappear on me again

Sheryl mouths the words I promise Crosses her heart

He leans in they kiss again Soft and sweet at first Then
it deepens

Sheryl rubs his chest and removes his shirt They kiss
again Harder this time Their hands all over one another

Mike slides his hand under Sheryls panties between her
legs She moans softly Sheryl unhooks her bra and is about
to remove it when

CLYDE

Lord knows the will of a man gets

tested Cruelly most
righteous persevere

times But the
They do what

needs to be done even though they
dont want to Its what makes a man
aman Let me tell you the story of

Judas he was one of

Jesuss apostles

Judas led Roman Soldiers to the

capture and eventual

death of our Lord

Jesus Christ And now is supposedly

seated next to Satan

his soul burning

in hell forever for this sin But I

dont believe thats

the case I have

my own theory The death of Jesus was
predicted thousands of years before
Judas ever came along And for the
prophecy to be fulfilled Jesus had to
die If he didnt the gates of
heaven couldnt be opened for mankind
I dont think for an instant Judas

wanted to be the one

but someone

had to Judas helped Jesus so Jesus
could die for our sins Save us all
And I believe at this moment Judas
is in heaven despite his sin because
it led to the greater good

(Beat)
Relations prior to marriage is a sin
You and Sheryl are sinners in the
Lords eyes And because of those
sins your souls are damned But Ida
and Me were gonna give you a chance
to save your souls and do the right
thing but as previously stated
you will need to persevere and show
the strength and will of your
character But youll do it Because
thats what needs to be done
