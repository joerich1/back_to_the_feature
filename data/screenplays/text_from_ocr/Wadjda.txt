WADJDA

Written by

Haifaa Al Mansour
BLACK SCREEN

Sounds of a busy schoolroom shoes shuffling across the
floor girls shouting laughing and gossiping to each other

GUNSHOTS and the WHINNY of horses blare out The girls fall
quiet before they start singing in unison

GIRLS (VO)
Its time for Jihad its the only
choice The war is boiling
calling

TEACHER (VO)
Girls Stand still in your spots

FADE IN

INT SCHOOL AUDITORIUM (SAUDI ARABIA)- DAY 1

A group of 11 YEAR-OLD GIRLS stand in three rows on a home-
made wooden stage A banner reads The Secondary Fourth
School for Girls-Riyadh East A TEACHER eyes them
skeptically

TEACHER
Again from the beginning

She pushes play on a small tape recorder on the floor

CHORUS OF GIRLS
Its time for Jihad its the only
choice The war is boiling
calling

The front row has four girls one of whom is WAJDA cute face with big smart eyes

They all sing in tune except for her Shes looking away
singing absentmindedly missing most of the words

Wajda watches two older girls FATIN and FATIMA pass by
Wajda waves to them as she sings

She looks at the teacher now scowling at her tucks her
hands in her pocket and tries to follow the other girls They
all look similar except for Wajda

The SONG halts abruptly as the teacher hits Stop on the
tape recorder The girls voices trail off
TEACHER
Wajda Step to the front please

Wajda makes her way out of the rows of girls NOURA a
sweet and perfect type bumps into her smiles and fills her
place in the front line Wajda stands in front of the line of
girls alone

TEACHER (CONT’D)

Why don’t you show us all how well
you sing Start with the first
verse

Wajda becomes very nervous Her face reddens and she stares
hard at the floor she tries to sing but her mouth clamps
tight

TEACHER (CONTD)

Well If you don’t want to share
that “beautiful” voice of yours
with us

The teacher gestures towards the tape recorder

Wajda stares at the floor as she sits down next to the tape
recorder scowling

The line is much more unified now The Teacher smiles with
satisfaction then glares at her

TEACHER (CONT’D)
Well

Like a professional DJ Wajdas hand rewinds the tape stops
it and hits Play all in one motion

THE CHORUS OF GIRLS
Its time for Jihad its the only
choice The war is boiling
calling The horses are prepared
the battle will start War heals
wounds way better than suppressing
anger If our religion is
humiliated heaven calls and our
fate is written Where are the
proud men to answer the calls
Allhu Akbar is our song It is our
light and the fire we fight with

THE CHORUS CONTINUES THROUGH THE TITLES

STATIC BLENDS OVER THE SONG LIKE A RADIO TUNING TO ANOTHER
CHANNEL and then
A RAUCOUS ROCK SONG STARTS

INT WAJDAS ROOM - DAY 2

In her small sparsely decorated room between a single bed
and a window covered completely with wallpaper Wajda hits
record on her tape recorder as the ROCK SONG continues

Dancing and moving to the beat she insures that a cord from
the window is properly connected to the radio antennae

She writes down the song on a track list labeled Wajdas
Awesome Mix Tape Vol 7 Next she counts out homemade
bracelets and puts them in small plastic bags Finally she
puts on her black converse high-tops with colored laces

As she waits for the ROCK SONG to end she looks through the
half open door to her MOTHER busy drying her hair

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY 3

WAJDAS MOTHER struggles with a broken hair-dryer as
she straightens her beautiful long hair She is petite with
a definite sparkle in her eye but right now she’s
frustrated The brush becomes too hot and she quickly dries
the rest of her hair without it

INT WAJDAS ROOM - DAY 4
Wajda takes some money from a drawer and puts it in her
pocket She hits Stop on the tape recorder and runs out
INT LIVING ROOMKITCHEN - DAY 5
Wajdas Mother twists her hair and adds colored clips She
moves to the kitchen and adds cups of cardamom and coffee to
boiling water in an old pot Outside a car HONKS its horn

In rapid motions her Mother takes the over-boiling coffee
puts it in a thermos and grabs her notebooks

Wajda enters drops her backpack and hurries behind carrying
the rest of her Mothers supplies

The Mother grabs keys from a hook by the entrance A string
of blue prayer beads fall to the floor She puts them back on
the hook pulls her veil over her face and turns to Wajda
MOTHER
Dont forget your key and dont
lock the upper lock Your Father
may be coming later after his night
shift

EXT FRONT OF WAJDAS HOUSE - DAY 6

A Pakistani Driver IQBAL (late 20s) squats in front of an
old van sticking the broken headlights on with tape He
turns as Wajda and her Mother emerge

IQBAL
(In broken Arabic bossy)
It very long way Madame Other
teachers we are taking very long
way You late every day No taking
you late

WAJDA
Shes not late You just came I
saw you - five minutes not even

IQBAL
I no talk to you little girl I
talk to your Mother she is late

Iqbal enters the car and slams the door A picture of a cute
smiling child wearing traditional Indian dress with flowers
in her hair falls to the car’s floor Iqbal picks up the
picture and cleans it carefully then puts it back on the
car’s counter

MOTHER
Dont worry about him Okay yalla
bye
(to Iqbal) )

No problem Iqbal You take lots of
money lets have some quiet for
the long drive

She takes her things from Wajda and quickly enters the van
The bus jolts away Wajda is about to walk back into the
house when the minivan swerves to avoid an oncoming car
almost crashing into it She watches until it disappears
worried for her Mother

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY 7

Wajda grabs her backpack stopping by the mirror She looks
at herself and touches her hair then puts on her abbayah
EXT THE NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - DAY 8

Concrete houses line the street All the windows are covered
in aluminum A typical middle class neighborhood in Riyadh
Saudi Arabia

Groups of girls walk to school completely covered in
abbayahs and veils distinguishable only by their different
backpacks Taxis and minivans pass by full of covered women
in black

Wajda exits her gate and walks towards school Suddenly a
rock flies by her feet and knocks a soda can from its place
She looks up to see her FATHER smiling and tossing
another rock up in the air playfully

Dark and handsome with short soft black hair and a well
groomed mustache he wears a worn-out blue oil-man’s uniform

FATHER
Watch this

He flings the rock towards another can just past her on the
wall She ducks but looks over to see the can fly from its
place Wajda searches and picks up another rock

WAJDA
Oh yeah check this out

Full of bravado she flings the rock at a milk carton near
his feet but it falls short and BOUNCES off target

FATHER
Ha Keep practicing Youre getting
there

WAJDA
Look whos back Where have you
been

She smiles runs and gives him a big hug

FATHER
Oof Look at this

He pulls out a shiny black rock from his pocket

FATHER (CONTD)
Its volcanic from the Empty
Quarter It has a great velocity
Itll help your aim Now get going

She takes it beaming He taps her on her head and she runs
off to school
WAJDA
We left the door unlocked
Moms been waiting for you all
week

The father’s eyes flicker at the mention of the mother He
passes his hand over his untidy black hair feeling uneasy

EXT FRONT OF THE CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY 9

ABDULLAH a skinny bright-eyed boy stands near the
entryway setting up a billboard He peeks inside at Wajda as
she enters and heads for the candy bars picking out
chocolate She sees him and smiles Abdullah immediately
looks away

He busies himself with the billboard attaching a large
election poster of an overweight mustached man on a chair
that looks like a throne The poster reads Vote for me for
Municipal Council Your glorious representation

Abdullahs bicycle stands next to the board with his books
clamped onto a rack on the back

Out of the corner of his eye he watches Wajda approach
munching on a breakfast sandwich He quickly brushes his hair
into place and acts busy and important

WAJDA
(laughing)
Huh what is this an advertisement
for mustache products

Abdullah smiles composes himself and faces her with an
annoyed look

ABDULLAH
Smart-ass its a mustache so
strong a falcon could stand on it

WAJDA
A falcon An airplane could land on
that thing

Abdullah smiles but then sees a group of boys approaching He
quickly snatches the sandwich out of her hands and runs off

ABDULLAH
Thanks for buying me breakfast

WAJDA
Hey If its a race youre after
dont blame it on the sandwich

She breaks into a run after him They race through the
streets away from the boys switching positions in the race
She overtakes him snatches the sandwich and looks back
pumping her arms in the air relishing the victory

Away from the other boys Abdullah now smiles at her He then
runs back to the billboard

EXT THE NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - DAY 10

Wajda walks on to school eating her sandwich happily She
continues the target practice with her beloved new rock
aiming at several objects as she goes

Suddenly out of nowhere Abdullah snatches her veil as he
zips past her on his bicycle Wajda falls hard to the ground
her sandwich now covered in dirt Her hair is exposed It’s
covered in curls and colored hair clips like her Mothers
but sloppier Abdullah points

ABDULLAH
(laughing)
What is all this

She puts her hands over her head embarrassed

WAJDA
(indignantly)
Its so in fashion now

Abdullah continues laughing She runs furiously after him He
dangles the veil mockingly behind him as he rides ahead

Pitying her Abdullah finally slows down Wajda reaches out
and rips the veil from his hands but falls hard to the
ground into a puddle of mud

Abdullah stops Wajda angrily gets up and screams at him

WAJDA (CONTD)
Stupid How can I go to school like
this

He’s about to get off his bicycle and help her when several
boys come out of a nearby store Abdullah thinly disguises
his guilty look with a mocking smile

ABDULLAH
Did you really think you could
catch me
WAJDA
(confused)
I did catch you You and your
stupid bicycle

ABDULLAH
Yeah right Now you’re late and
covered in mud If you had a
“stupid” bicycle you could go home
and change But you don’t so you
can’t

Wajda hurt looks up as he slowly pedals away with the other
boys all on bikes as well talking and laughing They ride
in circles challenging each other and showing off

Wajda clutches her soaking veil watching them all ride away
together happy and free

WAJDA
(to herself)
I’1l get one and show you

As she smooths out her veil now too dirty to put back on
she doesn’t see Abdullah glancing back with a pained sorry
look

EXT INSIDE THE FRONT GATE OF THE SCHOOL - DAY 11

Wajda tries to blend in with the other girls and sneak in
MS HUSSA the pretty but stoic principal stands
inside the wall that protects the privacy of the school
entrance

A loud LAUGH comes from the gate as Fatin and Fatima enter
Ms Hussa moves towards them

MS HUSSA
All right girls you are just
behind the gate dont laugh so
loudly Womens voices shouldnt
carry outside the door

Fatin smiles and nudges Fatima They giggle but act polite

FATIMA
Sorry Ms Hussa

FATIN
It won’t happen again

Wajda seizes the opportunity to try to sneak past but--

MS HUSSA
Wajda

Caught Wajda stops turns to face her

MS HUSSA (CONTD)

(with malicious enjoyment)
Where is your head cover Are you
coming to school unveiled And who
put those awful clips in your hair

The girls all stop talking and giggle at her except for
Fatin and Fatima who watch sympathetically

Wajda looks down in frustration at her wet veil

INT SCHOOL INTERIOR COURTYARD - DAY 12

The midday sun burns directly above Wajda as she stands in
the corner of the schoolyard punished

EXT THE NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - DAY 13

Wajdas sneakers stand out from all the other girls in plain
black shoes leaving school Her eyes then catch colorful
majestic feet as a group of boys pedal by on their bicycles

They kick up dust and laugh gliding past Wajda watches them
forlornly as they disappear around the corner

Wajda continues walking throwing the stone her Father gave
her at various targets She misses a few times and then
finally hears a “Ping” as it hits its first mark A SHINY
GREEN BICYCLE

Somehow perched above the other side of a fence

She stares at it intrigued for several seconds as it seems
to float on the other side of the fence She picks up her
black stone and entranced her eyes follow this vision

Suddenly it begins to move across the top of the fence until
it comes to the end where Wajda sees that it’s resting on
the top of a moving truck Her heart locks on it and without
even thinking she runs after the bicycle as it disappears
down the next block

EXT STREET IN FRONT OF THE TOY SHOP - DAY 14

Wajda’s feet race her eyes like steel and she finally
catches up to the truck now parked in front of a toy shop

Men unload boxes and bicycles wrapped in plastic bags She
cranes her neck Where is the green one

As Wajda moves forward she hears a SPLASH She looks down
She’s standing in a stream of water She moves to the side

As the truck pulls away the TOY SHOP OWNER goes into the shop
and brings out THE BICYCLE He puts it on display in the
front out in the sun He takes a sign from his clipboard
writes Only 500 Riyals and places it on the handlebars

He goes back inside the store and puts an Talal Maddah
record on an old record player glancing at this strange
little girl still standing outside his door

Her eye then shift to the sign and the price as the MUSIC
drifts out of the store

EXT THE CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY 15

Wajda counts the small wad of money she made at school today
and stuffs it back into her pocket in frustration She takes
out the black stone from her pocket and throws it across the
field at a coke bottle A group of WORKERS yell suggestive
insults at her

INDIAN WORKER
Nice throw Come up and play
with us Let me touch those little
apples

Wajda freezes and pretends she didnt hear him

They laugh vulgarly at her As she hurries towards the rock
Abdullah appears and picks it up He throws it far across the
lot knocking another coke bottle out of its place

Wajda relaxes relieved to see him but then acts upset as
she runs and picks up the stone She picks up another one and
throws it back towards him

WAJDA
Take this And stop following
me I dont want to play with you
any more They made me stand up all
day at school in the sun for not
having a veil today

The rock falls short of Abdullahs feet He looks at Wajda
ashamed Wajda puts her stone in her pocket glaring at him
He picks up the rock and runs to his bicycle and pulls out a
package

ABDULLAH
Here I got you this

Wajda looks at him walks over and takes the package She
opens it and unfurls a new black veil with a yellow flower
made of beads on the corner She acts defiant as she puts it
in her bag

WAJDA
This doesnt make us even you
know Well get even when we race
I’1l have my new bicycle very soon

ABDULLAH
What Girls cant have bicycles

WAJDA
Then I guess it will be that much
more embarrassing for you when I
beat you

Wajda walks away in a huff Abdullah looks at the stone she
threw at him and stuffs it in his pocket

Abdullah rides away on his bicycle as a small pick-up truck
passes by causing a huge cloud of dust over Abdullah Wajda
looks back and laughs

The CONTRACTOR gets out of his car and heads towards the
workers

He looks at Abdullah

CONTRACTOR
Hey you go away little boy

Abdullah is upset The Contractor goes over to the workers

CONTRACTOR (CONT’D)
All day and only one pillar 5 men
working and I get only one pillar

He slaps one of them on his neck

CONTRACTOR (CONTD)
Go to car go We have to finish
working on the other building

He stuffs the workers onto the back of the truck Some of the
workers put wet towels on their heads to avoid the unbearable
heat

EXT THE NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - DAY 16

Wajda’s sneakers kick up small clouds of dust as she heads
home Green bushes have just been planted on the side of the
road She leans over and smells them She smiles and picks
the leaves off one by one

INT WAJDAS ROOM - DAY 17

Wajda sits at her desk with her money out in front of her
The green leaves are now sorted into small plastic bags to
the side She writes 500 Riyals on a piece of paper and
draws a chart underneath She sorts the notes and counts
them

WAJDA
10 riyals 15 riyals 17 18 19
20 21 22 23 24 25 riyals

She writes 25 Riyals on the chart Then Wajda sits on the
floor with her foot extended and wraps strings around her big
toe making woven bracelets She checks a list of girls names
and football teams

She hears the DOOR opening and goes to meet her Mother

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY 18

Wajdas Mothers face is puffy and red She falls down on the
couch exhausted removes her veil and fans herself with it
Her hair loks messy but full of ribbons and curls

Wajda turns on the air conditioner grinning Her Mother
looks at her as she struggles to lift herself from the couch

MOTHER (0S)
I dont like this look What are
you up to

WAJDA
(excited)
Im going to buy a bicycle to
race Abdullah Al Hanofi

MOTHER
Three hours in the car without AC
I swear this commute is going to
kill me and you tell me bicycle

She takes off her shoes and black socks rubbing her feet

MOTHER (CONTD)
Absolutely forget about getting
a bicycle Have you ever seen any
girl riding a bicycle (pause)
Id rather sell fruit down at the
hospital than go on this hideous
trip every day

Wajda makes a face and stomps off to her room Her Mother
goes to her bedroom and picks up a mans dirty blue uniform
from the floor

EXT THE NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - DAY 19

Wajda hurries off through the gate of a house

INT LIVING ROOM OF WAJDAS GRANDMOTHERS HOUSE - DAY 20

She enters and finds her GRANDMOTHER an overweight woman in
her 60’s watching TV the remote in her hand

GRANDMOTHER
(surprised)
Wajda What are you doing here so
early

Wajda smiles She goes up and kisses her forehead

WAJDA
Good morning Grandmother Hope you

Wajda gives her a plastic bag filled with green leaves She
then opens her abbayah exposing a navy-blue vest on top of
her gray uniform She smiles wider

WAJDA (CONTD)
See Grandmother Im wearing the
vest you made me

GRANDMOTHER
(smiling but suspicious)
Its nice of you to think of me
this early in the morning

She looks happily at the vest and smells the leaves She
pulls her braided hair from her veil and replaces the
withering leaves with the fresh ones Wajda brought

WAJDA
(reluctantly)
Only 10 riyals I brought some for
your friend Um Khalid too

The Grandmother twisting her lips in annoyance slips her
feet into her shoes sighs lifts herself slowly out of her
chair and walks toward the next room

GRANDMOTHER
Did your Mother send you

She struggles to get herself down a small step Wajda looks
at her sympathetically and helps her Her Grandmother gently
pats Wadjas back

WAJDA
No Grandma Im trying to save
some money to buy a nice abbayah

GRANDMOTHER

I dont know what to do with you or
your Father He’s always nagging
me Should I take a second wife I
need a son I tell him Go home
to your wife and daughter and leave
me alone but he keeps coming here
with a list of families I have to
call for brides

The Grandmother gets her wallet and gives Wajda 10 riyals
GRANDMOTHER (CONTD)
He cant even buy an abbayah for
his daughter Where would he get a
dowry for a second wife

WAJDA
Thanks Grandma

Wajda runs out avoiding looking at her Grandmother

EXT INSIDE THE FRONT GATE OF THE SCHOOL - DAY 21

Wajda walks past Ms Hussa tea-cup in hand bored watching
the crowd of girls flow through the gate

Noura approaches Ms Hussa coyly She gathers up her courage
and holds out a single flower with a note attached

NOURA
(sweetly)
This is for you

Wajda watches from the corner of her eye Ms Hussa looks
questionably at Noura takes the flower and reads the note

MS HUSSA
Thank you for your feelings but
you know you are not supposed to
bring flowers to school

Noura reddens Ms Hussa gives her back the flower then heads

Wajda walks past him to a side table and casually turns a
framed certificate of excellence in math towards him He
quickly glances at it She collapses casually onto the couch

loses and the MUSIC announces the end of the match He leans
back

FATHER

Wajda watches him as he runs his prayer beads idly between
his fingers Her Mother enters and sets dishes on a little
mat on the floor just beside the Father who lights up at her
presence She is all dressed up looking her best

The Father looks up and their eyes meet with pained looks He
reaches out and puts his hand on hers She pauses for a
second and looks at him tenderly She playfully pulls her
hand away and tosses her hair over her shoulder

He bursts into a charming laugh and pulls her towards him
Wajda watches them together happily

the little girl placed on the dashboard

She motions for Abdullah to knock at the door but he shakes
his head and stands behind his bicycle

ABDULLAH
He knew him right That mustache
is a registered trademark

Abdullah directs her attention to a house busy with MEN
coming in and out He directs her away from the scene

ABDULLAH (CONTD)
Their son put stuff around his

He acts out pulling a cord and makes an explosive noise

giant snake from Hell that was sent
to torture the girl that did not
pray after she died

Wadja is busy drawing a picture of a bicycle when she hears
Ms Hussa’s high heels approach Behind Wajda Yasmine
whispers to Noura giggling

YASMINE
There was a thief at Ms Hussas
house

NOURA

It was her lover not a thief Her
Father thought it was a thief and
called the police

A conservative older girl SALMA shushes them

SALMA
If she said it was a thief then it
was a thief

NOURA
(rolling her eyes)
Of course you would think that
Salma The only man that would ever
speak to you would have to be a
thief

Salma looks down eyes watering The girls giggle then
compose themselves as Ms Hussa enters

KORAN TEACHER
Girls Ms Hussa is here to explain
the Koranic competition rules Its
only five weeks away Ill pass
around a sign up sheet

The teacher hands out the sheet as Wajda tuns the page to
hide the bicycle drawing Ms Hussa glances at Wajda then at
the class

MS HUSSA
First weve increased the amount
for the prize It is now 1000
instead of 800 riyals Youll have
to learn all the long suras (the
first 4 chapters of the Koran)

Wajda raises her eyebrows She flips through the Koran on
her desk and measures the amount of paper she would have to
learn

MS HUSSA (CONT’D)
The competition is two parts
youll to study the associated
vocabulary along with the reasons
why the verses were descended from
heaven You also have to learn the
verses and the proper recitation
The correct tone rhythm and pacing
are very important

Wajda sneaks a look at her bicycle drawing and watches the
sign up sheet as it passes from one girl to another
nervously Salma is the first to sign up followed by Noura
and then Yasmine

The sheet finally comes to her and Wajda scribbles her name
Noura raises an eyebrow and looks to Yasmine as Wajda smugly
brings it up hands it to intrigued Ms Hussa and smiles

Nonchalantly she walks around in the aisles pretending to
look at other toys Her eyes stay focused on the bicycle

organizes his records and she quickly turns away

She heads to the computer game section and looks at one that
says Learn the Koran the easy way She studies it
thinking
TOY SHOP OWNER

and tries to pedal away but is weighed down by the lights

bumps into Abdullah as he tries to move out of the way

on the two girls

push the magazine under each others clothes

MS HUSSA

the bicycle She idly switches a broken bare light-bulb on
and off on the side wall

ABDULLAH

WAJDA
It doesnt work anyway

She looks down at the campaign tent

hard for me

Noura and the girls all giggle

WAJDA (CONTD)

But I heard on the Koran channel

yesterday that if it is easy for

you you get only one reward But
if it is hard for you to read and
remember you get two rewards One
for reading the Koran and one for
the trouble you go through

KORAN TEACHER
Thank you Wajda for sharing this

at Wajda

she will back them up Wajda looks at Ms Hussa then looks
down uncomfortably

WAJDA

The girls gawk at her in disbelief Wajda avoids their gaze
Ms Hussa looks at the girls smugly They stare at Wajda
WAJDA (CONT’D)

because of my vest

She pauses as Ms Hussa looks at her with slight impatience

WAJDA (CONTD)
Its a very distinct vest

MS HUSSA

compose herself and then both burst into laughter

(straightening up)
Shame on you bringing a boy
upstairs with no one home What

Her Mother sits on her knees and faces Wajda threateningly

MOTHER

As they walk off the roof Wajda kicks a piece of ribbon that
had fallen off the bicycle The ribbon flies in the air as
their figures disappear into the stairwell

WAJDA (0S)
Are you going to tell his Uncle

MOTHER (0S)
He is a nice boy His only problem
is that you wont leave him alone
(they both laugh) )

the group of men in the other room talking and laughing
loudly Trying to relieve the tension she starts to SING

MOTHER
Be quiet Do you want them to hear

Wajda stops singing and looks at her Mother pushing back a
lock of hair off her forehead looking exhausted

Her Father KNOCKS once and they pass the plates through to
him at the door He smiles as he takes it

FATHER

tree She runs her finger along the branches

MOTHER
(cynically)
Your Fathers glorious family tree

Her Mother eats discarded food from the plates then finds
her husbands prayer beads and picks them up tenderly

Wajda leaves the family tree and hooks her game into the TV
as her Mother leaves the room

MOTHER (CONTD)
Make sure you clean that all up I
dont want to do anything that will
get him upset with us again

Distracted Wajda puts down the controller and looks at the
family tree The names read “Khalid Mansour Mohammed
Omar” Her Fathers name stands alone while all of his
brothers have leaves with boys names below them Wajda cuts
a piece of blank paper from the Koran writes her name on it
and adds it under her Fathers name

MOTHER (0S) (CONT’D)
I almost forgot Ms Hussa called
earlier

Wajda looks at her wide-eyed while hooking up the game
controller The Mother enters smiling suspiciously

MOTHER (CONTD)
Shes really pleased with you
Honestly the way Ms Hussa was

As they talk Wajda looks out to the hallway where Fatin and
Fatima pass by with their furious MOTHERS Fatin tries to
explain something but her Mother silences her with an angry
look Fatima notices Wajda watching sympathetically Fatima
looks away

KORAN TEACHER (CONT’D)
Okay put them away now Wajdas

Wajda looks down trying to hide being ashamed

KORAN TEACHER (CONT’D)
Lets get started Yasmine read
from page 13

YASMINE

KORAN TEACHER
Wajda read

Wajda closes her Koran and looks at the teacher hesitantly

WAJDA
Ill try without looking

The Koran Teacher looks at her surprised

WAJDA (CONTD)

(reciting nervously)
And whoever opposes the Messenger
after guidance has become clear to
him and follows other than the way
of the believers - We will give him
what he has taken and drive him
into Hell and evil it is as a
destination Indeed Allah does not
forgive association with Him but
He forgives what is less than that
for whom He wills They call upon
instead of Him none but female
deities and they call upon none
but a rebellious Satan

KORAN TEACHER

Very nice Wajda you remembered it
all But you have to recite You
cant just gobadababdababdaba

(turns to Salma)
How about our young bride Lets
hear that voice And listen Wajda
you have to recite like this if you
want to win

SALMA
And whoever opposes the Messenger
after guidance has become clear to
him and follows other than the way
of the believers - We will give him
what he has taken and drive him
into Hell and evil it is as a
destination

The sweet sound echoes through the room while the girls
follow along Noura’s eyes stare at Salma through angry
slits Wajda looks out at the empty hallway disappointed

102 INT SCHOOL CORRIDOR - DAY 102

The girls line up for an assembly Ms Hussa makes her way to
the stage and picks up the megaphone She stares over the
crowd sternly She checks the microphone

MS HUSSA
HelloHelloIn the name of God
First I want to thank all the girls
for their hard work this term We
are the best school in the area

(MORE)

MS HUSSA (CONTD)
And I would like to remind all the
girls that school is a place for
virtue and knowledge (clears her
throat) Girls I would like you to
listen very well We caught two
girls committing a sin behind the
school Their names are Fatin Ali
and Fatima Umar

The girls stare intently as Ms Hussa motions the “offenders”
forward

MS HUSSA (CONT’D)
And now they will come to the front
of the stage to repent

Fatin and Fatima make their way to the stage They appear
broken their heads hanging low and their faces blank Wajda
upon seeing the girls feels sick to her stomach

MS HUSSA (CONT’D)
To avoid similar situations you
are no longer allowed to bring
flowers to school for your friends
or give each other letters or
autographs And no one is allowed
to hold hands Do you understand
Good You may go to your classes
now

The girls move quickly toward the door As Fatin and Fatima
leave Fatin bumps into a GIRL

GIRL
(panicked screaming)
Dont touch me

Fatin says nothing Wajda starts to walk toward them both
when she sees Ms Hussa waiting by the stairs

Wajda stops glances at the two girls then back at Ms Hussa
who smiles at her Wajda turns her head quickly and walks
away from Fatin and Fatima feeling guilty and uncertain

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 103

Wajda brings in her Koran and sits on the floor next to her
Mother who irons her Fathers thobes singing

MOTHER
The handsome man stole my heart
with his black eyes I come closer

MOTHER (CONTD)
making me feel hollow No tears no
words can bring him back Oh my

Wajda ignores the piles of note-cards scattered around her
looking morose Her Mother looks at her concerned and stops
singing

WAJDA
I dont want to finish the
competition I hate Ms Hussa Im
tired

MOTHER

What does Ms Hussa have to do with
it Its your business

(smiling encouragingly)
Your Father is happy that you are
doing this He is so proud of you
Please Wajda That’s very
important right now

Wajda looks at her Mother a glimmer of hope in her eyes She
sits up straight and recites Surah 30 (Ar-Rum) verse 21

WAJDA

And of His Signs is that he creates
for you mates out of yourselves so
that you may find tranquility in
them and He has put love and mercy
between you Surely in this there
are indeed Signs for a people who
reflect

Wajda stops reciting Her Mother looks at her lovingly

MOTHER
Give it a tone like this
(beautifully)
And of His Signs is that he creates
for you mates out of yourselves so
that you may find tranquility in
them - Go on try it

WAJDA
(imitating her Mother)
And of His Signs is that he creates
for you mates out of yourselves so
that you may find tranquility in
them

MOTHER
Very good Now do the next lines

MOTHER (CONTD)

between you Surely in this there

MOTHER
(proudly teasing her)
Excellent Your voice is as lovely
as your Mothers

Wajda stops realizing she’s doing it well

WAJDA
I feel shy I cant recite like
this in front of everyone

MOTHER
You are shy Ha I only wish it
were true

Wajda makes a face at her Mother who bursts out laughing
Wajda barely smiles

Outside they see the lights Abdullah strung up turn on and
illuminate the street and their living room

Wajda and her Mother look at each other

MOTHER (CONTD)
Youve worked hard Come on

She quickly turns the iron off and they run up to the roof

104 EXT THE ROOF OF WAJDAS HOUSE - NIGHT 104

The two look out as groups of men gather in the street below
The lights reflect on Wajda and her Mother who look so much
alike in the dim light A breeze blows their hair gently
Down the street they see Abdullahs bearded Uncle greeting
everyone as they arrive

Abdullah stands at the end of the row dressed up in his
thobe and gutra Wajda points down at her Father excited

WAJDA
See My Father is there
MOTHER
(intrigued searching)
Where
WAJDA
(points down firmly)
There
MOTHER
(excited)
Oh I see him Look how handsome he
is

Wajda looks at her Mother from the corner of her eye She is
busy looking at her Father Wajda throws a little stone where
Abdullah stands and he looks up He sees her without a veil
or head covering in the golden lights he himself strung up
and smiles

He fixes his gutra by throwing its ends on his shoulders to
show how well dressed and important he is

Wajda smiles back and gestures that there’s something on his
cheek Abdullah looks worried and tries to clean his face
Wajda laughs Her Mother looks at her disapprovingly

Another man standing next to Abdullah looks up Both Wajda
and her Mother duck behind the wall quickly laughing softly

Wajdas Mother lies down on the roof and stares at the stars
in the clear sky Wajda lies next to her and smiles

WAJDA
So do you love him

MOTHER
(a little shy surprised)
Who Your Father

WAJDA
(smiling teasingly)
No the neighbors boy

MOTHER
(also teasingly)
I dont think I am the one in love
with the neighbors boy

Wajda gets embarrassed laughing dismissively at her Mother

Her Mother laughs Wajda flips to her side and rests her head

on her arm in order to face her Mother

WAJDA
You didnt answer

MOTHER
I was in high school when he asked
for my hand All the girls were so
jealous when they saw his picture
He was the first man in my life
and most probably the last And I
have to admit hes a lot of fun

WAJDA
You are way prettier than any other
woman I have ever seen Youll give
my Father a heart attack with your
red dress

MOTHER

(suddenly sad)
Yeah He wont see it Hell be
busy in the mens section
The man I know he talks big but
he would never burn my heart with a
second wife I dont know who fills
his head with this nonsense

She sits up quickly changing the subject

MOTHER (CONTD)
Enough Lets practice one more
time for your competition tomorrow
And dont tell anyone about that
crazy bicycle story of yours
theyll never let you win

Wajda makes a face sits up determined and recites

WAJDA
And of His Signs is that he creates
for you mates out of yourselves so
that you may find tranquility in
them and He has put love and mercy
between you

MOTHER
(warmer inflection)
«Mercy between you

WAJDA
«Mercy between you

MOTHER
Let it come from your heart and
forget everyone around you

She takes Wajdas hand and places it over her heart

WAJDA
(more sincere)
And of His Signs is that he creates
for you mates out of yourselves so
that you may find tranquility in
them and He has put love and mercy
between you

Her voice echoes across the empty roof while the election
lights sway in the breeze

105 INT WAJDAS PARENTS’ ROOM - NIGHT 105

Wajda lies in her Fathers place in the bed Her Mother
sleeps next to her in a semi-fetal position Wajda stretches
her arms in the vast empty space of the bed occupying only a
small part of it

106 INT WAJDAS PARENTS’ ROOM - DAY 106

Wajda now sleeps in a semi-fetal position Her Mother wakes
her up already dressed in her abbayah to leave for work She
caresses Wajdas hair

MOTHER
Now youve got a big day today
When you go up on the stage say

WAJDA
Where are you going so early God
inspire me make things easier for

MOTHER
(while fixing her veil)
I have to open up the school today
Im the teacher on duty Untie my

Wajda yawns and runs her hand through her hair

WAJDA
Untie my tongue

MOTHER
---So I speak fluently

They hear a car HONKING at the door Wajda touches the beads
on her Mothers abbayah

WAJDA
---So I speak fluently

Her Mother kisses her forehead and gets ready to leave

MOTHER
I wish I could come today You know
this damn long commute I know

your Grandmother wants you to wear
the vest she made you for luck

WAJDA
I hate that vest I only ever wore
it that day I went to visit her

MOTHER
I know you hate it but do it for
her

Wajda stares out into the hallway as her Mother pops her head
back into the doorway

MOTHER (CONTD)
And whatever happens for
Gods sake act wise No
bargaining no fighting and no
crazy ideas about bicycles Watch
that tongue of yours Understand

She smiles and leaves Her black shadow stretches across the
wall and then disappears Wajda sighs and falls back onto the
bed She reaches over and touches her Fathers prayer beads
on the night-stand

EXT THE NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - DAY 107

Wajda walks whispering to herself the tajweed rule from a
note-card She throws her Father’s rock at a bottle

WAJDA
Man yajaala Mayyjaal edgham

PING The bottle spins She smiles and walks on to school

INT THE TOY SHOP - DAY 108

tape labeled “Wajda’s Awesome Mix Tape Volume 8” He puts it
in the player and presses “play” A ROCK SONG starts He
shakes his head disapprovingly smiling

INT SCHOOL CORRIDOR - DAY 109

Wajda and several other girls practice their recitations
Wajda goes through her note cards pulling pieces of paper
out of her pockets and scanning them Ms Hussa enters

of paper She takes out her Fathers prayer beads and the
black rock She notices Salma sitting on a bench with her
hands tucked between her shaking knees looking around
nervously Ms Hussa moves to leave

MS HUSSA
If we find any type of study

Wajda slowly walks over to Salma bends down next to her

WAJDA

Wajda looks at her perplexed Overhearing Noura approaches

SALMA (CONTD)

You know after you sleep with

Noura nods in agreement hiding her excitement

NOURA
If you feel nervous about it maybe
you shouldnt do it
(pause)
Its a lot of stress

Salma gives Noura a hateful look Ms Hussa passes by her
hands full of paper Salma gets up and runs over to her The
two speak quietly Wajda watches them slowly moving the rock
between her thumb and fingers as Ms Hussa sends Salma out
the door

111 INT SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - DAY (LATER) 111

Ms Hussa stands under the words Championship on the
blackboard Noura Salma and Wajda sit at a table in front of
the stage

Wajda looks petrified while Noura smiles with contentment
and Salma stares ahead in quiet determination

NOURA
(whispering to Wajda)
Ill bet you never thought youd
make it this far But beware of
the ugly bride over there she
looks pretty determined to win
Especially after her shower

Wajda turns away Salma flashes Noura a look of intense anger
about to cry

MS HUSSA
Girls well now have you recite
Please read until we indicate for
you to stop We’ll start with Surat
al Nisa from ayat 66 Noura begin
with “If we had decreed”

NOURA
(flatly but correct)
And if We had decreed upon them
Kill yourselves or Leave your
homes they would not have done
it except for a few of them
(MORE )
Ms

NOURA (CONTD)
But if they had done what they were
instructed it would have been
better for them and a firmer
position And then We would have
given them from Us a great reward
And We would have guided them to a
straight path And whoever obeys
Allah and the Messenger - those
will be with the ones upon whom
Allah has bestowed favor of the
prophets the steadfast affirmers
of truth the martyrs and the
righteous And excellent are those
as companions

Hussa raises her hand for her to stop Noura sits back

confidently Ms Hussa looks to Salma to begin

MS HUSSA
Salma start Surat al Bakara from
the beginning

SALMA
(lowering her eyes)
In the name of Allah the
Beneficent the Merciful Alif Lam
Mim This Book there is no doubt
in it is a guide to those who
guard against evil

Noura’s cold eyes distract her

SALMA (CONT’D)
Those who believe in the unseen and
keep up prayer and spend out of
what We have given them And who
and who

KORAN TEACHER
(giving her cues)
And who believe

(shaken continuing)
Who believe in that which has been
revealed to you and that which was
revealed before you and uh

KORAN TEACHER
And they are sure of the
hereafter

SALMA
(more shaken continuing)
And they are sure of the
hereafter These are on a

Salma stops and looks up Ms Hussa raises her hand

MS HUSSA
Thats enough Thank you Salma
Lets continue

Wajda removes her sweaty hand from the table leaving a moist
imprint on it She dries her hand on her dress

She puts her hand in her pocket pulls out her Father’s stone
and grips it tightly A piece of paper sticks out of the
pocket on her vest She looks at Salma trying not to cry

MS HUSSA (CONTD)
Let’s continue

Wajda puts the stone back in her pocket and waits silently
for the teachers instructions

KORAN TEACHER
Wajda please start with Surat al
Bakara ayat 7 Starting with
“There is disease”

Wajda looks uncertain feeling small in the large room She
steadies herself in a moment that drags on endlessly In the
crowd she sees Fatin and Fatima looking directly at her She
is about to lower her eyes but something in their now beaten
faces makes her find her confidence

She meets their eyes right on and starts reciting in a
beautiful voice which begins weak and then gradually grows
stronger and more intense

WAJDA

In the name of Allah the
Beneficent the Merciful There is

(pause)
There is a disease in their
hearts so Allah added to their
disease and they shall have a
painful chastisement because they
lied And when it is said to them
Do not make mischief in the land
they say We are but peace-makers
Now surely they themselves are the
mischief makers but they do not
perceive

Wajda stops and looks around the room for some indication on
whether or not she should continue

MS HUSSA
(softly)
Thank you Wajda that was very

good

Noura looks worried and very angry Fatima has a small smile
on her face The two teachers lean in to consult each other
The moment seems endless to Wajda

MS HUSSA (CONTD)
Girls you did an excellent job and
you should be proud you all made it
this far Congratulationswe will
announce the winner after the
prayer

Out of the corner of her eye she sees Noura peering down at
Wajdas vest pocket Wajda looks at her confused then down
at her pocket and sees the paper sticking out

Noura’s mouth widens in a devilish grin as she sits straight
up in her chair

Wajda blanches pushes the paper down in to her pocket
hiding it then looks up quickly panicking

As the girls exit the stage Noura approaches the table where
the judges sit She leans over to Ms Hussa and whispers
something into her ear Ms Hussa furrows her brow pauses
for a moment and looks at Wajda

MS HUSSA (CONT’D)
Wajda please come over here

Worried Wajda walks over to the judges table

MS HUSSA (CONT’D)
Empty your pockets

Wajda stares at her

WAJDA
I wasnt cheating I swear

NOURA
I saw a cheat-sheet in her pocket
Ms Hussa You said that they were
to have no notes or else they’d be
disqualified

MS HUSSA
Thank you Noura for your courage
You may go now

Noura shoots Wajda an evil smile

MS HUSSA (CONTD)
Wajda empty your pockets please

Wajda slowly pulls out the contents of her pockets first the
rock then her Fathers prayer beads and puts them on the
table She pauses looks down at her vest pocket and
reluctantly pulls out the folded piece of paper Not
remembering what it is she looks at it with despair and lays
it on the table

The Koran teacher takes the paper from the table and reads
it Her face relaxes and she suppresses a smile She hands it
to Ms Hussa

KORAN TEACHER
Ms Hussa someone loves you and
thinks you are like the moon I
dont know if we agree with that

She laughs teasingly to Ms Hussa then looks to Wajda kindly

KORAN TEACHER (CONT’D)
You know very well you shouldnt
bring notes like this to school
not after the whole saga with Fatin
and Fatima

Ms Hussa takes the paper and looks at it shocked She looks
over to Wajda for answers Wajda looks at her wide-eyed
petrified to be caught with it

MS HUSSA
Thank you Wajda Please go join
the other girls for prayer

She smiles and hands the note back to her

MS HUSSA (CONTD)
And when you return this note to
its illustrious author I assume
you will do so with the benevolence
and graciousness your Koran
learning has taught you

Wajda takes the note turns away still wide eyed and inches
slowly away from the table As she moves away from them her
look of fear and shock turns into a very broad grin

INT CORRIDOR - DAY 112

When she gets out into the hallway alone Wajdas smile
breaks into a giggle until she bursts out into
uncontrollable fits of laughter

INT MOSQUE - DAY 113

The girls line up into rows Some are taking out their
abbayahs and wrapping themselves for prayer

Ms Hussa is in the first row along with the other
contestants and a very angry Noura at her side

Wajda sees Fatin and Fatima in the middle of the mosque and
lines up next them smiling She unfolds her abbayah and gets
ready to pray Fatin looks over at her raising her eyebrows

FATIN
You sure you want to stand next to
us

Fatima holds Fatins arm then looks gratefully at Wajda

FATIMA
Congratulations

WAJDA
They havent announced the winner
yet

FATIN
You won and youre their favorite
convert so Im sure they were all
rooting for you anyway

Wajda stares uncomfortably at the floor unsure what to say
WAJDA
I I want to buy a bicycle Im

sorry I had to win

Fatin pushes Wajda away with her elbow Fatima shakes her
head at Fatin and turns to Wajda

FATIMA
A bicycle You would never dare
We all know that you’re a coward

Wajda looks up to see Ms Hussa searching for her

MS HUSSA
Wajda We saved you a spot in the
first row with the other
contestants

Wajda looks back to Fatin and Fatima fixing their abbayahs
for prayer Wajda hesitates

FATIMA
Go

Fatin looks the other way but Fatima nods Sadly Wajda lines
up next to Ms Hussa who grabs Wajdas abbayah and pulls her
next to her She whispers down to her

MS HUSSA
Good Muslims have to line up close
to each other so the devil
(indicates Fatin and
Fatima) )
doesnt get in between them

Wajda avoids looking at Ms Hussa as she lines up in her
spot The call for the start of prayer is announced and all
of the girls pray in one synchronized voice

GIRLS
Allhu Akbar

114 INT SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - DAY 114

Noura Salma and Wajda wait nervously on stage Ms Hussa
reaches to a megaphone behind the blackboard

Salma smiles to Wajda

MS HUSSA (CONTD)
And now the runner up to this

Noura Al Markoon

Wajda covers her face tearing up with happiness the exact
opposite of Noura’s right now

Salma rushes up and gives Wajda an ecstatic congratulatory
hug She scurries back to her seat and savors every second of
Noura rigid and miserable trudging up to Ms Hussa taking
her certificate and storming off the stage and out of the
room

MS HUSSA (CONTD)
Wajda Al Safan you are our
champion Congratulations You are
in this spot because of your
devotion and perseverance and I
hope all the girls here today learn
from your example

Wajdas face beams with happiness as she walks slowly to the
front of the stage She nods thank you as Ms Hussa hands
her the certificate She looks nervously at the megaphone

MS HUSSA (CONTD)
Alf Mabruk bint al Saffon Dont be
shy And what are your plans for
the prize money

As Ms Hussa hands her the megaphone Wajda pauses and scans
the faces of the audience

WAJDA
Mmmmm

Ms Hussa looks at Wajda and smiles encouragingly Wajdas
gaze falls on Salma and the rest of the girls and then she
sees Fatin and Fatima looking up at her - Fatin with
contempt and Fatima with a glimmer of pride Wajda takes a
big sigh and gathers her courage

WAJDA (CONTD)
(defiantly to Ms Hussa)
I am going to buy a bicycle from
the shop down the road

Giggles and laughter erupt from the audience

MS HUSSA
What

Wajda looks at Fatin and Fatima who both smile impressed
with her statement Wajda looks back at Ms Hussa

WAJDA
(matter-of-factly)
Im buying a bicycle
(pauses and smiles) )
With no training wheels of course

Fatin and Fatima laugh along with the rest of the crowd

MS HUSSA
(persuasively)
Now Wajda wouldnt you rather
donate the money to our fighting
brothers in Palestine

WAJDA
I dont think so Im going to buy
a bicycle

Wajda looks at Ms Hussa calmly and shrugs her shoulders Ms
Hussa stands unsympathetically

MS HUSSA
A bicycle is not a toy for girls
Wajda Especially Muslim girls who
need to protect their honor Plus
Im sure your family wont allow
it We will donate the money in
your name to our brothers and
sisters fighting in Palestine

WAJDA
But-—-

MS HUSSA
Thank you for your obedience and
generosity You may step down now

Wajda stares at Ms Hussa then looks over at the other
teachers cautiously realizing their disapproval She
continues staring at Ms Hussa knowing she cannot argue
Distraught she turns to leave but Ms Hussa stops her

MS HUSSA (CONTD)
(whispers)
You think you can act however you
want and people wont notice This
will haunt you forever

Wajda infuriated speaks very loudly

WAJDA
You mean like your “handsome”
thief

The crowd goes silent as does a shocked and humiliated Ms
Hussa Wajda marches down to join the crowd of girls leaving
the big hall - Fatin and Fatima right by her side Fatima
messes up her hair and Wajda tries to smile holding back
tears

EXT FRONT OF THE SCHOOL - DAY 115

Abdullah waits outside as Wajda exits sobbing She storms
past him without pausing He runs along after her confused

ABDULLAH

WAJDA

She continues walking He stands in disbelief for a few
seconds and then runs along after her She is heartbroken
with tears in her eyes She turns her head to hide them

Abdullah retreats taken aback by her vulnerability

Wajda runs off leaving him standing alone in the street

EXT STREET IN FRONT OF THE TOY SHOP 116

Wajda speeds up as she nears the toy shop She breaks into a
run as she sees that the bicycle is no longer there She
looks up to the Toy Shop Owner unloading boxes from a truck
He glances over at her and shrugs his shoulders

TOY SHOP OWNER

Wajda storms off angrily crying fresh tears

Abdullah standing at the corner stares at the empty spot in
front where the bicycle once sat

EXT THE CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY 117

Wajda trudges slowly defeated trying not to cry The
workers taunt Wajda as she approaches making rude gestures

WORKER
Come up and play with us little
girl We will have lots of fun

Wajda stops breathing heavily Determined she scoops up
handfuls of stones and throws them violently at the workers
who run for cover She cries

WAJDA
Take this Take this

Abdullah catches up sees what’s going on scoops up a
handful of rocks and joins in aiming for the workers The
FOREMAN approaches them menacingly shaking his fist

FOREMAN
Hey you kids Stop that

ABDULLAH
(holding up a big stone)
Tell your workers to stop bothering

His arm still outstretched he looks at Wajda who drops her

continues towards her home

Her Father sits on the edge of the couch nervously twiddling
his thumbs He runs his hands through his freshly combed hair
when he sees Wajda

to the Majlis and picks up his ghutra and Okal

As he leaves he messes up her hair playfully

She lays down and continues staring at the ticking clock

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 120

Wajda sleeps on the couch still in her school uniform She’s
awakened by the sound of GUNSHOTS and BLASTS of fireworks in
the distance She sits up and sees that the living room is
dark Lights are shining from the bathroom and her Mothers
room She gets up and cautiously walks over

She looks in through the doorway and sees her Mothers
abbayah on the bed right next to

A NEW WHITE LAB COAT

She heads for the bathroom

INT BATHROOM - NIGHT 121

Wajda leans over the sink to wash her face She sees clumps
of freshly cut hair along the inside of the sink As she
examines it closer she hears more GUNSHOTS and BLASTS of
fireworks She looks at the stairway leading to the roof

EXT THE ROOF OF WAJDAS HOUSE - NIGHT 122

Wajda sees her Mother smoking a cigarette in the dim light
Her hair is cut to shoulder length twirling in the wind She
stares off into the distance at a party where strands of
lights line a house a few blocks away

Wajda walks over and stands next to her Mother tossing her
Father’s rock idly in her hand Her Mother tries to
discretely put out her cigarette Wajda stares out at the
house with the lights on it confused The Mother smiles
sadly

MOTHER
I heard the news Congratulations
Im so proud of you

WAJDA
(pouting)
They didnt give me the money

She puts the rock back in her pocket The Mother messes up
Wajdas hair playfully

MOTHER

I cant believe you said you wanted
a bicycle

(laughing) )
They must have thought you were
crazy

(pauses )
Damn them you dont need their

money anyway

Wajda is taken aback by her Mothers tone She watches her
skeptically as she squints off towards the house having the

party

WAJDA
Isnt that my Grandmothers house
I thought my Uncles wedding wasnt
until next month Right

MOTHER
Its not your Uncles wedding they
are celebrating

Wajda looks up at her Mother suddenly Her eyes widen in
realization Wajda rushes over to hug her and they embrace

Her Mother sits them down and wraps her arms around Wajdas
head and shoulders as GUNSHOTS ring out in the distance Her
Mother wipes the tears from Wajdas eyes

MOTHER (CONTD)
Its all right He made his
decision Itll be only the two of
us now It will be fine

She strokes her daughter’s hair Wajda looks up determined
WAJDA

Lets buy the red dress and go over
there and get him

MOTHER
Theres no need for the red dress
anymore Besides I used that money
to buy you something else

She reaches over and flicks on the bare light-bulb on the
wall

The weak light falls directly on the corner of the roof
revealing

THE GREEN BICYCLE

MOTHER (CONTD)
I wanted to surprise you tomorrow
morning

Wajda stares at it in disbelief then looks over to her
Mother who smiles at her tenderly

MOTHER (CONTD)
I hope it’s the right one The
Shopkeeper said he has been holding
it for some spunky little girl for
weeks

They embrace each other and cry as fireworks continue behind
them

EXT THE NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - DAY 123

Wajda pedals through the neighborhood on her new green
bicycle The wind blows through her hair She slides to a
stop in front of her Grandmothers house She looks up at the
lights and remaining decorations She sighs and continues on

As she pulls away she sees Abdullah approach with a few other
boys She smiles at him He smiles back waves the others to
go on without him and pushes hard to catch up with her

As they pass the toy shop The Owner sits sipping tea in
front of the store chatting with another FRIEND

FRIEND
What is this music

As the children pass by The Owner smiles at Wajda His
friend looks at him in utter confusion

Wajda turns and pushes her bicycle ahead faster She looks
back to see if Abdullah is catching up to her

WAJDA
Catch me if you can

She passes by several BYSTANDERS who look at her
disapprovingly She holds out her arms proudly and steers the
bicycle without touching the handlebars smiling

Wajda breaks away and pedals until she reaches the end of the
road where the highway begins She slides to a stop looks
back and smiles to see Abdullah catching up to her then she
turns and stands watching the trucks and cars rumble by

FADE OUT
