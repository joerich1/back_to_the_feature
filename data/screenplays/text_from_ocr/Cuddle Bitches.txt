EXT MAX’S HOUSE - ESTABLISHING SHOT - MORNING

A sleek minimalist modern house It’s obvious that whoever
lives here has an eye and passion for architecture and
design His home stands out among the cozy ranch style
homes that populate the street

INT MAX’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING

An ALARM CLOCK reading 745 AM blares A hand reaches over
and slams the alarm off With the noise of the alarm gone a
light snoring is revealed

We pan over to see MAX DAVENPORT 30 - adorably charming and
sexy in a scruffy geek chic kind of way His eyes open and
stare at the source of the snoring BOB - Max’s very large
black Labrador Retriever - asleep under the covers with his
head on a pillow

He scratches Bob’s head attempting to wake him Bob lazily
opens one eye then promptly shuts it again

We pull out to reveal Max’s room - it is contemporary with
minimal modern furniture and natural hues The use of
mixing stone and wood and the use of lines to create a sexy
space that says “fuck me and then go home” without being too
overt

Max gives Bob a kiss on the snout and makes his way into
the

BATHROOM

Which is just as impressive as his bedroom The bathtub is a
free standing bowl next to a massive open stone shower

He walks to the mirror and stares at himself for a few
moments trying to figure out if he needs to shave He
decides against it and starts to brush his teeth but in the
middle of it he gets an urge to pee He wiggles through
spitting and dashes to the toilet where he sits down to
pee

INT SOPHIE and CHASE’S HOUSE - MORNING

A bright and airy bedroom On the bed sits SOPHIE WALSH 29 -
effortlessly gorgeous with enough sexy and spunk to make any
guy swoon She wears a baggy t-shirt and boxers and her hair
in a messy ponytail yet still manages to look incredibly

sexy
She watches CHASE LAURY 33 - cute but generic - as he goes
about the room getting ready for the day She jumps out of
bed and runs up behind him wrapping her arms around him

SOPHIE
Morning

CHASE
Happy birthday

He turns around and kisses her quickly on the top of the head
on his way to the dresser

SOPHIE
Can I have my present

CHASE
No and stop nagging me

SOPHIE
Well can we at least do it before
you leave

CHASE
Do what

SOPHIE
It

She gives a pelvic thrust mimicking sex Chase hardly even
gives her a glance

CHASE
I have a meeting in 30 minutes

SOPHIE
I’1l do a little tickle of the
balls thing and it’ll be like 30-60
seconds max

Sophie looks up at him hopefully He glances at his watch

then sighs apparently agreeing to the quickie She giggles
and jumps onto the bed

INT MAXS HOUSE - OFFICE - SAME

On the walls is are pictures of The Great Wall of China The
Wright House and China’s skyline The bookcases are full of
books on history of architecture architectural philosophy
ancient Chinese culture and feng shui
Max still in boxers sits down at his drafting table and
makes a quick note next to a very rough sketch of a
skyscraper that resembles a billowing flag The note reads
Zen garden atrium

INT MAXS HOUSE - KITCHEN -— CONTINUOUS

CAMMIE 24 - adorable and sassy - stands in the sleek modern
kitchen wearing one of Max’s work shirts and nothing else
making eggs

Max walks in and stops dead in his tracks when he sees Cammie
in his kitchen cooking

MAX
Hi

Cammie bounds over still holding the pan of eggs and gives
him a kiss nearly burning him in the processes

CAMMIE
Good morning I’m making
breakfast

MAX

I see that Did you sleep here

CAMMIE
No I went home and came back over
really early to make you
breakfast Yes I stayed here

MAX
In my bed

Max scratches his head trying to figure out if he was
trashed last night and somehow doesn’t remember this

CAMMIE
Well no that spot was occupied by
your boyfriend Bob who pulled me
out of the bed around midnight
Literally His teeth on my silk
teddy I had to sleep on the
couch

MAX
He’s a little possessive when it
comes to the bed You didn’t have
to stay over though
CAMMIE
Are you saying you wish I wasn’t
here right now

MAX
No

He means yes She kind of stares at him trying to read what
he’s really thinking

MAX (CONTD)
I just like to know when people are
sleeping in my house

CAMMIE
Well I was here when you fell
asleep

MAX

Yeah but I didn’t think you were
staying over because I said I had
an early meeting

CAMMIE
But you don’t

MAX
Yes I do

He doesn’t

CAMMIE
You got up at 745 An early
meeting is like I have to be up at
4 745 is sleeping in

MAX
I need a lot of sleep This is
early to me

CAMMIE
Oh

They stand in an awkward silence for a few moments

INT MAX’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - A LITTLE LATER

Through the glass we can see Max and Cammie going at it and
it sounds like she’s getting the fuck of her life

CAMMIE
Oh yeah you’re like a fucking
butterfly
Max looks at her quizzically then decides whatever he’1l
take it

HALLWAY - SAME

Sophie walks through the front door and hears Cammie right
away

CAMMIE (0S)

Yeah yeah yeah I’m winning
She rolls her eyes clearly this isn’t the first time she’s
heard Max getting it on with a girl Bob comes bounding out
of the bedroom and attacks her with a wagging tail and

kisses She leans down and gives him a kiss on the snout
then heads into the

KITCHEN

Where she pours herself a cup of coffee and sits down

CAMMIE (0OS)
Fuck me like a porn star

Sophie chuckles at the bizarre line then gets up and turns
the kitchen sink on turning it all the way to HOT

SOPHIE
No more hot water for those two
huh Bob-o

CAMMIE (0S)
Keep Going Almost There

Cammie’s screams getting louder and louder And then

CAMMIE (0S) (CONTD)
Rarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

Sophie nearly chokes on her coffee - who the hell growls like
a lion when they orgasm She’s gotta see who this girl is

She walks into the

HALLWAY

Where she leans against the wall sipping her coffee
nonchalantly Bob sits down next to her A moment later
Cammie walks out of the bathroom
She screams when she sees Sophie dropping the tiny bath
towel she was holding against her body Max follows her
wearing what only could be considered a bath “sheet”

MAX
Soph hey Happy birthday

He gives her a hug and a kiss on the cheek

SOPHIE
Didn’t mean to interrupt I just
came for my present

She grins

MAX
Nice try

Cammie stands awkwardly next to Max still naked and cupping
her boobs gaping at Sophie

Max goes into his

BEDROOM
Cammie stomps in after him

CAMMIE
Who the hell is that Are you
married Do you have a girlfriend
Are you a polygamist Max
Davenport

MAX
No to all of the above That’s
Sophie

CAMMIE
Yeah well who the hell is Sophie

MAX
My best friend

CAMMIE
Oh Like best friend used to be
my girlfriend best friend Best
friend I occasionally fuck best
friend

MAX
No known her since I was 9 never
fucked her best friend
CAMMIE
Oh

Max pulls on a shirt and pants and walks out of the room
leaving Cammie naked and still a bit thrown

INT MAXS HOUSE - KITCHEN -—- CONTINUOUS

Sophie hands Max one of the pieces of toast she’s buttering

SOPHIE
I feel like I should pay you for
that little show I just got

MAX
Shut up

SOPHIE
Rarr Rarr

She jokingly claws at Max’s chest

MAX
Jealous

SOPHIE
Obviously I can’t decide if I
like her Simba call or the “fuck me
like a porn star” better

MAX
You missed “youre like a fucking
butterfly”

Sophie doubles over laughing

SOPHIE
No

MAX
Yes

SOPHIE

I think I’m going to pee my pants

BATHROOM

Where Cammie is putting some of Max’s not-so-manly lotion on
her face Sophie dashes past her and plops down on the
toilet
SOPHIE
Sorry don’t mind me You don’t
have to leave I’m not a modest pee-
er

Cammie grows stiff as we hear Sophie start to pee

CAMMIE
Uhh no it’s okay I’1l leave

Cammie walks into the

KITCHEN

CAMMIE
Uh your friend started peeing in
front of me

MAX
Yeah she does that sometime

Cammie clearly thinks this is weird

CAMMIE
Do you want to have dinner tonight

Sophie returns to the room and hops up on the counter making
herself at home Cammie sees this and tenses up again

MAX
I can’t it’s Sophie’s birthday

CAMMIE
Oh

She looks over at Sophie swinging her legs of the edge of
the counter and sticking her hand into a bag of Captain
Crunch Bob begging at her feet Max is rather oblivious to
Cammie’s growing discomfort

CAMMIE (CONTD)
Okay Well I’1l see you later
Well do Friday

MAX
Yeah maybe I’11 call you

She gives Max a deep kiss goodbye as if trying to mark her
territory and leaves

MAX (CONTD)
We’re not doing Friday She slept
over
SOPHIE
God forbid one of them managed to
sneak a few snuggles in

MAX
Snuggling is like a 10th date
thing And Bob sleeps in my bed
so she slept on the couch Don’t
you think that seems a bit
desperate And that couch is not
made for sleeping She better not
have drooled on it

Sophie rolls her eyes as Max makes his way over to his giant
modern white leather sectional to inspect it for drool

SOPHIE
Let’s talk about me I think Chase
is going to propose tonight

MAX
Really Why do you think that

SOPHIE
I checked his google history for
the last month and he’s been
hitting up the jewelry websites
hard core

MAX
Sometimes those are a front for
porn sites Like tiffanyscom
instead of tiffanycom

SOPHIE
Really Is that true

MAX
I donno whitehousecom is a porn
site At least it was when I was

SOPHIE
Why are you trying to burst my
happy bubble

MAX
What happened to the element of
surprise

SOPHIE
I was surprised when I found his
google history

Max rolls his eyes and Sophie sneers back at him then checks
her watch

SOPHIE (CONTD)
I gotta go I have an open house in
an hour and I have to set up the
signs still You’re really not
gonna give me my present

MAX
Nope I’m teaching you the art of
patience

SOPHIE

I don’t have any

MAX
I know

She gives him a hug and Max chuckles to himself as he watches
her leave

INT OPEN HOUSE - DAY

Sophie escorts a rich looking middle aged couple LISA and
MIKE out of a large Spanish style home

SOPHIE
Are you working with an agent or
have you just started to look

MIKE
We just started looking

SOPHIE
Well let me give you my card and
call me if you need someone to help
you look

Mike and Lisa exchange a look

MIKE
Have you been in the business long

SOPHIE
About six years

LISA
You just look really young Have
you sold many houses

SOPHIE
Yeah I mean I’ve spent some time
working with other agents building
up relationships with clients and
contractors and whatnot Just the
route I wanted to take starting

out

LISA
Mm hmm Well thanks for showing us
around

MIKE

Yes thanks

They smile and head out Sophie looks down at her hand
she’s still holding her business card her face falls

INT MAXS OFFICE - DAY

A small contemporary office very much in Max’s taste with a
desk a drafting table and a couch

Max in designer jeans a button down shirt and no shoes
lounges on the couch feet up reading “Architects
Newspaper”

His co-worker EVAN 31 - chubby cheery and looks like
someone you’d expect to spend a lot of time smoking weed -
walks in followed by JASON 30 - cute dorky and goofy They
shut the door behind them take their shoes off then both
break into grins

EVAN
Banging Cammie down in legal
Nice High five

When Max doesn’t give him a high five Evan lifts Max’s hand
and does it himself

EVAN (CONTD)
So how was she Was she kinky I
feel like she’d be kinky for some
reason She’s so innocent looking
that I feel like she’d just be
like “ooooh Max tie me to the bed
with a leather strap and do me in
the ass”

MAX
That did not happen

EVAN
Is that a yes she was kinky just
not that kinky

Max shrugs

JASON
Brooke blocked all the porn sites
and I haven’t had sex in 4 months
and there are still 4 till the
wedding give me the damn kinky
details Max

MAX
You know you don’t need porn to
jerk off right

JASON
(depressed)
It’s not the same

EVAN
Okay just give us a number on the
kink-o-meter

Max considers for a moment

MAX

Jason gasps in delight an image surely flashing in his mind

EVAN
I knew it Man wow

Evan takes a moment to imagine the scenario then snaps back
to reality

EVAN (CONTD)
I’m totally going to jerk off to
what I think she’s doing at a 6
after lunch

MAX
I’m guessing you didn’t hook up
with her friend last night

EVAN
You get them on your dick by like
oh my how I love buildings they’re
like the female body and they’re
like love all unique” and blah
blah

Max laughs

EVAN (CONTD)
Well the applicable properties of
Fibonacci sequence to a staircase
that runs ten floors does not get
the girls on their knees Math is
just not sexy

JASON
That and your spare tire

Evan shrugs it’s true that’s not helping his matters

MAX
I wish I were an integral so I
could be the space under your
curves

EVAN
Yeah I found that on google too
and it didn’t work She asked me
what an integral was which is
really annoying because who the
hell in this day and age doesn’t
know what an integral is

JASON
I don’t

Evan glares at Jason for a few seconds and then whacks him on
the back of the head

EVAN
F(x)dx Signed area on xy plane
Bounded by £ Nothing

JASON
No

He looks to Max exasperated

EVAN
You know what it is right
MAX
Eh more or less More less
though
JASON

So we’re going to the bar tonight
right Brooke’s out with her mom
tonight so I can stay till 830

MAX
I can’t tonight it’s Sophie’s
birthday We have dinner at her
sister’s

EVAN
Why don’t I get invited to these
things I love her Like I’m in
love with her I would comfort her
vagina even if it was menstruating

MAX
Because you say disturbing shit
like that

EVAN
She’s just so hot And her
boobies

He grabs the air and closes his eyes imagining that he’s
feeling someone up

MAX
You better not get a boner right
now

EVAN

C’mon I know you think about her
when you’re jerking off Imagine
pulling her little lace thong off
with your teeth Even Jason lets
her slip in there occasionally

JASON
It’s true Don’t judge me I
don’t have access to porn

MAX
Do you think about your sister when
youre jerking off

EVAN
I will admit that one time just
once she did creep in there for a
second I’m not proud of it but
I’‘ll admit it But Sophie isn’t
your sister and she’s ridiculously
hot And I’1l never understand how
you can look at her hot ass and not
picture it naked slapping against
your balls as she rides your cock
cowgirl style Nor will anyone
else because everyone is thinking
what I’m thinking

(MORE)

EVAN (CONTD)
And someday your balls will drop
and you will too

MAX
I don’t think so

JASON
It could happen

Max laughs and shakes his head

EVAN
The fact is Max she isn’t your
sister so there are no legal
ramifications or societal norms to
keep your brain from someday
processing the fact that she’s hot
and bone-able Just wait

MAX
You need to spend less time
thinking about my sex life

WALTER GREEN 60s - friendly faced and a bit overweight -
pokes his head in the doorway

WALTER
Maxwell we’d like to see you in
Russ’ office
Max stands up and follows Walter out of his office Evan and
Jason watch him as he goes thinking maybe he’s in trouble

RUSS MILLER’S OFFICE

RUSS MILLER 60s - straightlaced no bullshit kind of guy -
sits in his very large office Models of skyscrapers arenas
and office buildings sit on tables and hang on the walls as
well as awards He is clearly the head honcho of the office

RUSS
Max great Have a seat

Walter takes a seat next to Russ and Max sits across from
them

RUSS (CONTD)
Here’s the deal We’ve took a look
at your hotel proposal for Seattle
and we thought it was a bit vulvic--

MAX
Huh

RUSS
Vulvic Vulva Like the part of a
female

MAX
Uh

Russ holds up a board with a picture of Max’s building It’s
a pretty standard diamond shaped skyscraper Max isn’t
getting it so Russ shows him the birds eye view Now he sees
it but it’s really a stretch to call it a vulvic reference

MAX (CONTD)
I did not realize that

WALTER
Well sometimes you need dirty old
men to find where youve
subconsciously used to female
genitalia as inspiration Anyway
Waterford loved it and they want
you for their new skyscraper in
Shanghai

Max’s mouth drops

MAX
The Shanghai Skyscraper The big
one

RUSS
Yep

Max is in total disbelief

MAX
Really

WALTER
No actually were firing you and
we thought we’d have some fun
before it

Walter and Russ look at each other totally serious for a few
momens and then burst into laughs

WALTER (CONTD)
Yes seriously

MAX
Wow
RUSS

Anyway congratulations kid
Stella will be your assistant and
will get your first meeting set up
with the investors in a couple of
weeks Consult with Evan for the
structural engineering and Jason
for the interiors like usual

MAX
Stella like Dave’s secretary
Stella

WALTER

Assistant We don’t like to
perpetuate the negative stereotypes
of women just being a secretary
with no sight of promotion But
yes Daves Stella

MAX
Doesn’t Dave need Stella

RUSS
No I don’t think Dave will be
needing Stella

Walter shakes his head in agreement

MAX
Oh okay

WALTER
But just to be clear about the
whole assistant thing she’s not
actually to help you do any work on
the project per se Just more of
supporting your schedule bringing
you your coffee sharpening your
pencil type of assistant

MAX
Right Got it

Russ and Walter both stand up and shake Max’s hand

RUSS
Well alrighty then I assume you
know that we’ve spent considerable
time on this account and with the
economy right now this is a really
important project

(MORE)

RUSS (CONTD)
You fuck this up and we’re out 100
million bucks and probably our
firm so you know no pressure

MAX
Right Of course Thanks

He nods a thanks and leaves the room Once he’s out of their
sight line he does a dorky little celebratory dance

INT MAX’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Max walks in the back door which leads into the kitchen and
is greeted by Bob his tail wagging so fiercely he knocks one
of the kitchen chairs over

MAX
Hi buddy

Bob jumps on him and starts licking his face

MAX (CONTD)
Yes you’re a good boy aren’t you

Max kneels down on the ground and starts wrestling with him

INT MAX’S HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER

Max and Bob are still wrestling on the ground but now there
is a a rope involved Sophie walks in the back door and
smiles when she sees Max and Bob rolling around on the floor

SOPHIE
Hey

MAX
Hey

When Bob sees her he forgets how much he wants Max’s rope
and darts over to Sophie He takes a giant leap and nearly
jumps on her white shirt but she meets his chest with her
knee Bob immediately sits and waits for her to pet him

SOPHIE
Where are your manners Mr

She leans over and pets Bob She tries to keep him from
licking her face but quickly gives in

SOPHIE (CONTD)
I love you too Bobo You ready

MAX
Yep I got a contract today A
skyscraper in Shanghai 100
Million dollar project

He’s trying to act cool about it but Sophie can tell he’s
psyched

SOPHIE
Holy shit Max Oh my god that’s
awesome This is like your dream

MAX
I know And I get a new office and
a secretary

Sophie frowns

SOPHIE
I hope you haven’t slept with her
because that could be awkward if
she has to send flowers to another
girl you’re sleeping with

MAX
Why is that the first thing you
always think of I’m not as slutty
as you think

SOPHIE
Youre probably way sluttier than I
think I’m still waiting for my
present by the way

Max pulls and envelope out of his pocket and hands it to her
SOPHIE (CONT’D)
This is it Just this It’s not
money is it
MAX
Stop judging it before you even
open it

Sophie grins and opens it up it’s a pair of concert tickets

SOPHIE
No

MAX
Yep

SOPHIE
Garth Brooks Seriously I
thought they sold out in the first
10 minutes

MAX
They did I was one of those dorks
that got up early and was online at
exactly 700am

She’s touched and gives him a hug

SOPHIE

You’re coming with me right
MAX

Yep So actually I need one of

those back

He playfully rips one out of her hand and puts it in a drawer
and they head out of the house

INT LUCY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The house is cute and tastefully decorated but rather messy
Sophie Chase Sophie’s sister LUCY 32 - bubbly pretty and
pregnant - and her husband JACK 34 - ruggedly handsome -
stand around chatting in the living room

Sophie holds Lucy’s baby ADDY and is clearly a natural with
her Max is surprisingly playful and natural with the baby
cooing at her in Sophie’s arms

Sophie whispers something to Lucy and Lucy squeals and
whispers something back Sophie’s face goes serious

SOPHIE
No Luc

LUCY
Relax I’1ll be polite and it’1l
come up naturally

Lucy turns to Chase

LUCY (CONT’D)
Can I talk to you for a minute

CHASE
Uh okay

She nods for them to move over a few feet but they’re still
within hearing range from the others

LUCY
I know what you’re planning on
doing tonight and I would’ve liked
it if you’d come to me first

CHASE
Uhhhh wait what

LUCY
I’m very protective of my sister
and since our dad is dead I think
it wouldve been proper for you to
ask me for permission to

Sophie grins over at Chase getting increasingly more
excited Jack and Max watch Chase shift his weight around
uncomfortably waiting to see what he says

CHASE
Uh no Shit This is awkward

LUCY
Yes it is because I really liked
you and now I feel a little awkward
that you would feel it was
unnecessary to ask for my
permission before you ask her to be
your lawfully wedded wife I’m
kinda offended that you overlooked
me

CHASE
But I wasn’t yeah this is
really awkward Umm

SOPHIE
Luc you’re making him
uncomfortable He probably wants
to do it without an audience

Chase has become increasingly more horrified at the situation
and begins to sweat

CHASE
No um god fuck me Sophie
it’s just that I wasn’t planning on
asking that particular question
Sophie stops dead and stares at him

SOPHIE
But your google history

Max steps in between Sophie and Chase

MAX
Wait a second here You weren’t
going to ask her tonight or
ever

Chase looks away

CHASE
Ever Shit I know I’m sorry
Soph
Max pushes Chase
MAX

What the fuck dude

JACK
Yeah what the fuck man

CHASE
I mean I just met someone else a
few months ago and it just didn’t
seem like the right time to you
know break up with you

He turns to Sophie apologetic and embarrassed Sophie
stares at him in shock on the verge of tears but a little
too shocked to cry at the moment

Lucy and Jack both step forward as if they’re about to say
something to Chase but Max clearly has it under control

MAX
And you thought her birthday was
the right occasion

Max takes a step forward getting in Chase’s face

CHASE
No but I was just put in a really
awkward position and I’m sorry
Really I am We had a great thing
and I do like you It just wasn’t
exactly the right fit for me and I
found someone who really opened up
my spiritual side and it really
made a difference

Sophie stands up and walks over to Chase and stands right in
front of him She looks like she’s about to cry and then she

knees him in the balls as hard as she can He screams and
falls to the ground in pain

CHASE (CONT’D)

(through clenched teeth)
Sophie you know I have a short
urethra and any direct blunt force
trauma to my perineum could make me
sterile

SOPHIE
Shit I forgot

She takes another swipe at him this time with her foot He
yelps in pain again Max grabs one of his arms and starts
dragging him towards the door Jack grabs the other and
together they drag him out of the house and throw him down
the porch stairs

Lucy pulls Sophie away from the door and puts her arm around
her Max walks up and puts his arm around her as well
rubbing her back to calm her down

SOPHIE (CONTD)
I gave him a blow job this morning
On my birthday Who accepts a blow
job from their girlfriend on her
birthday

LUCY

The same kind of guy that irons his
underwear

INT BAR - NIGHT

Max and Sophie sit at the bar both pretty wasted

SOPHIE
I hate men I really really hate
them Except for you But you
don’t really count But you kind
of do because you’re all like
fucking girls without having them
be your girlfriend and that’s
shitty Max But it’s awesome and I
love you for being sick since
youre my Max But if I wasn’t
your bff and I was just speaking
about how much I hate men then
youd fall into that category

MAX
So if you didn’t like me youd
hate me
SOPHIE
Exactly

MAX
Good to know

SOPHIE
But seriously Maxwell you need to
do something about your kind
because I’m sad and lonely And
horny And now I have to live
alone I hate living alone

MAX
You wanna live with me
SOPHIE
Really
MAX
Why not
SOPHIE

But what about all you have going
on in that place With the
females

MAX
Youve certainly been around for
that before

SOPHIE
Rarrrrrr That was awesome you
should bring her by more often

MAX
I feel like she might be clingy
after the whole breakfast incident

SOPHIE
I think you need clingy every once
and a while Takes the douche out
of you

MAX
I am not a douche I’m just driven
and I love my job and I have things
I want to accomplish I don’t have
time to focus on a relationship

SOPHIE
What I just heard was blah blah
blah “I have intimacy issues”

MAX

SOPHIE
Yes And when you let go of that
and stop treating women like a blow
up sex doll you’1ll be a good
family man Maybe If you get
over the whole being a slut thing
Which probably won’t or can’t

Max sneers

MAX
I think you need to step out of the
box where the guys iron their
underwear And stop dating guys
that you think are safe and won’t
hurt you because it’s not working

SOPHIE
I hate you I hope you know that
You slut

Max shrugs and takes a sip of his beer

INT MAX’S HOUSE - NIGHT

The house is covered in boxes random pieces of furniture a
sharp contrast to Max’s typically very tidy bachelor pad

Max and Sophie sit on the couch her head on his shoulder
watching £T Extraterrestrial They each have a bottle of
wine in their hand All of a sudden Sophie sticks her
index finger up and puts it on Max’s nose

SOPHIE
Ouchhh

Max doesn’t get it
SOPHIE (CONT’D)
Ouchhh I’m ET I’m heeling

you

Max starts laughing and then puts his index finger on her
heart

MAX
Ouchhh

They both burst into laughs and Max puts his arm around her
and pulls her closer

INT MAX’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER

Max is fast asleep in bed Bob next to him with his head on a
pillow again Sophie opens the door and peaks in

SOPHIE
(whispers)
Max

He doesn’t answer so she comes into the room and stands next
to the bed

SOPHIE (CONTD)
(a little louder)
Max

He stirs but doesn’t wake up

SOPHIE (CONT’D)
Max

He opens an eye

SOPHIE (CONTD)
Are you asleep

MAX
Uh huh

SOPHIE
I can’t sleep because I keep
thinking about how I want to murder
Chase Do you want to play
Scrabble

He groggily lifts his head up Is she kidding Nope

SOPHIE (CONTD)
I’m feeling especially logophilic

MAX
I don’t know that word

SOPHIE
It means “Lover of Words” I just
learned it In the Scrabble
dictionary

MAX
Go back to sleep

SOPHIE
I can’t I haven’t slept alone in
like 4 years and the absence of a
Chase is bringing up homicidal
thoughts

Max sighs and flips the comforter up

MAX
Cmon

Sophie smiles and slips in next to him and curls up against
him putting her head on his chest Max rubs her back in
attempt to calm her Sophie giggles

MAX (CONTD)
What

SOPHIE
Nothing It’s just you’re my
cuddle bitch

MAX
Your what

SOPHIE
My cuddle bitch It’s an honor
trust me

She pats his chest and closes her eyes Max keeps his eyes

open a few moments longer considering what she just said
then close them and goes back to sleep

INT MAXS HOUSE - MORNING

Sophie lays on Max’s bed looking at her boxes and things
stuffed into this room Her face is red and she’s clearly
been crying She takes a deep breath and gets out of bed
heading into the

BATHROOM

Where there is a towel on the counter and a sticky note on
the mirror that reads Clean your crap up Cuddle Bitch

Sophie laughs and pulls it down

INT MAXS OFFICE - LATER

Max has some rough sketches a few different ideas for the
skyscraper on his desk

His designs are all similar in that he’s playing around with
the building’s shape and geometric designs on the outside

Evan and Jason sit in the chairs in front of his desk
staring at him

JASON
That’s awesome about the proposal
and all but--

EVAN
What the shit is a cuddle bitch

Max shrugs

EVAN (CONTD)

Because neither of those words
infer good things Cuddle - um
well that involves no penetration
And Bitch - that’s like your her
tool So you’re her tool that
doesn’t get to penetrate her Way
to go Max that sounds awesome

He gives Max a sarcastic thumbs up

MAX
Why do you only think in terms of
sex
EVAN
Because I’m Evan
JASON
This sounds like a bad idea Max
MAX
Why
JASON

Because she’s single and she’s
never been single and we don’t know
what will happen if she’s suddenly
single and in your house and--

EVAN
To put it in man terms you can’t
press your dick against girl’s ass
without it one day realizing that 2
inches away is a delightful pussy
Or an asshole whichever you
prefer

MAX
My dick knows it’s not interested
in Sophie’s pussy

JASON
What about her other hole

MAX
It’s not interested in her asshole
either Or anyone’s asshole for
that matter

EVAN
Really Not even once

MAX
Why would I want to stick my dick
into the most bacteria filled
orifice of someone’s body

JASON

I agree Exit only
EVAN

Id try it
JASON

Youd try anything

EVAN
That’s true

Jason turns back to Max

JASON

Have you carefully considered the
repercussions this is going to have
on your lifestyle Youve gone
from the ultimate kick ass bachelor
to living with a very domestically
inclined woman who you may or may
not have suppressed feelings for

EVAN
It’s like one big fat vagina cock-
blocker

MAX

I’m pretty sure you’re forgetting
that Sophie is like the coolest
chick in the world And I think
Id know if I had suppressed
feelings for her

He nods for emphasis but he’s clearly thinking about what
they’ve been saying

JASON
That’s what you thought before you
let her move in

MAX

I think you two are way over
analyzing this

INT LUCY’S CAR - DAY

LUCY
What do you mean you’re going to
live with him

SOPHIE

I mean I am living with Max
LUCY

Do you have a cock in your ear
SOPHIE

What
LUCY

Are you fucked in the brain I
just thought of it last night

SOPHIE
And youve been waiting to use it

Lucy grins

LUCY
My point is you can’t live with a
boy cuddle with him and expect sex
to not get involved at some point

SOPHIE
Why would sex get involved It’s
Max

LUCY

Yeah well believe it or not Max
wants to fuck you He may not know
it yet but he does And I’m not
saying there’s anything wrong with
it because you’re fuckable and he’s
really fuckable and I actually --
and Jack agrees with this-- think
that you two should fuck

(MORE )

LUCY (CONTD)
Because Max is awesome you love
Max He’s hot he likes babies
he’s already your best friend Get
where I’m going here

SOPHIE
Are we talking about the same Max
that sleeps with girls and never
calls them again

LUCY
Get over that

SOPHIE
I’m not having sex with Max

LUCY
Well then when this weird cuddling
bitch living situation goes sour
don’t come crying to me Because
if you don’t think you’re ever
going to love him you shouldn’t be
putting your boobies on his chest
and listening to his heartbeat
That’s weird But it’s even
weirder to live with a guy you’re
not interested in when youre 30

SOPHIE
He’s my best friend It’s not that
weird You’re just too small
minded to understand the notion of
having a best friend that is a guy
And I’m 29

LUCY
Every guy wants to fuck every
attractive girl It’s hard wired
into their dicks which is what
controls their brains

Sophie rolls her eyes at her sister and looks out the window
at the open house they’re in front of

LUCY (CONTD)
Now go find someone in there to
sell some houses to This is a
whole new start to your life with
Chase out of the picture Yay

Sophie sighs and gets out of the car

INT MAX’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Max comes home with a bag of books from Borders He stops in
the foyer and looks around it’s a disaster Sophie’s boxes
are everywhere and clothes are flung on tables and chairs

He goes to flip off the light in the bathroom and sees wet
towels on the floor and a mini flood in his shower He sighs
heavily before putting the towels on the rack and checking
out the shower situation There’s a shallow pool of water
sitting in the base due to a pile of hair mixed with soap
scum sitting in the drain He reluctantly pulls it out a
disgusted look on his face and tosses it in the trash then
puts some toilet paper over it He shuts the light off and
heads into the

KITCHEN

Where Sophie is hunched over the stove making dinner Bob
lays at her feet

MAX
Hey

SOPHIE
Hi

He puts the bag on the table and pulls out a big stack of
books on how to be a successful real estate agent and how to
attract clients

MAX
So I got you some stuff to help
you get some business

Sophie turns around and sees the stack of books

SOPHIE
You didn’t have to do that

She starts flipping through the books and then hugs him

MAX
I wanted to help you turn over a
new real estate leaf

He smiles down at Sophie and gives her a pat on the back

MAX (CONTD)
And I’m hoping this is the best
dinner of my life so Ill forgive
you for single handedly destroying
my house in 1 day

Sophie smiles guiltily as she looks at the kitchen which
really is a complete disaster

INT MAXS HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

Max has a silly satisfied smile on his face It looks like
he’s just finished having sex

MAX
Wow

SOPHIE
I know

We pull back to see he’s at the kitchen table and has licked
his plate clean

MAX
How did I not know you cooked

Sophie gives a sly shrug and retreats to the living room
SOPHIE
Hurry up and do the dishes so we
can watch The Bachelor
MAX
Or football

INT MAX’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

Sophie lies on the couch her legs across Max’s body as they
watch “The Bachelor” They’re both drinking beer and
thoroughly engrossed in the show Max surprisingly more so
than Sophie

MAX
She’s a money grubbing prostitute
how can he pick her What’s wrong
with Kelly She’s perfect

SOPHIE
She’s a 32A

MAX
So what now all of sudden we pick
the stupid trampy girls over the
awesome ones because they have
small boobs This guy is a retard
I don’t like him Can we vote HIM
off

Sophie laughs Max glances over and grins at her

MAX (CONTD)
This is fun

SOPHIE
Well yeah I am pretty awesome
company
They high five and Max rests his hand on Sophie’s knee and
they turn their attention back to the TV
UNDER MUSIC

QUICK SCENES OF THEM ENJOYING THEIR CUDDLE BITCH RELATIONSHIP

-BAR Max and Sophie check out girls together Sophie
points to one and Max nods that she’s not too bad Sophie
winks and goes over to the girl and points Max out to her
Max shies back a tiny bit and waves an awkward hello then to
his surprise she starts walking towards him

-CLOSE ON Sophie’s face she has a pillow clamped over her
head trying to block out the noise of Max and the girl from
the bar going at it like crazy

-MAX’S Max comes home from work exhausted tossing his
briefcase on a table and kicking off his shoes

MAX
I need a beer and a massage

Sophie holds up a beer from the couch He takes the beer and
plops down in front of her locking into the spooning
position

SOPHIE
This isn’t how it works

MAX
I want to be the spoon

SOPHIE
Youre too big to be the spoon

They both laugh as she tries to clamber over him battling
for the spoon spot

-RESTAURANT We watch Max and Sophie eating and laughing An
older couple smiles at them as if noting that they’re a cute
couple

-MAX’S HOUSE Max is banging another girl Sophie now has a
pair of Bose noise eliminating headphones on and is humming
loudly

-MAXS Max hunches over his computer in his home office
working on his skyscraper design Sophie comes in and hands
him a cup of coffee then sits down on the couch and starts
flipping through one of the real estate books

-STREET Max and Sophie jog on the sidewalk Sophie holding
Bob’s leash

MAX
Fire hydrant be aware

SOPHIE
Huh

She barely has time to respond before Bob takes off towards a
red fire hydrant ahead of them When he reaches it instead
of peeing on it he starts humping it Sophie gasps and tries
to pull him off

SOPHIE (CONTD)
Bob no Bad boy No hump

Max reaches them and chuckles

SOPHIE (CONTD)
This isn’t funny it’s disgusting

She gasps even louder

SOPHIE (CONTD)
Ew gross his thing is out

Max continues to chuckle

MAX
He’s just releasing a little sexual
energy If he can’t bone he might
as well rub

SOPHIE
Does he still have his balls

MAX
Um yeah Would you remove your
son’s balls

SOPHIE
My son won’t be running around the
neighborhood humping fire hydrants
(MORE )

SOPHIE (CONTD)
And he won’t have four legs and be
a dog

MAX
He needs his balls they’re what
make him a man

SOPHIE
Well you might have to reconsider
if this becomes a problematic
habit

MAX
Never it’s cruel and inhumane

He pats Bob on the head as he finishes up humping the fire
hydrant Sophie is still grossed out

-PARTY Sophie lingers next to Max who is talking to MAYA
29 - exotically beautiful in an undeniable way Sophie takes
food from every passing waiter and sips on a glass of
champagne She’s clearly a bit annoyed that Max is ignoring
her

MAYA
So did you always know you wanted
to be an architect

MAX
I went to Italy when I was 18 and--

MAYA
The Roman architecture

MAX
No actually I was in a little
country village and every home was
built by hand and the details were
so amazing I realized that every
building has it’s own story and
something that makes it unique
They have their own secrets and
energy and all these stories
They’re very much a reflection of
humans But it was really when
visiting China that I found my
style

Sophie is listening to this and cannot believe what she’s
hearing She stares at him aghast and sees Maya hanging on
every word he’s saying It’s like she just fell in love with
him Sophie tugs at Max’s arm

SOPHIE
I have to pee

MAX
Ok

SOPHIE
Come with me

MAX
No

SOPHIE

You said you wouldn’t leave me

MAX
Don’t you think you can handle
peeing on your own

Max turns his attention back to Maya Sophie glares at him
for a moment then turns to Maya

SOPHIE
He’s going to fuck you and probably
never call you again so just so
you know

She drunkenly stomps away to the bathroom

MAX
I’m sorry I should go talk to her
It was nice meeting you though

-STREET Still in their clothes from the party Max and
Sophie walk down the street arm and arm eating ice cream
and laughing

SOPHIE
I’ve never seen girls go down
easier

MAX

She didn’t go down

SOPHIE
She was like about to drool was
dripping out of her mouth like
“oooh I wanna suck you off right
now” You should write a book - a
modern architects guide to getting
any girl to suck and swallow

MAX
Contemporary architect Don’t ever
call me modern

SOPHIE
Is there a difference

Max nearly keels over

MAX
Is there a difference Modern
architecture is more of form
follows function A contemporary
architect is someone who has lots
of influences but still has visions
and aspirations and isn’t afraid to
try risky ventures and use
different materials in innovative
ways I’m all into the mixing of
materials stone with wood and
taking the risks and trying
something new that’s never been
done before That’s why I love it
Not to just turn out carbon copy
modern homes that have no
originality or soul

SOPHIE
Right I got it and will never make
that error again

MAX
Good

He smiles and they continue down the street

-MAX’S Max and Sophie are both in the kitchen getting their
morning coffee and breakfast They hand things off to each
other without asking and make two of everything They
clearly have developed a morning routine and enjoy having
breakfast together

-MAXS OFFICE Evan is frustrated as he explains his
mathematics Max get’s a text from Sophie that says ouuuch
and laughs He starts texting back while Evan talks

EVAN
If you want to do it like a Jenga
game then we’re going to need to
have a huge supports running down
each side or have a massive center
beam that is like the size of a
skyscraper itself in order to
support all the differentiated
weight distribution

MAX
Not that small like giant jenga
pieces 10 floors per piece

Evan is not pleased to hear this

EVAN
Then why the fuck did I just spent
3 days figuring this out

MAX
It took you like ten minutes

EVAN
So it’s annoying and disrespectful-

Max is chuckling at his phone again Evan frowns and grabs
Max’s phone He reads the text and throws it back at him

EVAN (CONTD)
Stop playing cuddle bitch and pay
attention if you want to get this
proposal If you’re going to do 10
floor pieces jutting then you can’t
go out further than 5 feet
otherwise the boom half the
building is on the rest of Shanghai
and people are not happy

Max is half listening to Evan and half staring at the
blinking green light on his phone waiting for it to turn red

-MAXS Max and Sophie sit on the floor Bob draped across
Sophie’s lap playing Scrabble and drinking wine Sophie
puts a word on the board

SOPHIE

Max leans over to see what word could’ve earned that many
points

MAX
Muzjiks

Sophie grins

MAX (CONTD)
Ive never heard of that word

SOPHIE
It’s an alternate spelling for a
Russian peasant

MAX
You don’t get to study the scrabble
dictionary and then use words that
you don’t really know

SOPHIE
Hey if you take the time to study
the dictionary you’ve earned the
right to use the word

Max rolls his eyes and playfully throws the dictionary at
her

-MAXS OFFICE Max hard at work on his proposal designs

-OPEN HOUSE Sophie watches a young couple leave her
business card still in her hand again

MAN
She seemed perfectly nice

WOMAN
I am not letting you have a hot
real estate agent so you can stare
at her tits and dream of boning her
while we’re looking at houses to
raise our family in This is why
most real estate agents are unkept
women in their mid 40s And that’s
who we’re going to get to sell us a
house

MAN
Way to think outside of the box

WOMAN
I would if you’d keep your eyes in
the box but you can’t handle that

SOPHIE
I can hear you you know

The woman looks back and sneers then quickly drags her
husband away

-PARK Bob bounds ahead of Sophie and Max as they hike up a
trail Bob keeps stopping waiting for them to catch up
before he bounds ahead again

MAX
You don’t need to change careers

SOPHIE
Ive been at it 6 years Max What
am I going to do

MAX
You need to find a young single
guy to sell a house to They’d
pick the hot young agent over an
old cougar any day Or a gay
couple Gay guys love pretty
girls

Sophie isn’t so convinced Max puts his arm around her and
gives her a kiss on the head

MAX (CONTD)
Youre going to be fine I promise

They continue up the hill his arm still around her

-MAX’S HOUSE Max has the guys over to watch a football
game Sophie brings over a plate of homemade tortilla chips
and homemade salsa

MAX (CONTD)
Oh thanks

SOPHIE
Yup

She sits down next to him on the couch leaning against him

MAX
I’m totally betting on every game
next year it makes it so much more
exciting

SOPHIE
And so begins the gambling problem

JASON
And the drinking problem

MAX
And the domestic violence
problem

SOPHIE

How about we don’t waste all of our
money gambling on stupid football
games

She gives him a sarcastic smile and leaves the room the guys
eyes following her as she goes

MAX
Is she mad at me

Jason and Evan nod

EVAN
I now fully understand the cuddle
bitch relationship She makes you
fresh salsa then tells you not to
gamble You Max Davenport got a
wife

Max thinks about it for a few moments then hesitantly laughs
it off

END MUSIC

INT MAX’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Max stands in front of his closet flipping through his dress
shirts He seems to be looking for one in particular but
can’t find it

He grabs his phone from the night stand and dials

Intercut as needed with

INT LUCY’S HOUSE - SAME

Sophie sits at the dinner table with Lucy Jack and Addy when
her cell phone rings

SOPHIE
Hey

Hey do you know where my green
Hugo Boss shirt

that has the weird neck dimension

MAX
The one that’s a large

SOPHIE

END INTERCUT
Sophie hangs up the phone and continues eating

SOPHIE
Max says hi
Lucy and Jack look at each other and then at Sophie

JACK
Soo How come you don’t iron my
shirts Luc

LUCY
Because I pushed a bowling ball out
of my vagina for you and am about
to do it again If I’m gonna do
that you can iron your own shirts

JACK
Fair enough

LUCY
So why do you iron Max’s shirts

SOPHIE
If I didn’t he’d send them out to
dry clean and that’s just a
ridiculous waste of money

LUCY
A waste of his money Not yours
His Which is not yours

Sophie shrugs

SOPHIE
I don’t mind doing it I find it
relaxing

LUCY

No one finds ironing relaxing it’s
the biggest pain in the ass ever
That’s why they created dry
cleaners because it’s such a huge
pain in the ass you don’t mind
spending absurd amounts of money to
not have to do it

SOPHIE
I kinda like it

JACK
Really Can I give you my shirts
I hate ironing

SOPHIE
No

LUCY
Why not At least he’s semi-
related to you

SOPHIE
Why am I getting the third degree
about ironing

JACK
I think because it’s weird To you
know iron a man’s shirts when

youre not doing it with him
like it sex not it the ironing

SOPHIE
I got that

Lucy nods in agreement

LUCY
When’s the last time you got laid

Sophie shrugs

SOPHIE
I just haven’t really felt like
dating since Chase

LUCY
Were setting you up Do you know
anyone that’d be good for her

JACK
Probably some guys at work

SOPHIE
I don’t want to date an engineer

JACK
What’s wrong with engineers

LUCY
Are you trying to insinuate that my
husband is a boring science loser

JACK
Do you think I’m a boring science
loser

Lucy smiles and kisses him

LUCY
No baby Only when you talk about
work

(MORE )

LUCY (CONTD)
(Beat)
Were setting you up Soph

Lucy and Jack nod in agreement then kiss in an annoyingly
cute way Sophie sighs and sinks into her chair As she
watches them laugh and give each other pecks a wave of
sadness washes over her face

INT RESTAURANT - NIGHT

An expensive steak house Max Evan and Russ sit in a booth
drinking a bottle of wine and eating steak

EVAN
I gotta piss like a racehorse on
steroids I’11 be back

MAX
Classy Evan

Evan shrugs and leaves

RUSS
You know Max it’s all happening
for you right now This is a huge
deal for someone your age to get
this proposal and if they go for
it you’ll be looking at big things
in your very near future If
everything goes well with this
were going to be looking at you
for partner

MAX
Really wow I had no idea you
were even considering a new
partner

He’s ecstatic he can’t believe what he’s hearing

RUSS
Let me give you a piece of advice
Max We’re at the cutting edge of
this cut throat industry Long
hours hard work lots of money
lots of traveling huge projects
And youre going to do huge things
living your dream But none of
that is really worth anything if
you don’t have someone to come home
to and share your good news with
Do you have someone to share your
news with

MAX
Kinda

RUSS
How do you kinda You either do or
you don’t

MAX
I do but it’s not like she’s my
wife

RUSS

She’s your girlfriend

MAX
No not really

RUSS
Oh I see One of those weird
relationship things you kids have
these days where it is a
relationship but it’s not because
you don’t want to define anything
because defining it would ruin it

MAX
Kinda

RUSS
Smart move champ But you gotta
propose one day They want rings
Always want rings Even if they
say they don’t they do That’s
another life lesson right there
Whatever they say they don’t want
you to do they do Unless it’s
like I don’t want you to sleep with
your secretary then they really
don’t want you to sleep with your
secretary Ever

MAX
Right

RUSS
Youre a good kid you’re gonna go
far But start saving for that
ring you can only get so far
without a woman beside you
Seriously 3 months pay check

He gives Max a reassuring smile and pats him on the back
Evan returns to the table

EVAN
What are we talking about

MAX
Marriage

Evan bursts out laughing

EVAN
Yeah Max getting married That’1l
be the day

RUSS
Max is the marriage type I can
tell

Evan continues to laugh oblivious to the fact that Max
doesn’t find it humorous and has become lost in thought
Russ smiles at Max confident that he really is the marriage
type

INT MAXS HOUSE - OFFICE - EVENING

Max leans over his drafting board working on the Jenga
looking building Sophie walks in to the room wearing a
dress She leans over Max’s shoulder and looks at the
sketch

SOPHIE
Oo that’s looking great

MAX
Thanks

He sees she’s in a dress and looks her up and down

MAX (CONTD)
Where are you going

SOPHIE
Ugh Lucy set me up on a blind
date How do I look

MAX
Sexy

Max catches himself seeing that he just called her sexy and
that he’s staring at her in a way that makes it rather
obvious that he thinks she looks sexy

SOPHIE
Will you call me at 830 in case I
need to be rescued

MAX
Sure

SOPHIE
Thanks

MAX
Have fun

She gives him a look that says that’s very doubtful and then
heads out Max chuckles and turns back to his drawing

INT RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Sophie sits across from RYAN 35 - cute lawyery type

RYAN
Yeah I love Lucy She’s got a
great set of tits on her doesn’t
she

SOPHIE
Uhhhh

RYAN
I mean they’re like really supple
and mmm Just want to put your
face right in there and motor boat

youd have the same rack but I
guess it doesn’t run in the family

SOPHIE
Uh she just had a baby So you
know they’re from like the

milk

RYAN
Even better she can milk all over
me

Sophie’s jaw drops She glances down at her phone it’s only
802

RYAN (CONTD)
Oh wow I made you feel awkward I
was just joking around

SOPHIE
Yeah I’m sure

Sophie’s phone rings

SOPHIE (CONTD)
One second
She turns away from the table

SOPHIE (CONTD)

Hello

MAX (VO)
I’m lonely and couldn’t wait until
830

SOPHIE

Youre kidding Okay I’1l be
right there

She hangs up the phone and stands up

SOPHIE (CONT’D)
I’m sorry Ryan I have to go

RYAN
That was a fake call to see if you
need an excuse to leave wasn’t it

SOPHIE
Yep

She smiles and walks out of the restaurant

INT CANDY SHOP - LATER THAT NIGHT

Max is holding a bag of candy while Sophie adds more too it
It is a massive bag full of sour chewy candy

MAX
This is disgusting you know that
right We can’t eat this much
candy

SOPHIE
I can eat this much candy I’m
drowning my sorrows that all men
suck

MAX
Thanks

SOPHIE
Do you talk about your date’s
sister’s boobs on dates

MAX
Obviously that’s my best
conversation starter

Sophie leans her head on his shoulder and sighs

SOPHIE
Thanks for saving me And for
hanging out with me all the time
I know I’ve put a cramp in your
lifestyle

MAX
Not at all

SOPHIE
You haven’t been out with a girl or
gotten laid in like a month

MAX
I’m enjoying it Meaningless sex
is over rated

He smiles and nods to the register

MAX (CONTD)
I’ll go pay for this

When he’s done he turns around to see Sophie sitting on the

ground outside her head nestled in Bob’s neck giving him a
hug His eyes linger on her a smile creeping onto his face
and he walks outside to join her

INT MAX’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

Max and Sophie go about getting ready to leave the house
Max appears to be in somewhat of a hurry

SOPHIE
Here I’1l put your coffee ina
travel mug

MAX
Thanks Can you take Bob out

SOPHIE
Yep

Sophie hands Max his coffee mug as she walks him to the door

MAX
Thanks I’11 see you tonight

They absent mindedly kiss each other goodbye on the lips and
Max leaves As soon as Max shuts the door Sophie realizes
that was odd

SOPHIE
Huh

She shrugs and continues to eat her cereal
OUTSIDE
Max is stopped dead in the driveway trying to figure out what

possessed him to do that

INT MAXS OFFICE - DAY

Max and Jason go over some interior plans for the skyscraper
while eating Chinese food Max appears distracted

JASON
I know you’re going to say no to
this but just hear me out for a
second Slides

MAX
What’s a slide

JASON
Like the thing in playgrounds
Have them going from some of the
upper floors to the ground So
instead of taking the lift you
take the slide

MAX
Uhh No And it’s an elevator
not a lift We’re in America

JASON
Dammit I would kill for a slide
in this office

He notices Max appears distracted

JASON (CONTD)
What’s wrong with you

MAX
Sophie and I kissed as I was
running out the door today Like a
“goodbye see you later honey” kiss

JASON
Oh

MAX
It was like an involuntary response
on both of our parts

JASON
Maybe you should start doing some
soul searching and figure out if
youre in love with her and you
want her to make you lots of
babies

MAX
But I don’t think she’s think she
wants me to have her babies

JASON
Do you want to have her babies I
mean have her have your babies
That’s hard to say Because your
response was not refuting what I
was saying but saying that she
didn’t want to do that with you

Max shrugs he’s confused but kinda thinks he does want her
to have his babies

INT LUCY’S HOUSE - DAY

Sophie sits on Lucy’s floor holding the baby Addy while Lucy
looks over the fliers she had made to promote herself A
stack of envelopes sit on the table

SOPHIE
So What do you think

LUCY
They’re good You look hot

SOPHIE
I didn’t want to look hot That’s
why I’m not wearing any makeup

LUCY
Poor you you’re still hot without
make up I feel really sorry for
you
(Beat)
Who are you mailing them to

SOPHIE
Well everyone I know and you know
And maybe everyone Jack knows

LUCY
That’s a lot of researching of
addresses that sounds painfully

boring
SOPHIE

Aren’t you excited to help
LUCY

No
SOPHIE

Cmon I NEED to sell a house
because I haven’t been working with
any other agents and I don’t have
any money

LUCY
Isn’t that what your cuddle bitch
is for

SOPHIE
No

LUCY

Did you ever call that guy Jack
wanted to set you up with

SOPHIE
Yes He talked about how yummy
your lactating breasts were

LUCY
Ew That’s super creepy Yet a
bit flattering that my mommy boobs
are still attracting the gents

SOPHIE
I don’t want to be set up on
anymore dates

LUCY
You need to get out there Start
dating and hanging out with guys
other than Max

SOPHIE
But I’m happy right now And all
the shitty dates make me do is feel
bad about myself

LUCY
Aren’t you starting to get horny

SOPHIE
I have a vibrator

LUCY
That doesn’t replace a good solid
dick

Sophie rolls her eyes

LUCY (CONTD)
I’m just saying we’ve got libidos
too a girl’s gotta get laid And
there’s nothing worse then sharing
a wall with a guy that’s giving
girls the fuck of their life

SOPHIE
Life doesn’t revolve around sex
Luc

LUCY

Yeah it does That’s like our
primary function in life to have
sex Granted it’s meant to be for
baby manufacturing but the side
effect of pleasure is not too
shabby

Sophie sighs and leans back onto the couch Her sister is
clearly exhausting her

INT MAXS OFFICE - NIGHT

Max is slumped over his computer groaning as he tries to
resize the image of his Jenga building on the screen

EVAN
Jason’s got the night off we’re
going to dinner at the pub

Max looks up clearly incredibly frustrated

MAX
I’m kinda busy here

EVAN
Oh I’m sorry is your uterus
shedding it’s lining Boy time
let’s go

(MORE )

EVAN (CONTD)

We haven’t gone out in weeks cuz
youre all like work cuddle work
cuddle work snuggle And you’re
ready for the meeting

Max heaves a sigh

MAX
Fine

EVAN
There you go

MAX
Let me just call Sophie

Evan furrows his brow and stares at him
EVAN

Is that part of the whole cuddle
bitch stipulations Checking in

MAX
Don’t give me crap about that right
now

EVAN

Look it’s as simple as this If
your cock isn’t checking in with
her pussy you don’t have to check
in with her about a beer with the
guys

Max sighs and turns off his computer and grabs his jacket
Evan smiles triumphantly and escorts him out the door

INT PUB - NIGHT

Max Jason and Evan play pool and drink beer

MAX
Left corner pocket

EVAN
Jason seriously we think it’s a
really bad idea to go through with
marriage

MAX
We do

EVAN
Yes we talked We think she’s got
a grand scheme going to put a probe
up your ass extract sperm from
your testicles and castrated you so
she never has to have sex with you

JASON
That’s a really awful thought E

MAX

I don’t think that But if she did
that then you’d never have control
over how many babies you had You
could be like those people on TLC
with 17 kids and one in the oven
But I don’t really think that’s
what she’s trying to do

EVAN
Yes you do He does Jason Get
out before it’s too late Once
youre married she owns half of
everything that means she owns one
of your balls She could win one
in the divorce and force you to go
under a testectomy I’m looking
out for the well being of your
reproductive system here

JASON
She couldn’t really sue me for my
balls could she

Evan shrugs trying hard to convince him Jason looks to Max
who just smiles and shakes his head Jason breaths a sigh of
relief

JASON (CONTD)
You’re a bad friend Evan

MAX
Or he’s a really good friend and he
just misses you that much

EVAN
Whatever happened to “Bros before
Hoes”

MAX

We graduated from third grade

Max hands Jason his pool stick

MAX (CONTD)
I gotta head home and go to bed

JASON
It’s 800 I still have a half
hour

MAX

I wanna go over my notes for the
meeting tomorrow

JASON
EVAN
Well miss you

MAX
I’‘1l miss you too

Max gives them each a man hug and leaves

INT MAX’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Max comes home to find Sophie sitting on the living room
floor playing with Addy

MAX
Hey

SOPHIE
Hi

He watches her play with the baby for a few moments a smile
creeping on his face as Addy giggles when Sophie plays
airplane with her She’s a natural with the baby and he
can’t take his eyes off of her

MAX
Hi there Addy

SOPHIE
Where were you so late I made
meatballs and you missed them

He takes Addy from Sophie’s arms and coos at her The baby
giggles as he makes funny faces

MAX
I went out with E and Jason The
meeting with Waterford is tomorrow

Sophie can tell that he’s exhausted and nervous

SOPHIE
Don’t stress about it You’re
going to do great

Max shrugs he’s not so confident

MAX
What’d you do today

SOPHIE
I mailed a shit ton of fliers to
everyone I know And I have a pile
for you to send to everyone you
know

She grins at him and he puts his arm around her

MAX
Youre a pain in the ass

SOPHIE
Thanks You love me

MAX
I know

He leans his head against her and watches Addy crawl ontop of
Bob

INT MAXS OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM —- DAY

Max stands in front of a group of Asian CEOs Behind him is
a mock up of the skyscraper

MAX
I understand that you want a cost
efficient building able to hold as
many people as possible But what
I aim for as a contemporary
architect is to give you an office
space that people love I want
your employees to love coming to
work every day I want them to be
inspired by their surroundings To
feel at home there I want them to
be happier and more productive
employees because of the building
you give them After all many of
us spend 70 of our day at our
offices

The CEOs flip through the production books with all of the
specifications The head CEO CHIN shakes his head

CHIN
This isn’t right

He looks through it a few more times before looking back up
Max who is now shifting nervously from foot to foot trying
to figure out what’s not right

CHIN (CONT’D)
You budgeted for material and
production here in US not in
Shanghai

Max looks confused

CHIN (CONTD)
Production and materials cost more
in China

MAX
I know but the dollar is--

CHIN
The dollar is awful US is in
recession But aside from that
production costs are higher in
Shanghai for some materials lower
for other It’s not a direct
conversion for dollar to Renminbi
And you don’t have earthquake
factored in here The levels jut
out 10 feet it need to be more
around 5 feet

Max gapes his shoulders sink down Chin shakes his head and
stands up

MAX
No no wait I can fix the levels
and the earthquake and that’1l
knock money off of the budget plan
And I can totally redo the budget
explanations I had extra money in
the budget so I upgraded certain
amenities like the--

CHIN
We like the building but too big of
oversight We have to talk to Russ
and Walter about it

MAX
Well I’m going to go ahead and fix
the budget in hopes that you’1l
understand the miscalculations
(MORE)

MAX (CONTD)
I really want to work with you guys
on this and I love the project

Chin nods his head and leaves followed by the other men

Once they’re out of view Max sits down and hits himself in
the head a few times before pulling out his phone

INTERCUT AS NEEDED WITH

EXT STREET -DAY

Sophie holds her phone in one hand and Bob’s leash in the
other He’s pretty much walking Sophie

SOPHIE
Howd it go

MAX
Shitty Really fucking shitty I
may have just lost it Which means
I may have just gotten myself and
90 other people fired

SOPHIE
I’m sure you didn’t lose it It’s
going to be fine I’m sure But
I’m really sorry it didn’t go as
well as youd hope

MAX
It didn’t go well at all

SOPHIE
Well on the positive side you’re
going to love the stress relieving
weekend I have planned for you
We’re going to Tahoe Lucy lent me
her cabin

MAX
I can’t--

SOPHIE

Bob no No Bad boy I gotta
go he’s humping the mailman

END INTERCUT

She hangs up the phone and tries to pry Bob off of the poor
MATLMAN

SOPHIE
I am so so so sorry He does that
sometimes

MATLMAN
You need get him neutered

SOPHIE
His dad doesn’t want to him to lose
his manhood He’s oddly protective
of his dog

MATLMAN
It’s socially irresponsible to let
a sexually charged fertile dog run
around humping things

He glares at her and then walks away
SOPHIE
Bob he’s right One day we may
have to do the inevitable They
are rather unsightly
She glances over at his huge balls flopping between his legs

as he walks

INT MAXS OFFICE - LATER

Max is working furiously on his computer when Russ comes in

RUSS
My office now

Max stands up and reluctantly trudges after him knowing this
isn’t good

He walks into

RUSS’S OFFICE

And Russ shuts the door behind him Walter is fuming behind
him

RUSS
Let me get this straight When we
told you this project meant keeping
us above water in a recession you
decided it’d be a swell idea to
blow the project by not taking into
account foreign production costs
Russ nods for Max to leave the office

his head

MAX
I’m sorry I can fix it

RUSS
Really can you Because I just
got off the phone with Chin at
Waterford and they’re starting to
look elsewhere while I try to
convince them to give you another
shot

WALTER
And Earthquake stability Are you
serious He said the platforms
jutted out 10 feet too far Who
was your structural engineer on
this And why weren’t you thinking
of all of this anyway

MAX
Evan and I’m sorry I’m going to
fix it I promise He didn’t say
they were too far out and he must
not have gone over the final--

WALTER
That’s the least of the problems
now but you better have this fixed
by next week and get them to buy it
or youre fired

RUSS
And we’re not joking this time
Max This is not a fucking joke
We thought you were serious about
your career and then you go fucking
shit up left and right And easy
shit

MAX
Okay I will It’1l all be fixed
I promise We’re not going to lose
them

EXT CAFE - NIGHT

Max Jason and Evan eat burgers and drink beer

He walks out hanging

EVAN
I did tell you that I said
specifically 5 feet You weren’t
listening your were too busy
playing virtual footsy with Sophie
And don’t you dare tell them this
is my fault because I TOLD you
that If I get fired--

MAX
Why didn’t you double check the
last proposal image

EVAN
I shouldn’t have to hold your dick
while you pee

MAX
This is a huge fucking project and
you let a giant fucking error slide
right past you You never
mentioned anything about
earthquakes

EVAN
Dude you’re an architect I
thought you heard of the impact
earthquakes have on structures I
told you what the specifications
needed to be that’s my job Your
job is to follow them I didn’t do
anything wrong And the bigger
fucking issue with all of this is
the fact that you did the budget
wrong So don’t blame any of this
shit on me

MAX
Fine

They all sit in silence for a few moments Jason looks
uncomfortable and Max and Evan look like they hate each

JASON
So what’d you decide about Sophie
Max

Evan’s head snaps over towards Max

EVAN
What does he mean

JASON
They kissed goodbye accidentally

EVAN
I hope when you say kissed you’re
talking about your genitals
kissing

MAX
No that’s not what he means And
you guys were right I do want to
have sex with her

Evan smacks his hands together in excitement clearly no
longer mad at Max

EVAN
I knew it So when you gonna make
the move

MAX
I’m not going to make a move
because I think that I want her to
be my girlfriend

JASON
Really

Jason looks pleased to hear this news Evan not so much

EVAN
Whoa whoa whoa Don’t just go
throwing around the word girlfriend
haphazardly You have sex Max
it’s part of who you are You are
a player You don’t want
girlfriends that means the end of
your awesomeness as an awesome
player I’ve already lost him to
the pussy I refuse to let you go

Max is growing increasingly irritated with Evan

MAX
I’m in love with her

EVAN
See here’s what has happened
Youve denied your penis delightful
pussy that’s living right under his
head

(MORE)

EVAN (CONTD)

And now finally your penis is so
tired of your brain convincing him
that he doesn’t want to spit inside
of her that he’s gone and convinced
your brain that you’re in love with
her in order to justify you wanting
to have sex with her

Max and Jason look at each other confused as to what exactly
he just said

EVAN (CONT’D)
It’s a simple case of over-
horniness boys Easy fix

Max turns to Jason

MAX
What’s the best part of being ina
relationship

JASON
Um you guys aren’t gonna make fun
of me for my answer are you

EVAN
Probably

Max glares at Evan as if telling him to grow way the hell
up

MAX
No we won’t

JASON
It’s like the fact that I can be
really excited about something good
happening to me and she’s even more
excited than I am You know And
you guys make fun of me for being
pussy whipped but she loves me so
much she wants to be with me all
the time and I want to be with her
all the time but I pretend I don’t
so you guys don’t make fun of me
because I know you both hate love
Well Max previously hated love
Evan still does

MAX
See I want that with her I like
coming home to someone and telling
her about my day

(MORE )

MAX (CONTD)
She makes me really happy and I
want all that like what you have
with Brooke

Evan slams his hamburger onto his plate

EVAN
Fuck me

He gets up from the table and walks away Jason pats Max on
the back as if telling him it’s going to be okay

INT MAX’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Max walks in the door and is met by Bob leaping towards him

MAX
Bob no

Bob is about to jump on him but he meets Max’s knee in his
chest and crumples to the floor He looks up at Max with a
sad dejected look on his face

Max goes into the kitchen where Sophie is dressed in a full
on snow suit

SOPHIE
What do you think

MAX
I think you must be two seconds
away from overheating

SOPHIE
I am
MAX
I can’t go to Tahoe this weekend
Soph
Sophie’s face falls
SOPHIE
Why
MAX

I have so much work to do I have
to redo the whole budget fix
earthquake specs but first I have
to get them to agree to actually
giving me a second chance

SOPHIE
Yeah but you’re going to be way
more refreshed to do that if you
get away for the weekend Please
I can tell you want to go

MAX
I do but I have so much to do and--

SOPHIE
No buts You’ve been working your
ass off and you need some time off
It’s 2 days You probably won’t
work much over the weekend anyway
because you’re at home and I’m
quite distracting See if Jason
and Brooke want to come maybe
Please We really need it

Max sighs she can tell he’s giving in She grins and gives
him a hug

INT TAHOE CABIN - NIGHT

Max and Sophie walk into a cute winter cabin followed by
Jason and BROOKE 28 - pretty and sassy

JASON
Oh wow this is great

SOPHIE
Bedroom on the left is yours

Jason nods thanks and carries his and Brooke’s luggage into
the bedroom Brooke on his heals

BROOKE
Don’t drag it you’re going to
scratch their floors

JASON
I wasn’t dragging it It was
hovering over the ground

BROOKE
It wasn’t hovering hovering is
silent There was a noise being
made and that noise was the noise
of dragging

Sophie and Max look at each other and stifle laughs They go
into the

MASTER BEDROOM

The bedroom is large and rustically romantic There is a
large four poster king size bed and a small chase lounge

SOPHIE
They are too funny you know Why
don’t we hang out with them more

MAX
Because we only hang out with each
other

SOPHIE

We should start hanging out with
them more because I kind of love
her I need more girl friends

MAX
Yeah Are you gonna shower before
we eat

SOPHIE
Yep

MAX

K well hurry up I’m starving

SOPHIE
K

Sophie goes into the adjoining bathroom shutting the door
behind her but it pops back open a sliver

Max goes about unpacking his suitcase He turns to put some
clothes into the dresser and through the sliver in the door
he spots Sophie in the shower her naked back to him He
stops and stares for a few moments mesmerized

INT RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Max Sophie Jason and Brooke sit in a cozy booth drinking
wine eating and talking Max watches Brooke and Jason
clearly completely in love with a hint of envy

BROOKE
Stop steeling my fries I asked if
you wanted any fries because it
makes your skin oily and now you’re
eating my fries

JASON
I didn’t think they were going to
look this tasty

BROOKE
Well they do so I want to eat them
Hands off

She swats his hand away from her plate but he continues to
try and steal them making her giggle

MAX

I want someone to steal my fries
SOPHIE

What
MAX

Someone to steal my fries
He nods at Brooke and Jason
SOPHIE
Are you not hungry Or do you not
like the fries
MAX
No I like my fries I just
thought they were kind of cute

Max shrugs embarrassed to have said that outloud Sophie
smiles and lets her eyes linger on him for a few moments

INT BAR - LATER THAT NIGHT

Sophie and Max take a shot at the bar Pat Benetar’s “Hit Me
With Your Best Shot” comes on and Sophie jumps up excitedly

SOPHIE
Cmon

She drags Max onto what she considers to be a dance floor but
it’s really just a small open area where no one else is
dancing She starts shamelessly dancing and singing along to
the song He laughs and watches her with a stupid smile
plastered on his face for a few moments before she drags him
by the collar of his shirt to join her He tries to refuse
but quickly gives up and starts dancing just as shamelessly
as she is

INT TAHOE CABIN - LATER

Sophie and Max crawl into bed both pretty drunk Sophie
curls up with her back against Max’s stomach He closes his
eyes

SOPHIE
Hey Max

MAX
Yeah

Sophie turns over and sticks her index finger out

SOPHIE
Oouuchhhhh

They both erupt into giggles laughing until it turns into
sighs Sophie closes her eyes but Max lays there staring at
her in a way he doesn’t usually stare at her He pushes the
hair away from her face and watches her for a few more
moments unaware that a smile has appeared on his face He
sighs and closes his eyes

EXT SKI SLOPES - DAY

Sophie and Max tear down the mountain Max on skis Sophie on
a snowboard racing each other Max reaches the bottom of
the mountain and waits for Sophie who stops right in front of
him sending a huge wave of snow all over him

SOPHIE
You waxed your skis last night you
had an advantage so it’s not fair

MAX
I really wish you’d just go back to
skiing It’s so much more
civilized

SOPHIE
Snowboarding is civilized

MAX
No it’s not You should switch
back now because you never see
mothers snowboarding It’s like
how you never see mothers
skateboarding Because it’s for
punks

SOPHIE
Youre lame

MAX

Youre lame

SOPHIE

You wanna head into the lodge
Brooke and Jason are probably
already there

K

MAX

INT LODGE - CONTINUOUS

Sophie and Max walk
sitting in front of
CARTER WILSON 33 -

Brooke spots Sophie

into the lodge and see Jason and Brooke
the fire drinking wine and talking to
devilishly handsome cool and relaxed
and jumps up

BROOKE

Soph I want you to meet Carter

Wilson
lift

We met him on the chair

Carter stands up and shakes her hand She clearly finds him

attractive letting
than necessary

her hand linger for a few more moments

CARTER

Nice to meet you

You too

And this

SOPHIE

BROOKE
is her friend Max

Carter and Max shake hands

MAX

Nice to meet you

You too

CARTER

MAX

I’m gonna go get a drink you want

anything

Soph

SOPHIE

Sure just get me something I like

Max and Jason walk

over to the bar
BROOKE
Carter is looking to buy a place in
the Peninsula area

SOPHIE
Really

CARTER
And I hear you’re an agent so
Brooke thought maybe you could help
me find a place

Sophie is slightly taken aback

SOPHIE
Oh yeah definitely

Max and Jason have drifted over to the bar where Max is
watching Sophie and Carter chat

MAX
Who is that

JASON
Brooke and I made friends on the
lift with a billionaire energy
trader who happens to be looking to
buy a place in Los Altos He’s
here alone so we’ve been skiing
with him all afternoon

MAX
Who meets someone on a chair lift
and then decides to tag along with
them all day

JASON
He drives a Maserati

Jason gives a giddy grin

JASON (CONTD)
We could be speeding around on the
weekends in a Maserati with Carter
in a few months

MAX
He was just bragging about having a
Maserati

JASON
No I asked if he had one

MAX
Classy Jason He looks like an
asshole

JASON

No he’s totally awesome Like I
want him to be my best friend

MAX
Dude

JASON
Sorry no offence to you I want
him for an additional BFF You
should too he’s so cool

MAX
So I tell you I think I’m in love
with Sophie and we go on a couples
skiing weekend and you introduced
her to a hot sexy billionaire
looking to buy a house Thanks

JASON
Well I thought you’d told me she
was having trouble getting someone
to enlist her as their agent

MAX
She is but I was kinda hoping for
an old man client for her when I’m
trying to get her attention

JASON
I didn’t think of it that way
Maybe he’s not single

MAX
Don’t you think you would’ve heard
about that when you were prancing
around on the mountain with him

JASON
I suppose

Max grows irritated as he watches Sophie throw her head back
laughing as she talks to Carter

MAX
He could be a serial killer

JASON
He is not Ooo we should google
him and see how much money he has

MAX
No you know what I’m happy for
her she needed a client and
hopefully she’ll get him She
wouldn’t hook up with a client
anyway

Max smiles as nods his head as if he’s trying to reassure
himself and takes a long sip from his drink He watches as
Sophie and Carter walk out of the lodge

MAX (CONTD)
Oh awesome they’re probably on
their way to the wedding chapel
now

EXT CARTER’S CONDO - LATER

A luxurious modern mountain-chic building on the side of
the mountain just a short ski away from the ski lift Sophie
follows Carter inside

INT CARTER’S CONDO - CONTINUOUS

Carter opens the door for Sophie letting her into his condo
It’s huge and tastefully decorated with subtly chic furniture
and art The kitchen opens into a living room that sports a
massive fireplace

SOPHIE
Wow this is gorgeous
(Beat)
So do you think you want to go
modern again For the house in the
bay area

Carter shrugs

CARTER
I’m really not that particular
about the style I really just
liked this place because of the ski
in ski out

SOPHIE
Yeah the location isn’t too
shabby Nor is that fireplace If
this was my house I think my bed
would be right next to that
fireplace

Carter laughs and nods for her to follow him They walk down
the hall and into the massive master bedroom where a large
king size bed is positioned directly next to another huge
fireplace

CARTER
That’s pretty much the other reason
I bought this place So that’s
like the one thing I do want in my
house huge fireplaces You think
you can find something in my price
range with fireplaces

SOPHIE
What’s your price range

CARTER
Like 2-8 million

SOPHIE
What do you do again

CARTER
I was an energy trader Made a lot
of money and then quit because it
was sucking the life out of me

SOPHIE
Okay I have to be honest I’ve
been in real estate for 6 years
but I’ve never really sold
anything I mostly work with other
agents People tend to be put off
by my age You’re looking to spend
a lot of money so I just want to be
honest about that

Carter shrugs it doesn’t seem to phase him a bit

CARTER
Just because someone is 50 doesn’t
mean they know jack shit At least
you spent time getting to know the
industry and working with out
people Everyone has to sell their
first house

Sophie is a bit astonished

SOPHIE
You really don’t care

CARTER
No In fact I’m really impressed
that you told me I’ve had a lot
of real estate agents in my time
and most of them lie and try to get
me the most expensive place so they
can get a higher commission

SOPHIE
Well to be honest I’d be happy
with the commission from a 600000
condo But I’d prefer the
3000000 probably
Carter laughs

CARTER
So do we have a deal

SOPHIE
Yep

They smile and shake hands

INT TAHOE CABIN - MAX’S ROOM - NIGHT

Max stands in the bathroom staring at himself in the mirror
He spots a red spot on his face and moves in to inspect it
more closely He wrinkles his nose tries to pop it but
makes it worse instead

He looks down and sees Sophie’s makeup bag and searches
through it until he finds some concealer He taps a tiny bit
on the red spot which effectively makes it disappear He
nods at himself in the mirror

MAX
That’s kinda cool

He checks out the concealer bottle before putting it back
The bedroom door opens and Sophie comes in

SOPHIE
Max

He turns around and leans his head out of the bathroom

MAX
Hey

SOPHIE
Guess what

Sophie bursts into the bathroom and perches herself on the

sink in front of him

MAX
You got married

SOPHIE
Better I’m going to sell that guy
a house A very expensive house
Are you wearing cover up

Max blushes

MAX
No

SOPHIE
I can see it

MAX
I had a zit

SOPHIE
You woman

MAX

Why is it not socially acceptable
for a man to make his blemish
unnoticeable

Sophie considers this he’s got a point
SOPHIE

Well let’s at least try and blend
it

She picks up a brush from her makeup back and some bronzer

and lightly runs it over Max’s face

MAX
That’s great by the way About the
millionaire douche

SOPHIE
Billionaire actually He was like
an energy trader or something I
dont even know what that is but he
made a shit ton of money and now he
wants to give it to me And you
know he’s like ridiculously hot
and funny so working with him is
actually going to be really fun I
think

MAX
That’s great do you love him

Sophie laughs pausing from doing Max’s makeup

SOPHIE
What

MAX
It just sounds like you have a
thing for him and that just sounds
like a bad idea if you ask me
Mixing business with pleasure

SOPHIE
Yeah but I’m not you so I don’t
do those types of things

MAX
I bet he has a lot of emotional
issues Anda tiny dick Or he’s
a premature ejaculator

SOPHIE
Whoa do rich successful handsome
men threaten you

MAX
He seems like a prick

SOPHIE
Sounds like they do Don’t worry
youre still my cuddle bitch
Youre not easily replaceable

MAX
So that’s all I’m good for
Cuddling

SOPHIE
That and giving me a good laugh
when I have to do your makeup for

you
MAX
We’re never talking about this
again
SOPHIE
Uh huh

She does the finally touches and puts the makeup away Max
turns to the mirror and checks himself out

MAX
I have like a healthy after-sex
glow

SOPHIE

Exactly what I was going for
Another reason why your safe from
replacement We think alike Now
get out because I want to take a
bath

MAX

K

(Beat)
Soph I’m happy for you about
getting a client If all goes well
with him hopefully he’1ll recommend
you to his billionaire friends
And then you can buy me a house in
the mountains and support me in my
old age

SOPHIE
Exactly my plan Now out

Max gives himself a once over and heads out

MAX
You want to me to wait or do you
want to just meet us at the bar

SOPHIE
No I’m actually gonna have dinner
with Carter and go over some areas
I think he’d like to look at

MAX
Oh

He shuts the bathroom door And leans against it a dejected
look on his face

INT BAR - NIGHT

Max Jason and Brooke sit in a booth The guys drink beer
and Brooke sips on a glass of wine She’s visibly a bit
tipsy

MAX
Maybe I should just tell her how I
feel
JASON
Uh I’m not so sure about that

He looks to Brooke

BROOKE
I don’t know Sophie so well but
what I gather is that she still
sees you as this man child that
lives for the player lifestyle

MAX
I’ve been playing husband for
months now I’ve had sex like 4
times

BROOKE
That’s 4 more times than I’ve had
sex in the past few months

MAX
Yeah but you created that rule

BROOKE
He created that rule not me

Max looks at Jason who stares off sheepishly

BROOKE (CONTD)
He wants us to be born again
virgins He told you I made him do
it didn’t he

MAX
Yeah

BROOKE
Stop making me look like a heinous
bitch to your friends because
youre too embarrassed that you’re
all sentimental and romantic and
traditional

MAX
Well in his defence Evan would’ve
crucified it

JASON
I had to say something I’m going
crazy without sex

BROOKE
Then let’s have sex

JASON
No I want it to be special on our
wedding night

BROOKE
Do you see what I have to deal
with Now back to your problem
Just try and get her to see that
what you want in your future isn’t
ho bags and Costco sized boxes of
condoms

JASON
Make her see what you want is a
family and a home not a just a
career and a fuck pad

MAX
You guys make me sound like such an
ass

Max sinks lower into his chair and chugs on his beer

EXT MAXS HOUSE - NIGHT

Max and Sophie wave goodbye as Brooke and Jason pull out of
their driveway

SOPHIE
That was just about the best trip
of my life
MAX
Because of Money Bags McGee
SOPHIE
Stop it
MAX

What You convinced me that I
needed a weekend away when I told
you I had to work and then you
ditched me for him I’m allowed to
be annoyed

SOPHIE
You always ditch me for other girls
when we’re out

MAX
I do not When was the last time
that happened

SOPHIE
I don’t know But it was purely
professional we were talking
business And I didn’t force you
to come I thought it’d be good
for you to get away from work

MAX
Yes god there is nothing I love
more than going to Tahoe and
getting ditched at every moment
possible while my “cuddle bitch”
talks “business” on the ski lifts
and the slopes and in front of
fireplaces

SOPHIE
Whoa jealous much

MAX
So what

SOPHIE
Aw that’s kinda cute

MAX
He’s an asshole

SOPHIE
He’s probably gonna have to come by
sometimes so if you could refrain
from trying to work out your
insecurities on him that’d be
awesome

MAX
Isn’t that a bit unprofessional to
bring him by your house And by
your house I mean my house

SOPHIE
Seriously Max Stop whatever all
this is It’s annoying

MAX
He does not make me feel insecure
I just think he’s sleazy

SOPHIE
He’s about ten times classier than
you are

Max glares at her offended and hurt

MAX
There’s a difference between acting
a bit jealous after being ditched
over and over again and being a
flat out bitch

He stomps into the house and slams the door Sophie sighs
and rolls her eyes

INT MAX’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Sophie appears in Max’s room as he stomps around

SOPHIE
I’m sorry I didn’t mean to hurt
your feelings

MAX

going to continue to pick a fight
with me

MAX
Maybe

SOPHIE
That’s mature

MAX
There you go again Max is a
douche Max is a sleaze Max is an
immature asshole with STDs I get
it you think I suck

SOPHIE
Whoa I did not say any of that

MAX
But that’s what you think And you
know what I’m not all shitty I
have feelings and emotions and I’m
not as big of an asshole as you
think And I blew off my job for
you Sophie I needed to work this
weekend but I didn’t because I
wanted to be with you I wanted to
be there with you Don’t you get
it

SOPHIE
Here’s an idea why don’t you think
of someone other than yourself for
once I need a client Max I need
to sell a house

Max stares at Sophie vulnerable and upset He turns on his
heels and goes into the bathroom slamming the door behind

him

Sophie stomps into her room and slams her own door

A few moments later she comes back out and opens Max’s door

again

SOPHIE (CONTD)
You know what I don’t get it
What do you want me to do Not
work with this guy because he makes
you insecure

MAX
No it’s not that I wanted to
spend the weekend with you You
and me Together And I was
hoping that maybe if we went away
youd for some reason realize that
I’m not the shitty slutty person
you for some reason can’t get over

(MORE )

MAX (CONTD)
And that I want the same things in
life as you do I want to have a
family I want to get married I
want to grow old with someone next
to me

Sophie gapes at him

SOPHIE
You like like me

Max shrugs embarrassed that he just said all that

SOPHIE (CONTD)
You do not You’re just into the
idea that I’m your best friend and
you can’t have me

Maxs face falls

MAX
Thanks Sophie You think I’m
incapable of emotions Thanks a
lot Now get out of my room

other best friend and don’t invite
me So while you’re there I’m
here trying to save your ass

start crying any second Evan sees this

EVAN (CONT’D)

have to cry

MAX
No it’s just I’m fucking all of
this up And Sophie’s mad at me

liked her and she threw it in my
face And this project it’s a
lot of pressure

So who’d you fuck last night

MAX

with an answer

SOPHIE
Why ashamed

MAX
No because you won’t even give me a
chance to be someone else so I’m
just gonna go on and continue to
let you think whatever you want to
think about me

JACK
I honestly cannot believe you did

coated in caramel

SOPHIE
Do they make those

LUCY
No I think youre actually gonna
have to make that for me And
sprinkle some marshmallow pieces on
that

SOPHIE
He kicked me out Luc

LUCY
I told you this was going to end
badly You can’t snuggle with a
guy and expect him not to want to
have sex with you and then when he
does have sex with you expect him
to not want to do it again

SOPHIE
It’s not about the sex it’s about
the fact that he thinks sex
cuddle bitching love

LUCY
It does To normal people since
normal people don’t have cuddle
bitches Because that’s weird We
like to spoon and cop a feel while
we do that Us normal people that
is And Sophie you know you love
him

SOPHIE
He’s never been in a relationship
in his life Lucy and never even had
the desire and all of the sudden
after living with me for a couple
of months he’s in love with me

She pats Sophie on the back and gets up

LUCY
Yeah that seems like exactly what
would happen to a guy when he’s put
in a situation that mimics
marriage He changes

SOPHIE
Max doesn’t change

LUCY
I think you’re a little harsh on
him He’s a good guy We all love
Max You’re the only one focused
on his tiny flaws

SOPHIE
It’s a huge flaw

LUCY

And you focus on it because you
love him and you don’t want to
admit it because you’re scared
he’ll leave you Take a few days
and think about it You’re an
amazing person too and you deserve
to be happy I want you to be
happy and I think he makes you

happy

GIRL (CONTD)
Is that not cool

MAX
I’m looking for a relationship

GIRL
In a bathroom stall

MAX
I donno God don’t judge me for
wanting to get married

He backs out of the stall and dashes back into the bar area
to Evan and Jason

MAX (CONTD)
That panty-less chick was married

EVAN
And you left her in there horny
and wet
Max nods
EVAN (CONT’D)
Can I go tap that
Max nods

EVAN (CONTD)
Fuck yeah E is getting laid

He heads towards the bathroom Max slings his arm around
Jason

MAX
Let’s do more shots

Jason nods in agreement
JASON
You’re gonna be okay pal you know
that right
Max shrugs
A moment later Evan returns
EVAN
She already found someone else to
replace you I was not allowed to
join

He picks up one of the shots and takes it with the other two
guys

UNDER MUSIC

-MAX’S Max lays on the couch trying to get comfortable
while watching The Bachelor He takes a pillow and hugs it
then tries putting it behind him He coaxes Bob up onto the
couch and tries to spoon him but Bob takes up the whole
couch He sighs and sits up He stares at the TV depressed
and clearly lonely

-LUCY’S Sophie brings out a Scrabble board and tries to get
Lucy and Jack to play with her They both shake their heads

LUCY
I hate scrabble it’s pointless

Sophie’s face falls
-MAXS Max lays in bed reading the scrabble dictionary

-LUCY’S Sophie lays on the couch with her feet on Lucy who
is clearly annoyed with this

LUCY (CONTD)
I get that you’re trying to
compensate for your lack of a
cuddle bitch but I’m pregnant and
if anyone’s feet are going to be on
anyone it’s going to be mine on
you

-MAX’S Max goes into the kitchen in the morning and looks
at the coffee pot and toaster He decides against any
breakfast at all and leaves for work

END MUSIC

INT MAXS OFFICE - DAY

Max sits at his desk with a sullen look on plastered on his
face Walter comes in

WALTER
Why are you so depressed all of the
sudden You’re making me
depressed If you can’t get laid
there’s no hope for the rest of us

MAX
Oh well
WALTER
Well get up cuz Russ and I want to
see you in his office

INT RUSS’S OFFICE - A LITTLE LATER

Max stares at Russ and Walter at a loss for words

MAX
Youre shitting me right

WALTER
We thought they were shitting us at
first too But they assured us
they’re not

RUSS
Apparently they have way more
confidence in you than we do and
think that since you were
distracted by some girl--

MAX
Who told you that

WALTER
Evan and Jason

RUSS
And that they were oversights that
could have happened to many idiots
out there And since you already
made them once they think you won’t
make them again And they love
your visions

MAX
So what exactly does this mean

WALTER
It means that you’re designing the
new hotel in Dubai And may we
suggest when you’re there you
don’t fornicate on the beach

RUSS
Apparently they’re not that big on
PDA or PDF - public displays of
fucking

MAX
Holy crap You’re serious

WALTER
No this time we’re actually not
Were firing you

They stare at him completely serious for a good five
seconds enough to make Max nearly start crying And then
they break into laughs

WALTER (CONT’D)
We’re making you partner Yay

A giant grin breaks on Max’s face

INT MAXS OFFICE - A LITTLE LATER

Max walks back into his office and sits down at his desk
still in shock He instinctively picks up his cell phone and
goes to dial Sophie but stops He groans and sinks into his
chair

EXT HOUSE - DAY

Sophie hands Carter the keys to his new house and takes the
IN ESCROW sign down and tosses it in her car

CARTER
I gave your name to a friend of
mine that is thinking about getting
a summer house out here

SOPHIE
You did
CARTER
Yep
SOPHIE
Thanks Carter I hope you’ll keep
in touch
CARTER

Yeah I was actually going to see
if you were interested in going to
dinner Like a date dinner

SOPHIE
I don’t think so not right now
I’m just going through some stuff
and have a lot going on I’m
sorry

CARTER
It’s okay I understand Call me
if you change your mind

SOPHIE
Thanks

They hug goodbye and Sophie gets in her car An alarm goes
of on her phone and she picks it up The alarm reads Garth
Brooks Concert 8pm She stares at it a few moments before
putting it down and starting her car

INT CONCERT - NIGHT

Sophie makes her way through the crowd to her row When she
finds it she looks hopefully down it hoping to spot Max
Her two seats are empty She sighs and makes her way to her
seat

A few moments later the lights dim and Garth Brooks takes
the stage and starts his first song

She tries to bop along to the music but she just starts
crying As she’s wiping a tear away from her face a finger
comes into view and touches her cheek

MAX (0C)
(As ET)
Ouchhh

Sophie jumps and turns to see Max standing next to her a big
smile on his face She wraps her arms around him

MAX (CONTD)
I got partner And a contract for
a hotel in Dubai

SOPHIE
I sold a house

They stand in awkward silence for a few moments Finally
Sophie breaks down and kisses him She pulls back and looks
him in the eyes

SOPHIE (CONTD)
I love you too

Max smiles and kisses her again

SOPHIE (CONTD)
I missed my cuddle bitch

MAX
You mean you missed being my cuddle
bitch

They grin at each other and kiss again When they pull
apart Max wraps his arms around her and they turn to watch
the concert

Fade to Black

THE END
