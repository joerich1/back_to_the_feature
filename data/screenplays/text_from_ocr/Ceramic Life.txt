CBS NEWS SPECIAL REPORT INSIDE POP THE ROCK REVOLUTION 1967

LEONARD BERNSTEIN
For a long time now Ive been
fascinated by the strange and
compelling scene called Pop Music
I say strange because its unlike
any scene I can think of in the
history of all music I say
compelling because it shows no sign
of abatement The fads change the
groups change but the songs keep
coming Increasingly odd defiant
and free This music raises lots
of questions But right now for
openers here are the two that
concern me most one why do adults
recent it so And two why do I

OF THE LIMOUSINE

Lina continues to run with fear She reaches the edge of a
steep cliff and stops She looks back once again

chasing her reaches out to touch her shoulder She throws
herself off of the cliff Her body hits the bottom and
breaks into a million ceramic pieces

In slow-mo we follow one of those pieces as it flies through
the air The piece falls back to the ground At a closer

look we can see the ceramic piece is one of her eyes We look
deep into that ceramic eye and into its black pupil as we

INT LINAS BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Both nervously breathing with passion Robbie carries her to
the bed She falls on the bed like she has fallen on clouds
She tries to take off his pants He pulls her hands away
from his belt gently throws her back pins her arms down on
the bed and starts to kiss her neck and breasts He kisses
her strong stomach and legs She takes deep breaths with
every kiss He softly opens her legs and kisses her inner
thighs Her breathing has now become soft moans Her eyes
roll back in her head as he finally starts to pleasure her
Her moans are now loud whimpers

The clock radio reads 1212am Only after a few minutes she
climaxes The clock radio reads 1217 She climaxes again
The clock radio reads 1231 She climaxes yet again

He kisses her stomach as he gently climbs on top of her His
clothes are completely off as he presses his hard body
against hers As he penetrates her eyes want to burst out
of their sockets She lets out a loud scream

As he strokes her in a slow soft pace she passionately
