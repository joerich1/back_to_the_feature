OPEN IN

A NEW YORK APARTMENT
Spacious Modernist furniture Some black lacquer

A man’s voice is heard From his tone we can tell he’s
used to people listening when he speaks

BEN (VO)
The day I turned thirteen

TRACK into

THE BEDROOM
BEN KALMAN sleeps

BEN (VO)
--Actually it was the night I
turned thirteen after the party
and the envelopes and speeches and
all that

An alarm buzzes Ben slowly sits up It is a rare
unguarded moment He doesnt let anyone see him like
this untucked groggy wearing all of his 55-plus years
on his face It takes him a long moment to reach for his
bathrobe and put it on

BEN (VO)
My father came into my bedroom
put a hand on my shoulder and
said “Ben a lot of guys are
gonna tell you a lot of shit But
what I’m gonna tell you applies
across the board Business
personal whatever what-have-
you

He reaches into a bottle of children’s aspirin swallows
one without water and moves to the

BATHROOM

Ben checks himself in the mirror Pulls his robe tight
Slicks his hair with his hands

BEN (VO)
“Son” he said “fuck ‘em where
you find ‘em and leave ‘em where
you fuck ‘em”

(CONTTNURFD )

Ben clears his eyes splashes water on his face

BEN (VO)
He was either a hundred per cent
right or a hundred per cent wrong
I’m still not sure which

Ben takes one more look at himself in the mirror and
leaves the bathroom as Johnny Cash’s version of Solitary
Man begins to play

CUT TO

CITY STREETS

CREDITS roll and the song continues as Ben moves through
the Upper East Side streets of Manhattan

This is Ben as the world sees him almost sixty but
fighting it hard he walks with the authoritative air of
a man who usually gets his way

Note Throughout Ben always wears black Armani black
slacks black jeans black sweaters black shoes And if
his hair isn’t quite black it’s certainly not gray
either He and his Madison Ave colorist makes sure of
it once a month

CUT TO

RIVERSIDE PARK

Amidst the Bicyclists and joggers competing for space on
the paths that run along the water is a basketball court
crowded with KIDS PARENTS BALLPLAYERS

SUSAN PORTER twenty-seven with big understanding eyes
and a great laugh stands with her eight-year-old son
SCOTTY The two of them are looking up at

SCOTTYS BASKETBALL

Which is caught between the rim and the backboard of a
basketball hoop

A TEENAGER jumps up knocks it through the hoop and hands
it back to Scotty

Susan nudges her son

SCOTTY
Thanks

(CONTTNURFD )

He turns to Susan
SCOTTY
If Grandpa was here hed have

gotten it for me right

SUSAN
Hed have tried

SCOTTY
Is he really coming this time

She is about to answer when she sees Ben entering the
park

SUSAN
There he is Dad Dad

Scotty sees him too Fist pump
SCOTTY
Yes Grandpa over here Come

here Grandpa

But Ben doesnt seem to notice them He moves past
toward a bench on an opposite court

As he walks by he quietly speaks to Susan

BEN
Dont call me that

SUSAN
What

He keeps walking Susan and Scotty move with him trying
to keep up

BEN
Dont call me Dad And you dont
call me Grandpa Not now

SCOTTY
What should I call you

BEN
You can call me Dad

SCOTTY
No Thats what I call my dad

BEN
OkayCall me Captain Ben

Susan turns her head

(CONTTNURFD )

SUSAN
Where’s this one

Ben gestures behind him

BEN
Back there You know what dont
look Youll screw me up

Now Susan stops and does an obvious scan of the park

SUSANS POV A tawdry looking DYE JOB leans against the
parks fence She might be staring at Ben

SUSAN
The Miami blonde

BEN
I saw her checking me out as I
walked through the fence Here
take my arm Maybe shell think
were married

Susan recoils

SUSAN
Yuk Daaaad

BEN
I told you not to call me that

SUSAN
Hows it supposed to help you if
she thinks youre my husband

BEN
Shes about 29 right

SUSAN
Yeah

BEN

At that age shes realistic but
still plenty vain

SUSAN
Which means

BEN
She might have an affair with a
married man but theres no way
shes gonna fuck a grandfather
Oh excuse me Scotty

(CONTTNURFD )

He reaches down picks up the little boy and gives hima
big hug

SCOTTY
Can you put me on your shoulders
Captain Ben

BEN
Sure

Ben tries to mask the effort it takes him to smoothly
lift the boy onto his shoulders

When Scotty finally ends up safely perched Ben whips
around to show off for the fence leaning Girl

SUSAN
Too late Captain Miami left
three minutes ago

Bens face shows disappointment And a hurt back

CUT TO

SCOTTY SWINGING

Between Ben and Susan as they walk along Broadway
towards Artie’s deli

BEN
Im bushed I have to go home
take a nap

SUSAN
A nap

They let go of Scotty who walks ahead of them just out
of earshot

BEN
Jordan called me over at midnight
By the time we finished and I got
back to my place--

SUSAN
Youre pathetic

BEN
Whatd I do I was sleeping
Phone rings shes using her
bedroom voice--

(CONTTNURFD )

SUSAN
Youre pathetic because youre
dying to tell me about it Youre
not going to take a nap You
dont take naps You just want me
to know you got laid

BEN
Its not like Im detailing the
positions we did it in

A beat Susan waits for it

BEN
She was on top Then I was Then
she turned over and--

SUSAN
Its not normal for a man to speak
to his daughter this way

BEN
That’s your husband talking He’s
provincial You’re a grown women

SUSAN
Gary didn’t say anything I just--

BEN
You can handle it

SUSAN
Thats what you say about Jordan
right to justify the fact that
you’re going to toss her ina
dumpster when youre done

BEN
She’s got the power in this one
Not me

SUSAN

No Shes got something you need
Its different

And Ben smiles real warmth behind it Susan smiles too

BEN
Why are you the one I cant con

SUSAN
If you dont want me to reveal you
to the world youre coming

(CONTTNURFD )

BEN
No I cant stay
SCOTTY
Aw
SUSAN
So just say hi and go
BEN
Your mother doesnt like it when I
leave
SUSAN

Never stopped you before

Ben doesnt answer He just puts his hand on Scottys
shoulder and using the boy as a shield enters

PJ BERNSTEINS DELI

Scotty breaks away from Ben and Susan and runs to the
back of the restaurant into the arms of NANCY KALMAN a
mid-fifties woman who has kept it together without
surgery Botox or excess make-up

She notices Ben Reacts Her words may be sharp her
manner is not Shes actually glad to see him

NANCY
Ben Im surprised you have the
time to drop in Whats the
matter no more divorcees left to
bed on the east side

BEN

NANCY

widows
She turns to Scotty
NANCY

Sit down honey
Scotty scoots in next to her

SUSAN
Hi Mom

Susan bends over kisses her mom and drops into a chair
Nancy gestures toward Ben

(CONTTNURFD )

NANCY
Why is it still good to see him
(to Ben)
Why is it still good to see you

BEN
Cause you don’t have to live with

Ben hesitates

BEN
Just a quick hello cant stay

But as he says this Bens SPIES a TWENTY-YEAR OLD GIRL
alone at an adjacent table Furtively tries to make eye
contact

BEN

Ben takes a seat that gives him a clear view of the
Twenty-Year Old Girl

Nancy laughs

NANCY
Youre too old for that one Benny

BEN
(covering)

NANCY

BEN

Ben catching himself glances to make sure the Young

Ben finally catches the eye of the Twenty-year-old Girl

(CONTTNURFD )

BENSS POV The Twenty-year-old Girl smiles back at him

JORDAN LANGER late 40s beautiful but in an
uncompromising way lies in bed Ben stands over her

Jordans daughter ALLYSON LANGER great looking
eighteen with a cool Dalton detachment leans against a
wall She is holding a box of tissues in her hand

JORDAN

(CONTTNURFD )

BEN
I promised to go with you

JORDAN

JORDAN
Allyson cant reschedule her
college interview just because I

BEN
I tried to get you to take the
shot--

JORDAN

--I hate shots

BEN
--And now you have the flu--

Allyson cuts in

ALLYSON
--Its fine Mom Ill fly up
there myself In fact Id like
that better

BEN
You see She doesnt even want my
company Id cramp her style--

Allyson speaks under her breath

ALLYSON
Stomp on it you mean

Jordan sits up with effort turns to Ben

JORDAN
Thats exactly why I want an adult
up there with her Her style
needs some cramping Otherwise
she might come home pickled

Allyson snorts
ALLYSON

I stopped getting drunk in eighth
grade Mom

(CONTTNURFD )

JORDAN
Doesnt matter You are not going
up there alone Give me a minute
with Benjamin please

Allyson hands her mother the tissues and leaves Ben

tries not to let his eyes follow her out

BEN
I dont think its a good idea

JORDAN
Didnt you retire from thinking

BEN
And we’re sure her father can’t go
with her--

JORDAN
--He’s in Macau closing on some
factory or something Besides he
makes her too tense

Jordan blows her nose Coughs

BEN
Shes not going to be more relaxed
with me She doesnt even like me
hanging around you

JORDAN
What she likes doesnt matter
Whats best for her does

BEN
Thats what my mother used to say
as she tucked me into a giant
purple snowsuit the first day of
November every year Id sweat
through the thing on the bus to
school and everyone thought I wet
my pants

If Jordan even hears this intimate admission

not acknowledge it

JORDAN
Ben she puts on this big
independent act because she thinks
shes supposed to but I know her
Please do this for me

she does

Jordan forces herself out of bed crosses to her desk

takes a piece of paper out of the printer

(CONTTNURFD )

JORDAN
Before I forget I just got the
confirmation emailed to me I
printed it for you They’re
sending a guy out tomorrow
morning

BEN
And it’s all prepped

JORDAN
It is So think of it like a
family weekend First you’ll go
have the meeting my father
arranged and then you’1ll take my
daughter up to her college
interview

It’s an order Jordan holds out the piece of paper Ben
takes it

BEN (PRE-LAP)
Location isnt the only thing that
matters of course

CUT TO

FOUR WAY INTERSECTION SOMEWHERE IN NEW JERSEY - DAY

CLOSE ON An artist’s rendering of a state-of-the-art
car dealership A giant red sign in the foreground of
the image says ‘Kalman Motors’

BEN
But anyone can see this is a
hell of an open point

PULL BACK from the mock-up to reveal
Ben striding with purpose across a large undeveloped lot

A step behind him is an automotive company exec PETE
HARTOFILIS

PETE
Nice traffic patterns

BEN
Nice Outstanding With my
private banking relationships
I’1l be up and running in no time
And this zip code spends
Daughter graduates high-school
get her an SUV with six airbags

(MORE )
(CONTTNUED )

BEN (CONTD)
Son moves into his own place put
him in a two-seater with some zip--

PETE
Your old flagship--

BEN
--Was north of here Twenty-five
miles The names still strong in
this community--

PETE
--Our research certainly shows
that the name is known in this
community But the negative
numbers

BEN
Ill sponsor the little league
the soccer the school car washes
Negatives will disappear

PETE
Mr Kalman Im going to speak
freely Out of respect Im
recommending that you get your
dealership Because the numbers
make sense Because my first job
was in the finance department of
one of your places Because I
grew up watching your commercials
‘I’m Ben Kalman New York’s honest
car dealer’ And because you
probably inspired me to go into
this business in the first place

BEN
Well Pete Im honored to know--

PETE
--But I dont think my
recommendation is going to do any
good The dealership development
committee is not in the habit of
granting open points to people who
have brought the sort of public
embarrassment to the industry that
you did

BEN
You get that recommendation sent
up to the committee Ill worry
about getting them to sign off

(CONTTNURFD )

PETE
Fair enough

BEN
Good Let me show you where the
service area will be

They move off to another section of the lot

CUT TO

FOUR WAY INTERSECTION SOMEWHERE IN NEW JERSEY - LATER

Ben leans against his car cell phone to his ear The
mock-up loosely rolled beneath his armpit

BEN

JORDAN

BEN

Yeah About this weekendI’m

me around and--

Total tone change from Jordan

(CONTTNURFD )

JORDAN (ON PHONE)
Of course she does Just like my
father wants to use fifty years of
goodwill and connections as well
as his position on a board of
directors to get an admitted
grifter a new dealership after he
almost tanked an entire companys
reputation

A beat

BENCH He looks at it for a second longer then he
should

ALLYSON

BEN
Admission building is that way

alumni

BEN

Alumnus And that just means Ive

(CONTTNURFD )

BEN
They come to see me Well they
used to when they knew they would
walk out of my office with an
endowed chair in the English
department or the ground breaking
money for an arts center

ALLYSON
What about now

BEN
They pay a courtesy call if
theyre in town to see someone
else

ALLYSON

BEN

IRATE STUDENT

IRATE STUDENT

face

BEN

Ben takes the Frisbee and whips it in the other
direction It sails high and gets stuck in a big oak
tree

The Irate Student gets in Bens face

doesnt go down though Just stands there Then he puts
Ben in a ONE HANDED HEADLOCK Bens sunglasses fly off
his face

Ben tries to free himself Can’t The Irate Student
grinds Bens head under his arm a moment longer

The Student lets Ben go and pushes him away

IRATE STUDENT
Like some arthritic punch was
gonna take me out

Ben catches his breath smooths his hair and turns to
Allyson who has been watching with an admixture of horror
and amusement

BEN
I used to have a pretty good
right

He turns back to the Irate Student who is now standing
inches from him

(CONTTNURFD )

IRATE STUDENT
What the fuck were you thinking

BEN
Well you know standard boxing
strategy go to the body weaken

Ben throws a ROUNDHOUSE PUNCH that catches the Irate
Student flush This time he falls

BEN
Seems like a sound strategy

The Irate Student rears up and takes Ben down to the
ground They wrestle Lots of grunting and groaning
Neither gains a clear edge

ANGLE ON Ben is on the bottom The Irate Student is
about to punch him in the face when a big beefy hand
comes down and lifts him off

The hand belongs to SGT JOHN HAVERFORD Campus Police
He is an enormous man about Bens age who almost busts
out of his uniform He speaks with an accent thats
Boston by way of Ireland

your indulgence

(CONTTNURFD )

CHESTON
Granted

Ben pours himself a Styrofoam stein of amber pulls from

BEN
This was the first year of

this place

Ben gestures to the Frat House

BEN
I was one of the ones actually had
a job help me pay my way--

CHESTON
Me too--

BEN
I know I saw your wardrobe
Anyway I wasnt a total innocent
but I was intimidated by some of
what I saw Especially the girls
There was this one girl sat in
front of me in Freshman
Composition Name was Jennifer
Angel Really And every day I
would stare at the back of her
neck Sometimes if she turned to
glance out the window Id catch a
glimpse of her face She was
smart And real clean looking
too Cheston my man I wanted to
get with her in the worst way
But I couldnt figure it
Couldnt screw up the courage to
even ask her out To me she was
untouchable

The whole time Cheston is staring at the girl across the
room

CHESTON
Untouchable

BEN
One afternoon Im tending bar at
some event and this prick on the
squash team orders a shot of Jack
to help him loosen his hurt back
(MORE )

(CONTTNURFD )

BEN (CONTD)
I ask him how he hurt it and he
says “Jennifer Angel”How I
ask him And Cheston his answer
was like a Joe Frazier left to the
belly I was fucking her he
says hard But she keeps begging
me to do it harder Harder
Harder Finally Im nailing her
so fucking hard that the bed
collapses and I twist my back all
up when we hit the floor

CHESTON
Jesus

BEN
Ats right I actually had to
catch my breath you know right
there in front of the guy My
face turned red hearing about it
and Im not exactly the blushing
kind But you know what Turned
out to be great Knowing how she
liked it that she liked it freed
me to talk to her And the next
week it was my bed that almost
broke Thats what you need to
learn Some fella has a story like
that on every single one of them
Might as well be you

Cheston appears rocked by the story but he also begins
moving in the direction of the Girl Ben watches him

ALLYSON (0S)

Jimmy still doesnt lift his eyes

JIMMY
I didnt run the place back then

ALLYSON AND TED

--At the very upscale OAK BAR in the Fairmont Copley
Plaza

They are sitting close to one another Its clear
theyve been drinking for some time And that Ted is
working it hard

ANGLE ON Ben who stands at the Bars entrance He can
see and hear Allyson and Ted They do not notice him

BENS POV

TED
veah and I told the lacrosse
coach that I played attack in
Junior High was All County attack
in High School and there was no
way I was playing D for him

ALLYSON
So youre playing on the front
line now--

TED

--He cut me but thats not the
point of the story I stood up
for myself Went after what I
wanted And thats what I always
do

Ted slurps his Jack and Coke

TED
--I see what I want and I take a
run at it

Ben has heard plenty He walks over to Allyson and Ted
moves between them and slides the bartender a credit
card

BEN
For their drinks

He looks to Ted

BEN
You regaling her young man I
think you are You look regaled
Allyson

Nothing from Ted but a small smile on Allysons face
All the encouragement Ben needs

BEN
Stories of what Glory Or its
putative compatriot noble
failure

(MORE )

(CONTTNURFD )

Ted doesnt know hes out of his league

BEN (CONTD)
I say putative because and this
is from a man who has failed in
Starburst colors there is nothing
noble in failure Do you not
agree Ted

College Man approach

TED
My parents named me after Theodore
Roosevelt And he said It is
not the critic who counts but the
man who fails while daring
greatly--

BEN
--Yeah but that guy didnt
actually fail Its why we know
the quote He became President
See he bumped up against failure
found a way to succeed Thats
not what I glean from your
lacrosse story

Goes with the

Allyson looks to Ted anticipating some sort of snappy

response

Gets nothing

Ben turns to the bartender

Allyson and Ben watch Ted walk away

BEN
Scotch for me

TED
Im gonna go to the bathroom
Ill be right back

BEN
On campus he seemed like one

BEN
How honest a conversation are you

drift off to my room now leave

ALLYSON

BEN
Hes a waste of time Youll go

little reward

ALLYSON

TED
But me and Allyson--

Ted looks to Allyson whose face is in her drink He
downs his drink departs Allyson and Ben watch him
leave

ALLYSON

TABLE AT THE BAR

Some time has passed Ben and Allyson have moved to a
corner table

ALLYSON

Ted It just sort of seemed like
something to do

BEN
I know how that is

ALLYSON
Is that what the Russian was

(CONTTNURFD )

BEN
No She was something worth doing
Its different

Allyson laughs Takes a long drink Her manner becomes
more relaxed with each moment that passes between them

ALLYSON

ALLYSON

--You knowwhen you’reOk

Allyson pauses for a moment

Ben makes

ALLYSON
And

a hand motion for her to continue

ALLYSON
It never feels that great really

BEN
Youve never had an--

ALLYSON

Of course I have But only by
myself What you said about what
would have happened in the room is
right I would have ended up
staring at the ceiling all night
while he slept like a log At
least in New York I could go home

BEN
Its always like that

ALLYSON
None of the guys Ive been with
really know what theyre doing I
guess

(CONTTNURFD )

BEN
Cant you tell them what to do

ALLYSON
How I dont know what to say

Ben thinks for a moment Puts a hand on Allysons
shoulder Draws closer to her

BEN
You hardly have to say anything
Just take charge move him how you
want to take his hands and put
them where they feel right

Ben drinks motions the bartender for another and
another for Allyson

BEN
And if that doesn’t work Show
him you know yourself I
promise he’1ll never forget you

ALLYSON
Itll make me seem like a whore

Drinks arrive Allyson stares into hers

BEN
Youre thinking about it wrong
When youre with a guy you like

him feel good

ALLYSON
But she can get you off--
BEN
Lets not talk about her Were

all sensual creatures Allyson We
want pleasure We want to know
how to give others pleasure But
we shy away from it We become
timid Only that leaves us
wanting Always When Im with a
woman I make it my business to
solve her Not out of the
goodness of my heart But because
it will make her want to solve me
Do you understand that

Ben leans into her She does not back away
ALLYSON
My God You mustve been an
amazing car salesman

On Ben

BEN

Pete turns his computer screen for Ben to take a look

lobbying

ALLYSON

pull that hard on the strings to
get me in Its not like my
grades are so bad or anything--

(CONTTNURFD )

JORDAN
I know how those things are
Youre a suitable enough
candidate but without BenI

(CONTTNURFD )

ALLYSON (CONTD)

gave me Its already worked

BEN
Which advice

ALLYSON
You taught me to ask for what I
want The last guy I was with it
was easy I just gave him a blow
job first before anything else
And then another one So he could
last when we finally did it And
then I got on top of him and told
him exactly what to do It was
awesome Awesome

BEN
Youre making it up

ALLYSON
Why would I make it up

Ben speaks even more quickly hoping to finish before
Jordan reemerges

BEN
To put me off you To put
distance between us I use that
trick all the time But only when
Im afraid I might actually feel
something for someone

ALLYSON
Well Im not I just did what you
told me to do when you were trying
to get me up to the room

BEN

You really crapped the bed on this
one Understand I saw the
paperwork It was prepared You

wayno way

BEN
Bring me into your house Pete
I‘1l leave you a real nice parting
gift
Pete understands the offer being put on the table

PETE

Ben nods walks away looking back just in time to see
A giant sign is being hung atop the dealership It
reads VINYARATEN MOTORS

CUT TO

GINO’S RESTAURANT

Midtown Expensive old style Italian across from
Bloomingdales

TRACK past the bar where SINGLES in Wall Street attire
drink and FIND

Ben and PAUL GERRARD finishing espressos at a table in
the back Gerrard is fifty-five shaved bald wearing a
five-thousand dollar suit

Ben puts down his espresso and gestures toward the bar
which is between their table and the front door

(CONTTNURFD )

BEN
--Count three down from the one
who looks like an Eskimo Tan
pants I’m gonna saydivorced
three years has the kids with the
dad tonight and is going to play
it for all it’s worth

GERRARD
FBI should hire you out as a
profiler

BEN

If they were smart they would
Double their clearance rate

He nods in Tan Pants’ direction

BEN
Not that hard Look No wedding
band But she showed pictures on
her phone to the bartender The
way he reacted photos had to be
of her kids Next she did one
shot and ordered another This is
why I was so strong on the lot
Id know just what kind of vehicle
to put her in and I definitely
know what she’s looking for
tonight

GERRARD
I imagine you do

Ben waves a WAITER to the table

GERRARD
Ben I’ve always enjoyed our
dinners But I can’t let you out
of here tonight without turning
the conversation in a different
direction

BEN
Yeah yeah We will we will

The WAITER comes to Ben’s side

BEN
Send two of whatever she wants to
the lady in the tan pants Tell
her I’1l be over there in a
minute

(CONTTNURFD )

The waiter leaves to do it

bar

GERRARD

Youve been a private banking

client for--

Ben holds up a hand

ANGLE ON The Waiter makes the approach

BEN
One sec Gotta watch it

Ben keeps his eyes on the

The LADY IN TAN

PANTS takes a moment to get it but then smiles over at

Ben

ON

He nods back

BEN
Okay Now I can listen without
being distracted

GERRARD
The reason institutions like ours
have private banking clients in
the first place is so that our
highest net worth individuals
don’t have to deal with financial
minutiae in the middle of their
busy days--

BEN
Youre kicking me out of the bank

Gerrard caught

BEN
After all these years It’s why
you didn’t touch your penne
segreto

GERRARD
The bank usually sends a letter
I wanted to tell you in person

BEN
If I can say this nicely Fuck
you Paul I don’t expect your
sympathy but I’ve earned your
belief I’ve done nothing but win
at business since I’m twenty-two
years old

(CONTTNURFD )

GERRARD
You had my belief That’s why
when you got into your jam we
continued to keep you and your
family in the private bank
Continued to steer deals your way

BEN
I call bullshit

GERRARD
You call what What is that

BEN
It’s what they say Point is you
pretend you stick by clients
through ‘difficult times’ but
you’re just looking for the right
moment to get the deficit off the
books

GERRARD
We are not the ones who changed
You used to wake up at three in
the morning to review business
plans and sales reports Now
youre finding your way home
through a haze of women and booze--

BEN
You never objected to the women
when some were falling off into
your lap

GERRARD
They were an amusement six years
ago Which was fine Now you
can’t even get through a meal
without jumping up--

BEN
I was just yanking you with the
stuff about the girl at the bar
I know all that because she’s a
mother from Scotty’s class Carol
Soloman I’m not really rolling
her out of here Just saying hi

GERRARD
Yanking me--

A hint of humility comes into Ben’s voice

(CONTTNURFD )

BEN
C’mon Paul give me a year to get
it going again This cripples me
I need the credibility the bank
gives me the access the backing--

GERRARD
We have to do this It’s
finished Ben

Ben sees the MAITRE-D Yells out to him
BEN
Jason Check over here Right

away

The Maitre-D comes to the table with the check leans in
close so as not to embarrass Ben

MAITRE-D
About your house account

Ben hands the check across the table to Gerrard
BEN
Hell pay it Least he can
fucking do

Gerrard hesitates for a moment then reaches into his
pocket

GERRARD

I really do wish you all the best
BEN

Sure Because what does that cost

you

Ben stands pushing his chair into the table harder than
necessary and walks toward the door of the restaurant

CUT TO

BEN’S BEDROOM

Light comes in around the edges of Ben’s blackout shades
He slowly opens his eyes Next to him Carol Soloman
the Lady In Tan Pants still sleeps

Ben reaches to his bottle of children’s aspirin takes

one His movements wake Carol She watches him recap
the bottle

(CONTTNURFD )

CAROL
Baby Aspirin huh Have you had
an incident or are you just
cautious

BEN
I seem cautious to you

CAROL
Not the first word I’d use

BEN
I don’t actually know for sure
Guy saw something on an EKG once
Wanted to run some tests

CAROL
What did they see

BEN
Never went for ‘em

CAROL
I couldn’t live like that And if
you were my husband--

BEN
Well thank God for all
involved

She slaps him mostly playfully

BEN
What do I want to know for I
just want do the things I want to
do and only the things I want to
do until it happens Whatever it
is going to be

CAROL
You seem to have infected me with
a little of that spirit Shit
How did I end up here with the
grandfather of my son’s friend

BEN
Because you’re in your late
thirties Carol In your twenties
youd have held out for a
dissatisfied father of your son’s
friend

She slaps at him again This time a bit less

playfully

(CONTTNURFD )

CAROL
Who talks like that

BEN
Everyone But most people only
say this shit to themselves I
let it fly

CAROL
And you think that’s a good thing

BEN
What I think is conversation’s
not our long suit Let’s just get
dressed

CAROL
Fine with me

She begins getting out of the bed
BEN

And although it shouldn’t need to
be voiced let’s not tell Susan

about this

CAROL
Don’t worry that’s the last thing
I want

BEN
Hey can you get a look at that
clock

CAROL
The clock

BEN

The one in the drawer on your
side I threw it in there last
night so it wouldn’t wake us up
when the alarm went off

As she’s going to the drawer

CAROL
Isn’t that the idea

BEN
I was drunk What time is it

CAROL
Early

(CONTTNURFD )

BEN
Good

CAROL
Yeah I don’t have to get the
kids until two So I have three

hours

BEN
Fuck It’s eleven

CAROL

BEN

Ben scrambles out of bed

CUT TO

OUTSIDE OF ESPN ZONE

Susan stands with Scotty and Gary on the sidewalk in
front of the Times Square arcade and entertainment
complex They are saying goodbye to a few MOTHERS and
KIDS of Scotty’s age

Ben comes half-jogging up to them as the last of the Moms
and Kids leave

BEN
Happy Birthday Kiddo

Ben pulls Scotty into a hug Susan shakes her head at
Ben Gary can barely look at him

As Ben and Scotty separate

SCOTTY
You missed the party Captain Ben

Gary bumps an eyebrow at Susan “Captain Ben” Susan
shrugs “tell ya later”

BEN
And I’m sorry about that I hada
last minute business meeting But
I’m here now

SCOTTY
Yeah but the party’s over You
didn’t get to sing happy birthday
You didn’t get any cake

(CONTTNURFD )

GARY

time I lower the bar of
expectations you limbo right
under it

Ben ignores him Speaks to Scotty
BEN

So we’1ll have our own after-party
And we’ll make it even better than

this party
SCOTTY
We will
BEN
Definitely
He turns to Susan
BEN
Are you heading back to the

apartment

Susan doesn’t respond she looks to Gary who has hailed
a cab

GARY
C’mon Scotty Susan let’s go

Susan grabs a HUGE BAG of gifts puts it in the front
seat of the taxi Then she hustles Scotty into the back
seat in between Gary and her

SCOTTY
Can he come over Please mom

Susan shuts the door shouts out the window

SUSAN
There’s no room in the cab

BEN
We can squeeze Move the presents
to the trunk

Susan speaks softly enough that Scotty can’t hear but
her anger still comes through

SUSAN
If you want to come get yourself
there And you better have a
present and a cake with you too

(CONTTNURFD )

And the car drives off leaving Ben standing there with
his hands in his pockets He turns to head towards the
subway

CUT TO

SUSANS KITCHEN

Ben Scotty and Susan stand around a Carvel cake with
nine candles in it Ben lights the candles and he and
Susan begin to sing Gary enters the room at the sound
of the singing and joins in for his son

As soon as Happy Birthday ends Gary walks back out

Ben hands Scotty a knife and helps him cut the first
piece

SUSAN
Were going to save that for after
dinner

SCOTTY

But it’s my cake

SUSAN
You already had cake today

BEN
It’s his birthday Let him have a
bite at least so I can watch

Ben cuts off a small bite for Scotty puts it in his
grandson’s mouth Scotty makes a big show of enjoying
himself Susan can’t help letting a smile come

CUT TO

SCOTTY’S ROOM

Susan stands at the doorway watching Ben and Scotty The
two of them sit right next to each other on the floor of
Scotty’s room playing Madden on PS3

SUSAN
This is the last quarter guys
SCOTTY
We just started this game No
way
SUSAN

How many have you already played

(CONTTNURFD )

SCOTTY
This is the last game of the
regular season But we’re only
playing three minute quarters so
well be done really soon

BEN
(with Scotty’s
enthusiasm)
Really soon

SUSAN
Half-hour more and that’s it you
two We have to go to your other
grandparent’s house

SCOTTY
But I want to stay with Grandpa
He said I could call him that in
private

SUSAN
Well daddy’s parents are
expecting us so we have to go

Ben makes some moves with his controller

BEN
Touchdown

SCOTTY
Hey no fair I was talking to my
mom

BEN

Snooze you lose young man

And they are back to the game Susan watches a moment
more then shuts the door

CUT TO

FRONT HALLWAY

Ben stands at the door Susan helps him on with his
coat

BEN
Bye Scotty See you this week

Scotty gives him one more hug

(CONTTNURFD )

SUSAN
I’11 walk you to the elevator

CUT TO

BUILDING HALLWAY
Susan and Ben stand by the elevator doors

BEN
I’m glad we have a minute alone
I need to ask you for another
small loan

SUSAN
You are out of your mind Gary’s
right You’ve actually lost it

BEN
What

SUSAN
I’m not giving you more money
Especially after today’s
performance

The elevator comes Ben lets it go without him

BEN
You telling me Scotty didn’t have
a great time

SUSAN
No He has a better time with you
than anyone That’s the problem
He thinks you’re magic

BEN
That’s how he should think of his
grandfather

SUSAN

No He should think of his
grandfather as consistent
reliable

BEN
Consistent is boring His other
grandparents are consistent and he
doesn’t even want to go to their
house

(CONTTNURFD )

SUSAN
But when he needs them he knows
that they’ll come running And it
makes him feel safe

BEN
That’s an illusion You know
that No one can really protect
anyone You saw what happened to
me All those so-called important
pals I had lined up over the years
went running for the hills--

SUSAN
I’m not going to go back and forth
with you about this You missed
his party He had a long face on
the whole time kept looking at
the elevator every time it opened
thinking that you were going to
come walking out Mom and I
must’ve tried your cell six times--

BEN
I didn’t mean to miss the party
My alarm didn’t go off and--

SUSAN
It’s not what you mean to do
It’s what you do And you know
whose fault it really is Mine
I let him have these hopes Just
like I did when I was his age
But I won’t anymore If you let
him down again that’s it I
can’t put him in a position to get
hurt Not when you can totally
prevent it from happening

BEN
What are you gonna do cut me off
from seeing my own grandson I
love that little boy

SUSAN
It’s not fair for you to dart in
and out at your own whim to the
extent that he can’t even have fun
at his own birthday party Either
be in his life or don’t

Susan pushes the elevator button and neither one says
another word

(CONTTNURFD )

The elevator arrives Ben slowly gets in

NANCY’S APARTMENT

CUT TO

The apartment is huge but has a warm classic style

Nancy hands Ben a glass of red wine sits across from

him

Ben moves

NANCY
It’s good for the heart
Antioxidants

BEN
Important as the future health of
my circulatory system is Nance
it’s not at the top of my list at
the moment The truth is I
can’t give you anymore checks
Not for a while

Nancy takes it in

Ben opens

NANCY
Hmm—hm

BEN
AndAnd I need to ask you to
float me some cash

NANCY
Benny I’d never let you starve

BEN
Which is thoughtful considering--

NANCY
--But I can’t support you--

BEN
--How many meals I bought you over
the years how much cash went
from me to you--

NANCY
Stop You’re not one of those
guys You didn’t even make me
take you to court

his palms

(CONTTNURFD )

BEN
You put in the years What was I
gonna do

Ben gets up wine in hand goes to the window and looks
out over New York

BEN
What am I supposed to do

NANCY
What people do What I did Move
forward You’re not who you were
I’m not either--never thought I’d
sell real estate Turns out I’m
good at it And I like it AndI
like my wine class and playing
bridge with my friends on
Wednesdays

Ben gestures out the window

BEN
And you still have the best view
in the city

NANCY
That’s why I never sold it

Ben glances back at her

NANCY
Or did you think I was holding
vigil that some day you’d return
and I wanted everything to be the
same for our reunion

BEN
You made it pretty clear you
weren’t when you shacked up with
Mark the orthodontist--

NANCY
He’s a financial--

BEN
He had the affect of an
orthodontist

NANCY

It lasted three months I know
youd rather I joined a convent

(CONTTNURFD )

BEN
I just find it interesting that
you haven’t changed the furniture
Not a chair Or a couch Not
even a cushion

NANCY
Couch still comfortable

BEN
Most comfortable couch I’ve ever
sat on

NANCY

Yeah I don’t make it a habit to
change what works That’s your
move

No answer from Ben for a long moment

BEN
Is that what you think That it
was working

NANCY
For a long time Until you
decided that nothing was working
for you

BEN
I didn’t decide Things
happened Events took place

NANCY
Youve never been the kind of
person “things happen” to You
make things happen Always have
You built your business yourself
destroyed it yourself Same with
our marriage You can blame
anyone you want me for having the
audacity to get older each year
your general managers for
“engaging in practices” you didn’t
know about the DA’s office for
being politically motivated but
until you figure out how you
actually got in this position
youll never find your way out of
it

Ben almost speaks to it Almost unburdens Instead he
just takes a sip of the wine looks back over the city

CUT TO

BENS APARTMENT

Ben in his bathrobe sits on his couch He is unshaven
PACKING BOXES are scattered across the floor His buzzer
rings

CUT TO

BENS NEW APARTMENT

Ben in his bathrobe sits on his couch watching
television

This apartment a studio with a bed in the corner is
much smaller than the old one

His cell phone rings He doesnt answer it His land
line rings He doesnt answer that one either

And then a knock on his front door He considers his
options then gets up

Standing at the door is TODD THE BUILDING MANAGER cut in
the Kevin Smith mold plenty of attitude Ben does not
ask him in

TODD

TODD

BEN
You can

TODD

start removal proceedings

BEN
By tomorrow afternoon My own
sense of honor won’t let me
default on--

Ben is cut off by a VOICE coming from down the hall We
recognize it as Susan’s before we see her

(CONTTNURFD )

SUSAN
Carol Soloman You had to fuck a
friend of mine someone I see at
school everyday Then mock her in
the morning never call her never
even return her calls You had to
put me in that position You’re
priceless Dad

BEN
Ho-ho-hold on--

By now Susan is standing at the door with Ben and Todd
who does not make it more comfortable by leaving

SUSAN
Scotty has a play date at Sean’s
house that’s Carol’s son and
when I get there to pick him up
she sits me down in their kitchen
and tells me the story Says her
nanny is going to bring Sean to
the next playdate because it’s too
awkward otherwise

BEN
What’d she expect that I’d pin
her take her to the prom Tell
her to grow up

SUSAN
It’s not about what she expects
It’s about what I expect

BEN
You expect me to be chaste To
never have sex again now that your
mother and I are divorced

SUSAN
No I expect you not to fuck my
friends
Ben turns to Todd
BEN

Do you think you could let us--
Todd enjoying it takes his time answering
TODD
By tomorrow Certified or

cashier’s Or you’re gone

Todd leaves smirking

(CONTTNURFD )

BEN
Do you want to come inside
Pumpkin--

SUSAN

No Was she really your only
option Couldn’t you have just
called a hooker if you needed it
that bad

BEN
I can’t afford to anymore The
good ones cost too much

Susan laughs but as a reflex not with any joy

BEN
You used to love my stories

SUSAN
I liked that you’d treat me as
your friend

BEN
I still do

SUSAN
But now we’re both old enough to
know you shouldn’t

Ben lets this settle for a second Then meets her eyes

BEN
You’re not a kid anymore It’s
time to realize you can’t change
your daddy

SUSAN
I’m still your child And it’s
time you realize you’re still my
father

A beat

BEN
So what do you want me to do

SUSAN
I want you to get help See
someone Maybe try medication
Something Just until you get
your balance back

BEN
No You know I’m not doing that

(CONTTNURFD )

SUSAN
Well then if you really won’t
help yourself I need you to leave
me my friends my family alone

BEN
I’m sorry to hear that

SUSAN
But not sorry enough to do
something about it
A long beat
SUSAN
You’re actually going to let us

walk out of your life

BEN
You’re making the choice Not me

Susan hesitates for a moment
SUSAN
Fine If that’s the way you need
to hear it I am making it Stay
away from us

She turns and walks away

On Ben

BEN

JIMMY

Ben takes the sliced roast beef out of the machine puts

it on a mayo’d piece of white bread adds lettuce tomato
and the second piece of bread

(CONTTNURFD )

JIMMY
But then as they started coming
back after they graduated to
homecomings and ball games and
sat at the same tables and
ordered the same food I saw
they don’t stay like this None
of ‘em They put on years
pounds lines everything And I
got one like that at home And I
can talk to her I know her

get up here sooner Everywhere my
eyes land I see soft targets
Some of these girls are real
special James

JIMMY
Ah in the end it’s all the same
It’s supposed to be young men who
confuse the differences between
young women--

BEN
Yeah Shaw I use it to mean
something different sometimes

Ben plates the roast been sandwich and walks it around
the counter

As he moves into the dining area the front door opens
and Allyson enters with a group of GIRLFRIENDS

She does not see Ben at first and works her way to a
table in the rear of the diner

Ben tries to keep his back to her as he delivers the
sandwich

On his way back behind the counter though they make eye

You are to leave that campus
tomorrow I will not have my
daughter’s environment threatened
This is her college experience I
want her to remember it fondly

BEN
Did she complain to you

JORDAN
That’s an irrelevant question

BEN
Well I’ve never approached her
never tried to--

JORDAN
Youre mistaking this for a
conversation I don’t want to have
to tell her father about
everything that’s transpired But
I will And as you know he has
a wide ranging group of contacts
And a far reach

BEN
So you’re asking me to come back
to the city--

JORDAN
I for one don’t care where you
are As long as you’re not there
Tomorrow Ben Get going Or
this file moves from my desk to
Allyson’s father’s

The phone goes silent Ben turns it off lies down on
his couch

CUT TO

CHESTON’S HOUSE

Belle and Sebastian’s Dear Catastrophe Waitress plays on
an Ipod Hi-Fi set up on the lid of an old vinyl
turntable

Cheston’s ROOMMATES MAUREEN and a good sized group of
other STUDENTS are hanging out talking over the music
Drinks cigarettes a Bong

Cheston and Ben each with a bottle of beer in hand lean
in close to one another on Cheston’s couch

At various points during the conversation Ben makes eye
contact with a TALL GIRL who has BLONDE STREAKS in her
hair

BEN
---SO now I’m thinking that maybe
Allyson wasn’t trying to get a
rise out of her mother so much as
she was trying to get my attention
through her mother You see what
I mean

CHESTON
Trying to understand behavior
through Jungian archetypes is a
slippery slope Ben

Ben realizes something

BEN
You were sneaking in some studying
this afternoon weren’t you

CHESTON
I still have to do well I told
her I was crashing out after a
morning wake and bake

BEN
Well played But back to Allyson
See I just know there was a
message being sent

Cheston closes his eyes for a moment
CHESTON
Did you get like caught up in
her or something
BEN
I might have

(CONTTNURFD )

CHESTON
But your counsel to me was to
remember that--

BEN
I say a whole bunch of shit kid
Some of it’s even true

Ben starts moving his head to the Belle and Sebastian

BEN
Is this new It’s great

CHESTON
No It’s old Really old I was
in ninth grade when it came out I
think

BEN
Good though What is it

CHESTON
Belle and Sebastian Scottish
seven-piece

Ben takes a moment scopes the whole scene Cheston’s
working

BEN
Nicely done young man nicely
done

And then he gestures toward Maureen who is lounging
across the room

BEN
-All around

CHESTON
Well being a Junior is nothing
like being a Sophomore

BEN
That’s for sure But being a
sophomore is better than being a
senior Cause it’s all in front
of you

Belle and Sebastian fades out and the IPOD shuffles to
Hoodrat Friend by The Hold Steady Ben still keeps the
time with his head

He downs his drink gets up and goes over to the Tall
Girl with Blonde Streaks

(CONTTNURFD )

BEN
Lumberjack right

TALL GIRL
What

BEN

That’s your Sunday morning
breakfast The lumberjack
special Two two and two Cakes
eggs bacon

TALL GIRL
You’re the guy who works at
McCouns I kept trying to figure
out who you were

BEN
I’m the hash slinger

TALL GIRL
Okay

Ben tries to find his in

BEN
I noticed the breakfast for two
reasons First because you’ve got
the same hair Bancroft had in Mrs
Robinson And she always drove me
nuts

No real sign of encouragement or its opposite

BEN
And I loved the fact that you had
the guts to just eat you know
fuck what people think you’re
gonna be you right

TALL GIRL
Wow That’s way more thought than
I put into it I just like

pancakes
BEN
Uh huh Cool
Music keeps playing
BEN

Great band right

TALL GIRL
They’re my favorite

(CONTTNURFD )

BEN
I remember when it first came out
Like around ‘95 I said to

myself Belle and Sebastian
they’re the future And I
listened to it that whole year

TALL GIRL
Well this is The Hold Steady
playing now

BEN
Oh

TALL GIRL
Yeah Good talking to you I’1l
umI’11 see you at McCouns

She walks to the other side of the party joins a couple
of her Friends who try not to look over at Ben

Ben heads for the cooler to get another drink Maureen
is getting a refill too Ben falls into a much more
natural rhythm with her

BEN
Cheston’s terrific isn’t he
MAUREEN
No he’s superific He thinks
you’re some kind of arch Doctor
Phil
BEN

Doctor Phil No way I’m much
more cutting edge than that He’s
mainstream And a bozo I’m like
Bill Clinton

MAUREEN
What is it with men your age and
Bill Clinton

BEN
Men my age

Ben really gets rolling now The preceding failure a
memory He begins walking to a quiet corner Maureen
follows

BEN
It’s just a good analogy Like
him I’m strong of jaw and big of
heart

(MORE )

(CONTTNURFD )

BEN (CONTD)
And although no longer on the
front lines a statesman who can
tell you just what to say and do
to get the job done

She laughs warmly

MAUREEN
Is that what you told Cheston
How to get it done He’s pretty
closed mouthed about the
specifics

BEN
Well I never reveal confidences
I want you to know that too I’d
never tell him anything you said
either Or anything I saw Or
anything that happened

MAUREEN
What’s going to happen Ben

Ben closes the distance between them a bit

BEN
That’s not actually the question
of the moment

MAUREEN
No

BEN
The question of the moment is
this are you getting enough from
the transaction

MAUREEN
The transaction

BEN
Yeah Between the two of you
Look you have jokes that Spanish
gimmick or whatever it is you can
wear each other’s clothes study
together but how can he be
getting it done for you where it
matters It’s obvious that you
get it done for him But what do
you get from the transaction

She leans in to him Speaks as quietly as she can but

with fire

(CONTTNURFD )

MAUREEN
You are a scumbag Way worse than
Clinton too He actually tried to
do some good Shit Cheston
thinks you care about him

BEN
I do This has absolutely nothing
to do with him He’d never find
out Never Listen I’m not
asking you to stop being with him
I think it’s a nice little thing
for both of you But what I’m
talking about is something else
And the very fact that you’re
still standing in with me here
tells me that you know it too

MAUREEN
I’m still standing here because
I’m deciding whether to throw this
drink in your face or not But I
don’t want Cheston to know what
you tried to do So instead I’1l
just ask you to walk away

BEN
Hey nothing personal

He turns to go She grabs him by the shoulder

MAUREEN
That’s it actually Since you
asked That’s what I get
Something personal Besides
‘getting it done’ upstairs which
he does Cheston and I reach each
other He’s tender Funny
Sweet Smart He’s a million
things that you aren’t

BEN
I was once It doesn’t last
honey

And Ben heads for the door On his way he grabs another
beer drinks it down in a gulp

THE QUADSUSAN’S BEDROOM - INTERCUT

Ben careens across the quad obviously starched He
walks past the Bench The one he stopped at before He
lingers Runs his hand across the top of the bench
Takes out his cell phone

(CONTTNURFD )

GARY

bed

SUSAN

(CONTTNURFD )

BEN (CONTD)

SUSAN

BEN

SUSAN

He thinks you’re on a long trip
where there are no phones Which
you are

Ben puts the phone back in his pocket

CUT TO

MODEST NEIGHBORHOOD

Ben walks toward Jimmy’s house

Five doors down from Jimmy’s place Ben passes a parked
LINCOLN TOWN CAR He doesn’t notice that

A man NASCARELLA gets out of the Lincoln and begins
following him

Nascarella comes up behind Ben and PUNCHES him in the

kidney

Ben goes straight down

Nascarella stands over him

NASCARELLA
I’m gonna tell you a few things
Then I’m gonna do a few things
First you’re not being robbed

Ben breathing heavy tries to get up on hands and feet

NASCARELLA
Just stay there

Ben rolls over to a sitting position

(CONTTNURFD )

NASCARELLA
Second my name is Nascarella

going to the cops about this I
had thirty years in and left with
a gold shield Plus I squared
things with the campus officer

report he wrote up Seems you’ve
thrown the first punch before

BEN

NASCARELLA

Ben meets Nascarella’s eyes

promise

BEN

Yes I’1l leave first thing in

NASCARELLA

BEN

NASCARELLA

Ben gets himself to his feet The moment he does
Nascarella is on him Even if he wasn’t drunk Ben
couldn’t do much against the man

(CONTTNURFD )

Nascarella throws punches like a technician He attacks
the ribs stomach kidneys and drops Ben back down to the
concrete with a shot to the face
NASCARELLA
Don’t ignore me No broad is
worth it
Nascarella turns and walks back to his car

Ben slowly tries to stand can’t He falls back again

JIMMY (PRE-LAP)
We gotta get you to a hospital

CUT TO

JIMMYS FRONT PORCH

Ben sits on the top step He’s bent over and has a
homemade ice-pack on his face

Jimmy sits next to him

BEN
No No hospitals Just want to
lie down

JIMMY

eyes until we get you checked out

Ben forces himself to sit up straighter

See that’s where we’re different
I never put much faith in that
whole racket

JIMMY
The friendship racket

BEN
Yeah

JIMMY
You had more pals then you knew
what to do with when you were
here

Ben wobbles for a moment Steadies himself with his arms

BEN
Look there’s a place for friends
Know where In the midrange
Because thats where everyone’s
comfortable When you’re just
like them Right in the middle
But in the highest moments the
lowest you’re alone When I was
on the cover of Forbes I was
there by myself When I was on
the cover of the times business
section in handcuffs I was by
myself again

JIMMY
That’s not--

BEN

Ben tries to take a deep breath Winces Coughs

BEN
At the top they pull at you

(CONTTNURFD )

BEN (CONTD)
And on my way to that court house--

head take a real peak in there

JIMMY

JIMMY

Solitary No companionship--

BEN

JIMMY
I’m sorry to hear that Ben I
really am

Ben gets to his feet Steadies himself Jimmy grabs him
by the arm leads him to the front door

Ben puts a hand out to grab the railing They stop
moving

JIMMY
For what its worth when you were
on the cover of Forbes felt like
I was on the cover I saved it
and everything

Ben says nothing for a long moment Then

BEN
I believe you

(CONTTNURFD )

JIMMY
Good Let’s get inside then

Jimmy turns to head in Ben takes a step toward the door
then BUCKLES falls to a knee

BEN
You know something I think that
guy might’ve busted my rib
Ben coughs once more It doesn’t sound good A little
blood comes up with it dribbles out of the corner of his
mouth

BEN
Damn

Jimmy catches Ben just as he passes out

CUT TO

HOSPITAL ROOM

Two nights later Ben taped around the chest lies
motionless

Susan sits in a bedside chair hands in her lap

After a moment Ben STIRS and opens his eyes

BEN
Susie

SUSAN
Hi Dad

BEN

Hi I can understand myself now
Ben struggles to lift his head from the pillow

SUSAN
They lowered the dose of
painkillers Had to keep it high
so you wouldn’t move too much
cause more internal damage
You’re going to be okay

BEN
You came To see me

She takes his hand in hers

(CONTTNURFD )

SUSAN

Ben puts his head back down

BEN
How long can you stay

SUSAN

Ben closes his eyes and Susan sits back in her chair
never letting go of Ben’s hand

DISSOLVE TO

MORNING IN BEN’S ROOM

Susan is gone and Ben is woken up by an Eastern European
NURSE who tends to his bandages

NURSE
You’re healing quite nicely

BEN
Still hurts like a beast

NURSE
It will be sore for some time
still The doctors will be in
after their rounds They spoke to
your doctor back in New York and
while you were under sedation they
ran a series of tests I know
they want to discuss those results
with you

(CONTTNURFD )

Ben looks

BEN
What kind of tests How did they
know who to speak to

NURSE
You told them and signed consent
forms when you came in

BEN
I don’t remember

NURSE
You wouldn’t The alcohol and
shock to your system was pretty
extreme

BEN
What kind of tests

NURSE
They did a series as I said
Concentrating on your heart

around the room

BEN
Am I still connected to any of
this

NURSE
Just the IV

BEN
Disconnect it please

NURSE
That’s against doctor’s orders

BEN
Well I’m leaving And I can’t
drag that thing behind me

Ben gathers his energy and sits up

MODEST HOUSE

A taxi slows in front of Jimmy’s house

Ben gets out and struggles up the driveway

He sees Allyson waiting on the porch

CUT TO

(CONTTNURFD )

ALLYSON
I’ve been calling the hospital
every morning They said no
visitors except family And then
today they said you left Sol
thought I’d wait here for you I
hope you don’t mind

BEN
I’ve never had a problem with it
Your father might not be thrilled
though

ALLYSON
I told my dad if anything else
happened to you I wouldn’t ever
talk to him again He knows I’m
serious because I once didn’t talk
to him for nine months He won’t
chance it

Ben eases himself down into a chair

BEN
Only daughters have that kind of
power

ALLYSON

Yeah And it’s almost enough to
keep him around

BEN
Right You have that ‘daddy
thing’ I remember
Ben’s phone rings The caller ID reads “Mass General
Hospital” Ben hits ignore
ALLYSON
Do you want me to come in for a
while
BEN
You know what I think I need to
rest

Ben hands Cheston the bag
BEN

I treated you wrong kid I’m
here to make it right

CHESTON
Really
BEN
Yep You gave me back my shirt

But I never gave you back the one
I borrowed And that’s wrong

Cheston looks inside the bag

CHESTON
This isn’t my shirt

(CONTTNURFD )

BEN
Well that particular shirt is in
a box in New York somewhere But
I picked one out I thought would
look good on you

CHESTON
Thanks

A beat Then Ben gets to it

Ben nods

Ben smiles

BEN
It’s possible there have been
other ways I treated you wrong

CHESTON
I know She told me She didn’t
want to but I saw something was
bothering herShe said you were
drunk that I shouldn’t be mad
It was just sad but that’s who
you are

BEN
See she might actually be a Good
One I forgot to tell you about

the Good Ones They’re different
than all the others And rare
When you get a Good One you don’t
want to fuck it up

CHESTON
I figured that lesson out on my
own

BEN
Yeah Cheston you would Because
you’re a good one too

CHESTON
Thanks for the shirt I have to--

BEN
Go ahead Hit those books

Cheston nods at Ben goes back inside

CUT TO

JAMES J MCCOUNS

Ben mostly healed by now and Jimmy are closing up as
the last customers leave

for dinner tonight Daily Catch
You want to come with

BEN
I think I’ve intruded enough in
your home You go take your wife
out have a wonderful time And
leave a sock on the door if you
need some alone time afterwards

JIMMY
The sock That’s right I forgot
about that

BEN

You also forget about the time me
and Nance intentionally ‘forgot’
to put the sock out just so we
could see your face when you
walked in on us

JIMMY
That I remember You had a puny
little--

BEN
Hey--

JIMMY

Ass I was saying a small ass
back then when we were kids

The men laugh with each other remembering
Jimmy throws some dishes into the washer
BEN
You know what go Let me finish
out Do the dishes You have a
great night
JIMMY
You don’t have to make that offer
twice

And Jimmy grabs his stuff and leaves

DISSOLVE TO

JAMES J MCCOUNS
Some time has passed Ben dries the last of the dishes

puts them away He grabs his jacket walks out the front
door and locks it

QUAD

Ben makes his way across the quad The first signs of
Spring are about

It’s fairly quiet although there is a twilight Frisbee
golf game going on

Ben watches the kids throw a few then continues walking

Suddenly he stops He sees

NANCY SITTING ON THEIR BENCH

She smiles at Ben He returns it No mixed feelings
He’s really glad to see her

She motions for him to come sit down He does

BEN
Hi Nance

NANCY
Let’s save ‘hi’ for a sec
I just want an answer No
equivocating

BEN
Okay

NANCY
When was the first time a doctor
sent you for a heart scan

Ben reacts

BEN
Hospital called you

NANCY
They called Susan

BEN
You have the results

NANCY
I do Now answer me

(CONTTNURFD )

BEN
Doctor Steinberg ordered that test
about six years ago

NANCY
How long after that did you start
cheating

BEN
That day

NANCY

Uh huh And you never went for
the test did you

BEN
Nope

Silence from Nancy

BEN
Look I can’t use that as an
excuse It was a factor but
everything was building up anyway

NANCY
Building up how

BEN
I was turning invisible
NANCY
Invisible
BEN

You couldn’t understand Nance
Thirty years ago when I walked
into a room the room changed
Just ‘cause I showed up Out of
college self-made great shape
TV commercials all of it

NANCY
I remember I was right there
next to the camera when you shot
them

BEN
Then you remember what I was like
back then A lion And that’s how
people treated me But it started
to change the past ten or twelve
years I’d walk into a room and
only the older crowd would notice

(MORE )

(CONTTNURFD )

A beat

BEN (CONTD)
Because they knew who I was But
to everyone else invisible

NANCY
You were never invisible to me

BEN
Doesn’t count You were my wife

NANCY
It’s what happens Bennie we get
old

BEN
Hey I accept that it’s
biological But I can’t accept
that it happened to me When
Steinberg thought he saw something
on my EKG I got nervous at first
He told me to go get that heart
scan to see how much blockage
there was I walked out of his
office with every intention of
getting it checked out

NANCY
Instead

BEN
Instead I went to some bar and
grill on Lexington Ave had a
couple to calm myself and took
the first young lady who said
‘yes’ to a suite at the Carlisle

BEN
That was the first time I ever
stepped out on you

NANCY
What’d it do for you

BEN

The truth--it did plenty
NANCY

And then
BEN

And then I felt horrible I’d
broken something The only thing
that had ever counted Me and
you

(MORE )

(CONTTNURFD )

BEN (CONTD)
It was over after that between us
Even if you didn’t know I did I
knew we could never make it work
again after that

NANCY
So you not only cheated you
wouldn’t even give me the chance
to forgive you

BEN
Would you have

NANCY
I don’t know I think so

BEN
I figured you’d see it on my face
know straight away But you
didn’t Nothing happened So I
kept going

NANCY
Of course

BEN
And then not long after I was at
my shop in White Plains And I
saw all those cars sitting there
in the lot And I thought why am
I ‘New York’s honest car dealer’
So I got the guy who inspected the
floorplanning for the car company
and we worked it out He’d
pretend I had more cars on the lot
than I really did and I’d send
him on vacations all around the
world I also let my managers
know that I wouldn’t be checking
their work as closely as I had in
the past freed them up to work
whatever they wanted And again
Nobody seemed to notice For
years

NANCY
And the whole time you knew that
your heart could blow at any
second so you wouldn’t have to
pay the price Why didn’t you go
get the test to find out for sure

(CONTTNURFD )

BEN
I’m going to give some doctor that
kind of power over me to tell me
the where when and how No way
You know how it is at our age The
best thing a doctor says is ‘the
survival rate is high’ Or ‘it’s
a good cancer’ Or ‘we got it
early’ I decided I didn’t want
to hear any of it And I
certainly wasn’t going to let them
put me on a bunch of beta blockers
and other crap to slow me down
level me out I was going to
live on my own terms right up
until the fucking thing in my
chest exploded

NANCY
And the screwing around and the
stealing it all made you feel
alive like you were cheating
death didn’t it

BEN
Worked for a while

NANCY
Well you can’t cheat it Benny
No one can It’s gonna get you no
matter how many nineteen year olds
you talk into your bed

BEN
I know that now I really do
know

NANCY

Well I am going to share these
results with you Since I have
the information you need the
information

Nancy takes a MANILLA ENVELOPE from her bag

NANCY
The cardiologist at Mass General
said you have the heart of a forty-
year-old No calcium deposits
No blockages

BEN
None But the EKG

(CONTTNURFD )

NANCY
The EKG was inconclusive That’s
why Steinberg ordered the test
The scan’s in that envelope With
the report

Nancy hands the Envelope to Ben

NANCY
All else being equal you’re going
to be around for years and years
You better figure out how you want
to live them

Ben sets the envelope down on his lap unopened

NANCY
I thought a lot about how I want
to live driving here and what I
came up with is with the guy I
met on this bench The guy who
gave me my daughter But I don’t
know if that guy still exists If
he doesn’t I have to move on for
good Because I know this ride
isn’t meant to be taken alone

BEN
Why would you give me that shot

NANCY
For the same reason I chose you
when we were here You weren’t
like everyone else You were
smarter You worked harder You
weren’t some rich kid full of shit
and your father’s wing tip shoes
And you were kind

BEN
But it was a lie In the end I
was just as bad as all of them
NANCY
No You just stopped believing
you were different
Ben listens hard moved
BEN
I hurt you And Susan I’m
sorry

They look at each other

(CONTTNURFD )

NANCY
I’m parked right over there
Happy to drive you back to New
York if you’re ready Happy to
let you sleep on our couch while
we figure it all out And as you
know it’s a damn comfortable
couch

Nancy smiles Ben returns the warmth

BEN
I knew that’s why you kept it

NANCY
Hey--that couch is all I’m
offering for now

BEN
Understood

Nancy stands
NANCY
Take a minute Read those
results Think about what you
really want

She walks away gets into her car which is parked at the
edge of the quad

Ben takes the Heart Scan Results out of the envelope
reads them

He looks up Sees Nancy in her car Smiles at her
Leans forward to get up

And then he notices crossing right by him a BEAUTIFUL
YOUNG GIRL His eyes follow her as she approaches the
campus bookstore

Ben looks back to Nancy

Looks back to the Girl

Looks back to Nancy

Back to the Girl

And then after one more moment’s thought he stands

We

CUT TO BLACK
