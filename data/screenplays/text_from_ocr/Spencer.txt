INT SANDRINGHAM KITCHEN - DAY 1

The kitchen is functional and stripped totally bare of
anything that isn’t screwed down Large windows allow thin
winter light inside and a brass tap drips water into an empty
sink

On the wall is a large sign ‘Keep noise to a minimum They
can hear you’

Caption ‘England’
Fade out and up
Caption ‘Christmas Eve’

The caption fades but we stay with this image of an empty
kitchen for a few moments Then we hear a door being
unlocked After a moment a staff sergeant from the 20
Squadron Royal Corps of Transport in full uniform enters and
we see him from the back as he looks around and opens a
couple of cupboards to peer in His heavy boots thump on the
tiled floor

The cupboards are all completely empty and wiped clean

His military radio crackles into life The soldier puts it
to his mouth as he half turns to us

STAFF SERGEANT WOOD
Hello 3 All clear Bring it in

Driving music begins Suddenly

EXT SANDRINGHAM DRIVEWAY - DAY 2

A fleet of seven military vehicles are thundering up the
driveway of the large mid Victorian country house The
vehicles drive between two lines of trees choking out black
exhaust into the frozen air

We cut close to the huge wheels rolling over a dead and
already squashed pheasant one two three four trucks

We come around and see the country house ahead But for now
we see it only briefly Suddenly

EXT COUNTRY ROADINT MODEST FAMILY SALOON CAR - DAY 3
-close on the wheels of a small car tiny compared to the

military trucks We pull wide to see a car driving too fast
between high hedges It takes a bend at sharp speed
Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021

The driver is a woman but we don’t see her face clearly The
car is a family saloon and as it zooms by we read the
sticker in the back ‘Baby on board’

EXT SANDRINGHAM —- DAY 4

Music roars on The fleet of military trucks have begun to
park and soldiers jump out as doors are slammed There is no
need for orders or instruction since every soldier knows what
they must do They go to the back of the trucks where two
soldiers jump into the back of each truck Sheets cover boxes
which might contain ammunition or explosives

The door to the house is already open and the soldiers begin
to carry the boxes and hampers into the house like ants We
see a soldier carrying a small plastic Christmas tree
carelessly upside down

EXT A ROAD AND B ROAD JUNCTION - DAY 5

The saloon car appears around a bend and pulls up at speed as
it reaches the ‘A’ road We are head on to the car A 1980s
pop song is playing inside the car

We see the face of the driver She takes a breath She looks
at a map book that is open on the passenger seat She hisses
to herself

DIANA
Where the fuck am I

She then checks her watch and laughs recklessly into her hand
at how late she is She hooks her hair back behind her ear as
she looks to check the road is clear We will learn that
this is DIANA

We move wide and see her car parked in the road She turns up
the volume on the cassette player as she pulls out

INT SANDRINGHAM KITCHEN - DAY 6
The soldiers are placing the boxes and hampers in neat rows
on the kitchen floor One looks out of the window and calls

out

LANCE CORPORAL JACOBS
Civilians approaching Staff

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 3

EXT SANDRINGHAM KITCHEN STAFF ENTRANCE - DAY 7

We see a line of chefs in chef whites walking in single file
toward the kitchen They look like an alternative military
The kitchen door ahead opens

INT SANDRINGHAM KITCHEN - DAY 8

Eight men and six women in chef whites enter and waste no
time They begin to check the labels on the boxes and
hampers handwritten on large labels

We come close to one of the chefs the HEAD CHEF (DARREN
MACGRADY) He opens a box and we find it is full of very
sharp kitchen knives Only now we start to understand the
soldiers had not been delivering military gear at all

As the chefs in white uniforms have entered the soldiers in
their green uniforms all leave As the last soldier departs
a very old iron bell rings high in a corner of the kitchen
Darren looks up at it and takes a breath with knife in
hand

DARREN
Brigade Once more unto the
breach

The music swells The brigade all yell in unison from within
their various tasks

BRIGADE
Yes chef

EXT SANDRINGHAM DRIVEWAY - DAY 9

A long black Bentley followed by a Range Rover from the
Royalty Protection Department drive up the driveway as the
military trucks pull over into cut-outs in the single lane
road to let them pass As it passes we glimpse PRINCESS
ANNE and MARK PHILLIPS on the backseat of the Bentley The
military trucks are driving in the opposite direction but
pull over in face of the Bentley which speeds past them

EXT NORFOLK PETROL STATION ROADHOUSE CAFE - DAY 10

We find Diana’s saloon car pulling up into the car park
Once parked Diana pulls the handbrake The music ends

Diana reacts to anxiety with a deep breath She turns to the
open page of a map book on the passenger seat She stares at
it and blinks away frustration

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021

After a moment she decides there is no choice and she gets
out of the car She walks toward the lonely looking cafe
pulling on unnecessary sunglasses

INT ROADHOUSE CAFE - DAY 11

A handful of truck drivers and a family sit eating cafe food
and drinking tea with waitresses preparing trays Diana
walks into the cafe The bell on the door tinkles as she
addresses the middle-aged waitress

DIANA
Excuse me I’m looking for
somewhere

She takes off her sunglasses and expects the reaction

DIANA (CONTD)
--and I have absolutely no bloody
idea where I am

The waitress turns to Diana and in shock drops the silver
spoon she is holding Other heads turn and jaws drop

DIANA (CONTD)
There are no signs anywhere Where
am I

There is stunned silence as the entire cafe stares at Diana
She smiles

DIANA (CONTD)
Yes Me Hello

Diana looks around sees a family with young children
staring at her in astonishment A boy of six is the only one
who keeps eating using his fingers to dip chips into tomato
ketchup

Diana peers at him and speaks to break the stunned silence

DIANA (CONTD)
They look nice

The boy pops another chip into his mouth then turns and
casually offers Diana a chip All eyes are on her everyone
disbelieving Diana smiles that famous smile

DIANA (CONTD)
Oh Thank you

She takes a chip and is about to eat it

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021

BOY
Better with ketchup

A pause

DIANA (SOFTLY)
Of course

She dips the chip into the ketchup

DIANA (CONTD)
Thank you

She puts the chip into her mouth and the boy goes back to
eating Everyone else is frozen Diana swallows and takes a
moment

DIANA (CONTD)
So Anyway As I say I’m very
lost and very late and very anxious
to find out where the hell I am

EXT SANDRINGHAM DRIVEWAY - DAY 12
Music resumes

A second fleet of cars is arriving this time two dark
Bentleys and two Range Rovers In the back seat window of
the second limousine we see the face of a boy ten years old
staring out mournfully from the interior We will learn that
this is WILLIAM His ghostly face is gone in a second The
Range Rovers have blue flashing lights on the windscreen and
quarter lights as they shoot past

As this second convoy approaches the first convoy fires up
and begins to drive back down the lane

INT SANDRINGHAM ENTRANCE HALL - DAY 13

We are close on the dial of an ancient looking weighing
machine as it registers a weight We pull wide to see a
woman in her forties (PRINCESS ANNE) standing on the weighing
machine We don’t get a good look at her as we see her from
behind favoring the weighing machine as the ancient dial
passes its judgement on her reflection

(The machine has a ceramic motto printed on the front plate
but we don’t get to read it yet Later we will)

The Queen Mother’s equerry (MAJOR ALISTAIR GREGORY) stands
beside Anne holding her winter coat

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 6

Major Gregory is a fierce and almost sinister Scots ex
military man and his reflection invades the weighing machine
as he studies the dial

Major Gregory reads the dial on the weighing machine and
makes a note of the weight in a very large and old leather
bound ledger ANNE has a cut glass accent as she breaths
softly

ANNE
‘Half of my weight is jewellery

anyway’
Anne glances at Gregory

ANNE (CONTD)
Do you remember when she said that

Gregory smiles (these two know each other well)

MAJOR GREGORY
I wasn’t here But I heard about
it

ANNE
Is she here yet

MAJOR GREGORY
Not yet no

Anne steps off the weighing machine and bends to put her
shoes back on

ANNE
Then she’s late

As she speaks Major Gregory looks out through the port hole
window We hear car doors slamming as the Bentley and Land
Rovers of the second convoy park and personal protection
officers jump out Anne straightens

ANNE (CONTD)
And he is early

Gregory repeats with amused emphasis

MAJOR GREGORY
And yet she is late

(They speak dryly as if this is some familiar back and
forth) Anne takes back her winter coat

ANNE (UNSURPRISED)
Well well well

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021

Anne walks

EXT NORFOLK COUNTRY LANE - DAY 14

Diana’s saloon car is driving faster now around a bend and
brakes in time to allow a tractor to rumble past As it
passes Diana gets out of the car and yells

DIANA
Excuse me

The tractor driver doesn’t hear over the roar of his engine
and rumbles on Diana is left amid the alien corn as the
engine noise turns to bird song and the hiss of a wet wind

We study her mixture of amusement and terror for a moment as
she checks her watch She speaks out loud to this windy
isolation

DIANA (CONTD)
Of course I could just keep
driving And driving and driving

She takes a breath

DIANA (CONTD)
Where would they put that Where
would that go on the list of
horrors

Then Diana hears a car approaching She quickly steps into
the road The car is a mint condition Land Rover and Diana
instantly reacts The car slows and stops ten yards away

The DRIVER lowers his sun visor and is hidden The passenger
gets out We are surprised to see it is the head chef
Darren He speaks to Diana in a surprised but familiar tone

DARREN
What are you doing here Diana

He almost glances back at the hidden driver and remembers

DARREN (CONTD)
-Your Royal Highness

DIANA
I’m lost Where am I If it’s you
I must be close yes

DARREN
Yes I’ve just been in the
village The house is just
there

OF
Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021

Darren is bewildered

DARREN (CONTD)
But why are you driving yourself

DIANA
Cars don’t drive on their own

DARREN
I mean where’s your driver Where’s
your security detail

DIANA
I don’t know I was in the cafe in
Kensington giving some gifts and I
thought I might as well just drive

Darren approaches

DARREN
Do they know

DIANA
No I just drove

He reacts with incredulity but swallows it and finally

smiles

DARREN
Anyway Hello again

DIANA
Hello Is everybody else there

DARREN
Apart from Her Majesty

Diana nods gently and looks out over the wet fields
sees a scarecrow in a heavy dark coat

DIANA
Ah Look Of course Now I know
where I am We used to call him
Bertie

She gestures at the scarecrow
DIANA (CONTD)
I think that’s my father’s coat

he’s wearing

Darren looks to the scarecrow and back to Diana She
his look of puzzlement and smiles

She

sees
Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 9

DIANA (CONTD)

When I was little we used to live
just over that hill My Papa used
to give the farmer his old
clothes

She looks back to the scarecrow

DIANA (CONTD)
How could I get lost in a place
where I used to play

Darren checks his watch and looks concerned at the time and
Diana’s mood

DARREN
You really should go

DIANA
Will they kill me do you think

DARREN
Just say you got lost

DIANA
I’m going to check

DARREN
Check what

Diana climbs over a gate and walks toward the scarecrow
Darren reacts with exasperation and calls out incredulous
but respectful

DARREN (CONTD)

Ma’am It’s sandwiches in fifteen
minutes We should go You can
follow me

Diana doesn’t respond and trudges on through the wet field
As she does the driver of the Land Rover raises his sun
visor and we see his face behind sunglasses watching her go
without expression

Diana arrives at the scarecrow She checks the label of the
coat Then she unbuttons the overcoat and takes it off the
scarecrow She heads back with it over her arm dripping and
flecked with bird shit Darren speaks softly to himself
registering concern at her behavior

DARREN (WITH FOREBODING) (CONTD)
Jesus

Diana clambers back over the gate

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 10

DIANA
It is It’s my Papa’s old one

The dirty sodden overcoat drips water and Darren glances at
it

DARREN
Look just follow us OK Say
there was a big tractor broken
down

Diana heads for her car and dumps the coat on the back seat

DIANA
Don’t worry I’11 tell the truth
I’ll say I got lost They’1l just
roll their eyes It’s too late for
trying broken tractors on them

She gets into the car and fires her engine and waits Darren
gets back into the Land Rover Diana winds down the window

and waves Darren on to overtake as if she is now in charge

Darren looks ahead and speaks softly to the driver

DARREN
Can we pretend that didn’t happen

The driver still without expression fires the engine

OMITTED 15
INT SANDRINGHAM WILLIAM AND HARRY’S BEDROOMNURSERY
EVENING

We see William again his face to the glass of a window this
time looking out at the driveway where the Bentleys and
soldiers arrived He hears engines and prepares He looks
disappointed to see a huge Rolls Royce with royal livery
coming at stately pace with police motorcycle out riders
followed by a second limousine and more Range Rovers with
flashing lights The cavalcade drives toward the house and
William sighs

Then a few moments later Darren’s van and Diana’s saloon car
appear on the drive They are thirty yards behind the
cavalcade from the sublime to ridiculous Darren’s van
brakes at a cut out In wide we see him wave Diana on
Diana’s saloon overtakes and follows on the heels of the
cavalcade

William smiles wistfully

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 11

WILLIAM
Oh Mummy

William leaves the room to go and greet her We stay at the
window

On the drive Diana’s car brakes as the cavalcade parks
outside the house We sense her anxiety her uncertainty
just in the stopping of the car Darren is parked behind
her

Liveried palace attendants open car doors and THE QUEEN
(still in very wide) gets out of the Rolls Royce While
footmen are taking care of the luggage the Queen’s Corgis
are jumping from the backseat of the second limousine and
catching up with her We see Major Gregory and the land agent
of Sandringham bowing elaborately as The Queen and PRINCE
PHILIPP pass and enter the house

Diana’s car waits until the door to the house is closed
Dianas car finally drives toward the house and the closed
door

We watch as Diana’s car parks outside the front entrance and
Darren’s car forks off to head for the staff entrance

The car stays parked for a long time We are still in wide
and imagine her anxiety as she prepares At last Diana gets
out to face the nightmare ahead

INT SANDRINGHAM ENTRANCE —- EVENING 17

Once again we are close on the weighing machine Through the
round fish bowl window we see Diana getting out and hurrying
to the door A footman PAUL opens it and Major Gregory
gets to his feet and opens the ledger beside the weighing
machine Diana flusters as the door opens

DIANA
They’re all here aren’t they

FOOTMAN PAUL
Yes Your Royal Highness

Diana takes off her coat and gives it to Paul

DIANA
Balls Balls

Major Gregory steps forward and bows gently and gestures at
the weighing machine suggesting that the meaning is obvious
Diana shivers in the cold
Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021

DIANA (CONTD)
Oh Hello No Gary usually lets
me off

Major Gregory raises his head and angles it

MAJOR GREGORY
‘Gary’ Your Royal Highness

DIANA
The normal page The usual
Christmas page We have a thing
Between us An understanding I
don’t usually do the getting
weighed thing I’m half jewellery

anyway
She laughs

DIANA (CONTD)
That’s what I always say

She looks to Paul

DIANA (CONTD)
I’m not though It’s a joke

Paul smiles Major Gregory doesn’t smile

MAJOR GREGORY
It is tradition ma’am

DIANA
I know Everyone weighed in and
weighed out for Christmas But Gary
just writes something down

Major Gregory looks to Paul and speaks with disdain

MAJOR GREGORY
Who is ‘Gary’

Diana considers an explanation but checks her watch Major
Gregory continues

MAJOR GREGORY (CONTD)
Ma’am Her Majesty herself just a
second ago stepped on these scales
Her Majesty herself She was very
insistent that everyone joins in

Diana studies the military resolve on Major Gregorys face
and defies a little

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021

DIANA
I don’t think I’ve seen you before

MAJOR GREGORY
This is my first Sandringham duty

Diana nods gently

DIANA
To make sure everyone joins in

Major Gregory bows slightly

MAJOR GREGORY
They said no one is above
tradition

Diana studies him a little longer then steps past him

DIANA
OK fine I’m in enough trouble

She steps on the scales The machine clicks and her weight
is measured

DIANA (CONTD)
We have to put on three pounds
minimum before we leave to prove
that we enjoyed Christmas yes

MAJOR GREGORY
That is the tradition

Major Gregory studies the dial on the weighing machine pen
in hand and speaks gravely

MAJOR GREGORY (CONTD)
It was Prince Albert in 1847 who
began it

He makes a note of the weight

MAJOR GREGORY (CONTD)
It’s meant to be a bit of fun

Diana steps off the scales

DIANA
Oh it is It’s a lovely bit of fun
I will do what I can But no
promises Always catching up
Always Youll just have to get
used to that

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 14

Major Gregory turns to her and confronts the idea that he
might be someone who makes allowances Then suddenly a
door flies open and William runs to Diana For the first
time we see genuine delight on her face William runs to her
and Diana hugs him and twirls him around

DIANA (CONTD)
I’m in terrible trouble

WILLIAM
What happened

(She tells the lie she said she wouldn’t tell)
DIANA
A tractor broken down I had to
help mend it With my finger
nails

She claws the air and William laughs

DIANA (CONTD)
Is the bedroom cold again this

year
WILLIAM
Yes
DIANA
I always tell them but they don’t
listen

Major Gregory is still close and steps up

MAJOR GREGORY
Ma’am if the bedroom is cold

DIANA
The bedrooms are always cold It’s
tradition it’s a bit of fun

We see that Diana hides her fury and frustration behind these
light flippant repeated phrases

MAJOR GREGORY
-I will have more blankets
delivered

Diana smiles over the controlled exasperation

DIANA
Or turn the heating up Just turn
it up

(MORE)
Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 15

DIANA (CONTD)
Why don’t they just turn the
heating up instead of burying
everyone in blankets Every year I
say

From nowhere

HARRY
Mummy

Harry has wandered behind William and is looking up at Diana
He is wearing a thick overcoat buttoned up to the chin
almost burying his face He looks like a miniature grown-up
in the overcoat that dates back to the sixties He is
serious and speaks somberly

HARRY (CONTD)
Mummy I’m cold

Diana grabs him and hoists him and squeezes him

DIANA
Who gave you this big hilarious
coat

Diana cuddles him out of love and warmth Gregory dares to
intercede

GREGORY
The coat is from the store room
He kept saying he was cold

Diana spins around with Harry in her arms

DIANA (BRIGHTLY LOUDLY)
And instead of turning up the
heating they dressed you up like
Winston Churchill

She kisses his nose Suddenly a door half hidden by oak
panelling opens and a second footman Brian appears and bows
gently (in this house staff often appear from nowhere
stepping out of the shadows as if the house itself is always
watching) Diana jumps a little

FOOTMAN BRIAN
Your Royal Highness The family
are all gathered in the drawing
room for the sandwiches They are
waiting

Diana puts Harry down and prepares

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 16

DIANA
Oh The sandwiches yes The
sandwiches The holy sandwiches

She smiles

DIANA (CONTD)
Good To the sandwiches I’11 be
there in a minute

Diana walks away to general alarm

MAJOR GREGORY
Ma’am

WILLIAM
Mummy

Diana pushes the door open hard and disappears her pushing
of the door suddenly expressing her true mood Major Gregory
glances at the footmen A silent confirmation of resolve
from Major Gregory

INT SANDRINGHAM CORRIDOR GROUND FLOOR - EVENING 18

We see Diana walking quickly down the dark corridor humming
to herself giving herself courage and company She pushes
open a bathroom door

INT SANDRINGHAM BATHROOM GROUND FLOOR - EVENING 19

Diana comes through the door and goes to the sink She
turns on the taps and begins to wash her hands

As she looks down she sees the hands and arms of someone
four stone heavier in the running water

Diana reacts but we see these illusions are not unexpected
She turns off the taps and raises her head to the ceiling and
begins to sing the song she was singing before in the same
scared light hearted way (The overweight Diana is a phantom
which we will see only in glimpses of body parts throughout
short and fast cuts)

She clenches her fists as she looks to the ceiling

DIANA
Three days So what That’s all

We see glimpses of the overweight Diana clothes straining at
the seams walking with purpose toward a cubicle and closing
the door Her feet slap heavily on the tiles She locks it

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 17

INT SANDRINGHAM DARK CORRIDOR UPSTAIRS - EVENING 20

Diana is walking very quickly between the light of high
windows with portraits of Queens and Princesses peering down
at her Ahead we see a clothes rack on wheels being pushed
The person pushing is invisible just a clicking of heels
Then as Diana passes

DIANA (ASTONISHED)
Maggie

A woman in her late thirties practically dressed is pushing
the trolley She instantly reacts to seeing Diana

MAGGIE
Oh my God didn’t they tell you
I’ve got you again I bagged you
They gave me to you because I
insisted

They hold each other’s arms fizzing with delight

DIANA
Good Hope

MAGGIE
These are your dresses for the
whole thing I was up all night

DIANA
I have to run I’m in such trouble
Listen I’ve put a coat in my room
I want you to clean it and sew it
up or whatever it needs

She runs

MAGGIE
A coat from where

DIANA
From ancient history

MAGGIE
Whose ancient history

Diana stops for a moment

DIANA
Spencer ancient history

She runs again

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 18

DIANA (CONTD)
I’m really in such terrible
trouble

Diana turns and runs We are close on Diana’s face as she
runs past leaded windows Suddenly

EXT SCARECROW FIELD - DAY 21

-We are close on the face of a twelve year old girl as she
runs in a field with dark clouds gathering behind her

She runs in a circle and in the middle of the orbit we see
the same scarecrow that Diana examined but wearing different
clothes A group of four children play around it running in
a circle and firing imaginary guns at it

The young girl of twelve (DIANA 12YRS) stops and yells
out

DIANA 12YRS
Stop Stop Enough I think
Bertie’s dead

A pause they all stop running and catch their breaths Diana
12yrs goes to the scarecrow and takes his straw arm and takes
his ‘pulse’ She very theatrically bows her head and lets
the arm drop

DIANA 12YRS (CONTD)
Yes Poor Bertie Quite dead We
killed him

Another boy of nine Diana’s brother Charles pulls a watch
from his pocket

CHARLES SPENCER 9YRS
Diana it’s nearly one o clock We
have to get back They’1l kill us

The others all run away back toward the lane Diana 12yrs
stays staring at the scarecrow and we stay with her face
She looks at the buttons on the coat then looks around The
others have run into the distance

Crows call as Diana takes a moment to stare at her father’s
coat She then turns to walk in pursuit of the others As we
watch her walk from over the shoulder of the scarecrow we
hear Diana as voiceover

DIANA (OOV)
I was always last back Always
late For everything

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 19

INT SANDRINGHAM WILLIAM AND HARRY’S BEDROOMNURSERY - NIGHT

Diana and William are lying on the bed facing the ceiling
day dreaming through precious free time away

DIANA
I’d get home twenty minutes
after the others but everyone would
just laugh

Diana sits up and checks her watch on the bedside table

DIANA (CONTD)
Id actually forgotten all about
the scarecrow until today I can’t
believe he’s still watching over
us

WILLIAM
How can he watch us

Diana gets to her feet and goes to the window After a
moment

WILLIAM (CONTD)
Mummy are you alright

Diana turns back to the window and pushes the curtain back
and looks out

DIANA
No of course I’m not alright

There is a knock on the door (there will always be a knock at
the door) A footman speaks through it

FOOTMAN BRIAN (OOV)
Ma’‘am They are about to open the
presents

DIANA
Yes Coming

William studies her as she puts on her diamond crusted watch
WILLIAM
Mummy Why do we have to open our
presents on Christmas Eve Why not
Christmas day like everybody else

William walks to join her at the window
Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021

DIANA
Because that’s the way it’s always
been You know at school you do
tenses Past present and future
Well here there is only one tense
There is no future and the past and
the present are the same thing

William stares with Diana

WILLIAM
Daddy told Harry it’s because
Father Christmas does Queens and
Kings the day before everybody else
so we get the best presents

DIANA
Actually that was my little
fabrication

WILLIAM
Daddy confirmed it

DIANA
So there It must be true

William stands on tiptoe

WILLIAM
Can we go to the house where you
used to live

DIANA
No it’s boarded up It’s dangerous
apparently They said ‘it’s
dangerous’ You know in those
voices Like doors closing

Another knock on the closed door

FOOTMAN BRIAN (OOV)
Ma’am the others are waiting

William tugs her hand

DIANA

You go I’1l join you in a minute
WILLIAM

Do you like them getting mad at

you

Diana smiles

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 21

DIANA
Oh yes terribly

A pause

WILLIAM
Mummy what’s happened

DIANA
It’s Christmas Everything waits
until after Christmas Go

William leaves and closes the door Diana stares across the
misty fields and we sense that something indeed has happened
and William felt it It will be revealed but without words
Then the door opens and William leans in

WILLIAM
Major Gregory said you really have
to come right now

Diana turns and smiles and heads for the door

DIANA (BRIGHTLY)
What happened to Gary I wonder Too
soft I bet

She leaves and closes the door We stay in the room for a
moment Diana then comes back in and shuts the door and
clenches her fists and screws her eyes closed and stands in
taught silence for a few seconds

DIANA (CONTD)
Fuck Fuck

Then she straightens turns and goes back out

INT SANDRINGHAM RED DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT 23

A fire is dying in the grate Above the fire is a large
portrait of Queen Victoria in her mid thirties dressed in
black

Two maids are working One MARIA is clearing up brightly
coloured wrapping paper which is strewn all over the
beautiful Persian carpet We should guess the opening of
presents is over (We will usually join these family events
after they are over) The other maid PAMELA is vacuuming
the carpet as it is cleared Maria stuffs the wrapping paper
into a large black bin bag She then reacts as she finds a
pearl necklace among the discarded paper She holds it
up
Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 22

MARIA
Look Someone forgot this

At that moment Diana enters Pamela instantly turns off the
hoover and they both curtsey and stand to attention

DIANA
I left something

Maria quickly holds up the pearls

DIANA (CONTD)
Behind

Diana smiles and takes them

DIANA (CONTD)
Ah There Thank you

The maids hover a little anxious in Diana’s presence Diana
puts the pearls on around her neck She goes to the huge
ornate mirror beside the fireplace She studies herself the
maids framed in the reflection either side of her one
holding the hoover (often these reflected images should
resemble royal portraits from down the centuries but with odd
modern elements like the vacuum cleaner)

DIANA (CONTD)
What do you think

MARIA
They’re very beautiful Your Royal
Highness
Diana nods
DIANA

Martha isn’t it

MARIA
Maria Ma’am

Diana stares in the mirror She speaks brightly even though
what she is about to say is a desperate revelation

DIANA
My husband doesn’t know it but I
saw a photo and she was wearing
exactly the same pearls He bought
exactly the same for her And he
doesn’t even realise

The air freezes and the maids stand awkwardly They evidently
know who she is referring to know the gossip (as should we)
Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021

As we continue we will infer without it being verbalised
that these are the days when Charles’s affair became a
breaking point in the marriage

A long time passes Diana smiles and speaks brightly and
quickly

DIANA
That’s why I left them behind As a
gesture But then I thought about
it and knew you’d hand them in to
that vampire man Gregory isn’t it
he’s like a vampire isn’t he And
I knew there’d be a fuss

She turns to Maria with the necklace hanging

DIANA (CONTD)
They are beautiful It’s not the
pearl’s fault is it

MARIA
No Ma’am

Diana takes the necklace off and holds out the string of
pearls

DIANA
If I gave them to you would you
take them

Maria is astonished horrified
MARIA
No No I couldn’t possibly think
of it Ma’am

Diana nods

DIANA
No of course not Cursed Sorry

She hooks her hand around the pearl necklace

DIANA (CONTD)
I’m told there is a dress to go
with them I’m told it’s all set
You know All set As if everything
has already happened

A pause Diana takes a breath

DIANA (CONTD)
Sorry Do carry on

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 24

Diana turns to leave then stops

DIANA (CONTD)
Oh do you know which room theyve
put me in Is it the same one

A pause

MARIA
No I think this year they have
drawn a new map

Diana nods and smiles

DIANA
Of course Everything is different
this year

INT SANDRINGHAM DIANA’S ROOM - NIGHT 24

A stately room looking out over the grounds Through a
billowing net curtain we see the scarecrow standing as a
small speck on the brow of a hill

The scarecrows jacket is now on a hanger near the window of
the room

In the middle of the room there is the clothes rack on wheels
and on it are hung a dozen beautiful elegant dresses Each
dress is labelled with a large label that is hand written

Diana enters and stops when she sees the dresses She half
smiles at some weary burden In silence she goes to the
scarecrow jacket and sees that a tear in the sleeve has
already been sewn up

She leaves her hand on the shoulder of the jacket for a
moment

She then sees that a hardback book has been left on the
bedside table as if for her to read She goes to it and we
see that it is ‘THE RISE AND FALL OF ANNE BOLEYN’ Diana
reacts puzzled as to why the book would be there There is
just one gap in the tightly packed bookshelf She looks back
to the book and studies the mournful portrait of Anne Boleyn
on the cover (we will see her again)

She flicks the pages and we see more portraits of Anne and of
Henry VIII She glances up at her father’s jacket on the
hanger and speaks to it as if it were the most natural
thing
Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 25

DIANA
Papa Didn’t you tell me once that
we Spencers are distantly related
to Anne Boleyn

She flicks through the pages and comes to the Holbein
portrait of Henry VIII looking indomitable

DIANA (CONTD)
When you told me I read all about
her

She glances at the jacket then turns back to the portrait of
Anne Boleyn Anne stares out mournfully

DIANA (CONTD)
I even wrote a poem

She playfully recites a little couplet

DIANA (CONTD)
‘She married the King of England

She looks around the room

DIANA (CONTD)
‘And the King chopped off her

head’
A pause
DIANA (CONTD)
“Because he’d met another woman
and wanted her to be Queen
A pause

DIANA (CONTD)
‘Instead’

She quickly closes the book and stands up and goes to the
clothes rack (the book will play later)

She begins to lay the dresses on the bed We come close and
as she lays the dresses out in a line (time cut) we glide
across the labels and read them

The labels read ‘Diana POW Christmas Eve dinner’ The
next ‘Diana POW Christmas day breakfast’ Then ‘Diana POW
first Church service’ Then ‘Christmas day lunch’ The
labels continue to cover the next fifteen meals teas high
teas lunches suppers all the way to ‘Boxing day Shoot
supper’ The last dress has the label ‘Diana POW Dress
for going home’
Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021

Diana surveys the dresses then picks up the dress labelled
Christmas Eve dinner She holds it to her body and studies
herself in the mirror The dress is ivory coloured meant to
work with the pearls

Diana begins to undress and soon she is in her underwear
She stares at herself in the mirror and turns around the
pearls hanging heavy on her neck There is a knock at the
door

DIANA (CONTD)
Who is it

MAGGIE (OOV)
It’s Maggie Ma’am

Diana looks relieved

DIANA
Come Emergency

The door opens and Maggie enters Diana is studying herself
in the mirror with the dress held up and the pearls hanging
We will learn Diana and Maggie were once close now half
estranged They slip back bit-by-bit into an old
familiarity

DIANA (CONTD)
Oh God thank God it’s you Look

Maggie gets to business straight away and checks the
reflection

MAGGIE
Emergency Why It looks
beautiful

DIANA
It doesn’t fit

MAGGIE
Have you tried it on

DIANA
No With my mood It doesn’t fit
with my mood It should be black
Black to contrast the pearls

Maggie reacts and glances with some alarm at the scarecrow
jacket silhouetted in the window (already a symptom of
oddness) Diana sees and smiles

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021

DIANA (CONTD)
Not only did I rescue it froma
scarecrow I am talking to it All
rumors of my disintegration
confirmed

Diana holds the dress against her body

DIANA (CONTD)
You know the dust in this house
almost certainly has the dead skin
of every person who ever stayed
here in it This was once Queen
Victoria’s room So it will have
her skin floating in the air She
wore black for forty years after
her husband died That’s love
isn’t it

A pause Maggie wants normality

MAGGIE
Well there’s no need to wear black
because no one has died

DIANA
By the way thanks for mending the
coat I’m going to give it back to
my dad He’ll think it’s funny

Diana lets the ivory dress drop Her hands shake a little
Maggie takes her hands gently

MAGGIE
In London you thought ivory would
be good for Christmas Eve

DIANA
That was London This is 1847

MAGGIE
It’s marvellous with the pearls

DIANA
Yes marvellous

MAGGIE
Just try it on Go on

Diana gives silent permission Maggie begins the business of
helping Diana put on the dress The zip glides up her back

DIANA
Sorry I’ve put on weight
Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 28

MAGGIE
No Youve lost weight There’s up
and there’s down It’s not an issue
of debate Remember we used to
talk

Diana turns to examine herself in the dress in the
reflection She voices her despair brightly

DIANA
They fill your eggs with Princes
then ride away But you know that’s
fine Just fine Fuck it I will
wear the pearls and the dress

MAGGIE
Good Good choice

DIANA
Because I’m too weak to insist on
black

MAGGIE
Please it will be fine

DIANA
Oh good It will be fine You will
be in the world in some pub
laughing I will be in the middle
of a field full of fucking
landmines Diana POW ‘Prisoner
Of War’

Maggie peers at her edging back to old issues

MAGGIE
So stand very still and smile a
lot

Diana and Maggie share a moment Diana gestures for Maggie to
take off the dress and she unzips

DIANA
Maggie remember in those days when
we used to talk it was all new
Now here we are talking as if you
were the maid

Maggie takes the dress and hangs it as if it were precious
MAGGIE

In this house everyone can hear
everything
Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 29

DIANA
Even your thoughts Who is that
new chap He reads your

thoughts

MAGGIE
Yes they are getting quite
serious

DIANA

About what

A pause Maggie steps back further into their former

intimacy

MAGGIE
They are getting serious about you

Maggie confronts her reaction

MAGGIE (CONTD)
It is concern

DIANA
Concern Yes Suggesting
compassion Why wouldn’t they be
concerned I’m half gone

MAGGIE
Gone where

DIANA
I don’t know Today I almost kept
driving

Diana runs her hand along the line of dresses as she walks by
them (as she talks she repeats the lie she said she wouldn’t

tell)

DIANA (CONTD)
-l was late I told them it was a
broken down tractor but it was a
lie You know why they have put me
in this room Because they say it
is haunted

MAGGIE
Ma’‘am please

DIANA
By the sadness of loss Last year I
was in a different part of the
house This is the part where they
might hide a lunatic
Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 30

Maggie suddenly grabs Diana’s hands again and this time looks
fiercely into her eyes (at last they are back) She speaks as
if fearing she will be overheard

MAGGIE
Remember the project At the
beginning The idea Change You
would change them Me and Hooper
and Clarke and all the old
Kensington clan Chip away at
them Break a bit of China

DIANA
I broke a lot of China And they
just sweep it up Endlessly This
year they insisted I get weighed
A bit of fun

MAGGIE
They can’t change YOU have to
change

Silence Diana looks at her Maggie hesitates

MAGGIE (CONTD)
I meanthe weighing Yes That
is just that just a bit of fun
Don’t see conspiracy everywhere
Dont behave the way they say you
behave you make it easy for them

DIANA
Easy for them to do what

Maggie stands beside Diana as they look in the mirror

MAGGIE
Just look gorgeous I know about
the pearls I know he gave the same
to her I understand why you are
like this

DIANA
It’s deliberate

MAGGIE
No He just forgets But wear them
anyway And in your beauty he will
remember In your beauty

DIANA
I don’t care if he fucking
remembers
Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 31

MAGGIE
Then only remember you are
beautiful Don’t let that go

Diana turns from the mirror She removes her bra and her
underwear She stands naked in front of Maggie

DIANA
Still

MAGGIE
If you took off your skin and bones
you would still be beautiful

DIANA
Beauty is useless Beauty is
clothing
MAGGIE
People dream of being you having
your life Living in a palace
DIANA
They dream but they are able to
wake up I am not allowed to wake
up
MAGGIE
In this house you have to whisper

She takes Diana’s hand again

MAGGIE (CONTD)
But you should know that even in
this house there are voices in your
favor In the kitchens in the
store rooms under the stairs

DIANA
You mean the mice like me

MAGGIE
Remember the family are just as
confused and bewildered as you are
they have just had a thousand years
of it The mice are on your side
The people are on your side You
are the most famous woman on earth

They look at each other
DIANA

Yes but famous for what For doing
this

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 32

Diana affects her classic shy behind the fringe pose and
almost smiles

MAGGIE
Now Good Almost the old smile
Are the other dresses to your
satisfaction

Diana pulls on a robe

DIANA
No I want to attend Christmas
dinner dressed as a pole dancer

Maggie takes the change of gear without a flicker and goes
with it

MAGGIE
Pole dancer Yes Of course Your
Royal Highness 1I’11 pop into the
village

They both hide smiles After a moment

MAGGIE (CONTD)
What we wanted to do is still
possible They will run out of
China to break eventually

Diana has a momentarily fierce expression

DIANA
Stay close to me Maggie

INT SANDRINGHAM KITCHEN - NIGHT 25

A frantic service is in operation with a five course meal
being prepared We come close to knives chopping and slicing
raw meat a beef dish to be encased in pastry

Ducks hang from hooks and steam and flame choke the air
Darren hisses

DARREN
Prepare the tureens warm the
bowls

A chef (incidentally in the background) falls in a crash of
plates and glass

DARREN (CONTD)
--hush Hush No noise They can
hear us Stay on your feet

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 33

The chef gets to her feet and the mess is mopped quickly
through the steam and smoke

DARREN (CONTD)
Pitter patter soft words fingers
out of the sauces you sons and
daughters of bitches and blanch the
nettles or they will sting you
Brigade make everything the best
it can be

A pause He speaks certainly but quietly

DARREN (CONTD)
I want the Princess of Wales to
want something

The chefs and porters glance at each other and it appears the
mentioning of the Princess of Wales is a call to arms
Darren sips some soup and speaks softly

DARREN (CONTD)
Service

EXTINT SANDRINGHAM DINING ROOM FROM OUTSIDE - NIGHT 26

Through a leaded window as if from a point of view outside

we see the entire Royal Family (except the children) sitting

down at the long Sandringham dinner table Rain dribbles down
the window between us and them The figures at the table are
a blur in candlelight as dishes are served by liveried staff
But we can easily see Diana in the ivory coloured dress which
stands out in the gloom The conversation is just a buzz of

voices through the window

INT SANDRINGHAM DINING ROOM - NIGHT 27

-We come inside and come close to Diana We see the man we
will learn is PRINCE CHARLES and the woman we will learn is
THE QUEEN and beyond the QUEEN MOTHER but in the candle
light they are colours and sparkling jewels NOT IN FOCUS

Diana is isolated by our gaze and the nature of our gaze as
if we were her only companion

Diana dips her spoon into her bowl of green nettle soup and
takes a sip Other spoons dip into other bowls Diana looks
along the line of other Royals She sits back in her chair
and puts her spoon down

Suddenly elegant Waltz music begins

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 34

Soon all of the spoons are dipping into the soup in unison
in time to the swooping Waltz music The spoons dip swirl
and then are lifted to mouths where the soup is sucked in
unison The footmen move in time to the music

Diana puts her hand to her mouth and stifles a giggle The
Waltz and the sipping continues for a while Then

Suddenly the music stops We see Charles properly for the

first time in sharp ferocious focus He stares murder at
Diana as she giggles apparently at nothing She glances at

him and then looks down into her soup

The music begins again and Diana is isolated as she stifles a
giggle again and the spoons dip and rise to the time of the
music Then Diana looks up and takes hold of her pearl
necklace She grips it and pulls it hard like wringing a
neck

One-by-one the pearls plop off their string and fall into her
soup some in slow motion as the Waltz music plays

The white pearls splash beautifully into the green soup
Then Diana swirls the pearls into the soup with her spoon
Then she scoops up two pearls in her spoon and puts them to
her mouth She looks to Charles as she puts the pearls into
her mouth and then swallows them

INT SANDRINGHAM BATHROOM GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT 28

-We come to Diana as she throws up violently into the
lavatory As she retches we might notice the pearl necklace
is still in one piece (what went before was imagined)

However the vomiting is real and violent and messy

Diana’s hair hangs in sweaty rat tails and some dip into the
bowl She coughs up some more greenish vomit and then sits
back against the wall With shaking hands she grips the
pearl necklace She hisses to herself

DIANA
Not strong enough to do it for
real

She twists it around her neck like a noose Then she looks
up at the ceiling and smiles

DIANA (CONTD)
I didn’t fucking ask for this I
didn’t ask for her pearls in my
fucking soup I didn’t actually ask
for

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 35

A hard knock at the door A female voice no identity

MARIA (OOV)
Ma’am it’s dessert They are
waiting for you

Diana takes a breath and gets to her feet like a new born
foal

INT SANDRINGHAM DIANA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 29

1980s pop songs are playing as Diana pulls off her ivory
dress screws it up and throws it

DIANA
One down a hundred million to go

She walks to her father’s jacket which she took from the
scarecrow and places the pearl necklace around the collar

DIANA (CONTD)
Look what he gave me

Then we time cut as she pulls on a pair of jeans anda
sweater as the music plays She almost dances into the
clothes She is in the fitful high peak of the depression
landscape and sings along to the music She looks at herself
in the mirror

DIANA (CONTD)
So good of you to come old girl
Fucking famished Let’s do it

Diana picks up a SONY WALKMAN and puts on the headphones
She leaves and we hear the music in her head along with her
INT SANDRINGHAM CORRIDOR GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT 30
She walks down the silent corridor with music blaring in her
head As she passes a particular corridor we see Major

Gregory in a reflection

Major Gregory sees her pass and follows

INT SANDRINGHAM KITCHEN - NIGHT 31

Diana is wearing the headphones and has her head in the
fridge She pulls out a chicken leg and begins to devour it
Major Gregory enters and stares at her Because of the
headphones Diana doesn’t hear him
Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 36

She turns and almost jumps out of her skin She coughs on
the chicken and instinctively puts the chicken leg into her
pocket She tugs off her headphones

MAJOR GREGORY
Still hungry Ma’am

Diana decides to defy She sits up on a work surface and eats
with legs dangling

DIANA
Exactly who are you

MAJOR GREGORY
I’m usually at Clarence House
Drafted in for this occasion I am
the Queen Mother’s equerry

DIANA
What were you before that

MAJOR GREGORY
I was an officer In a regiment
called the Black Watch

DIANA
And that’s what you do You watch

She puts the chicken bone aside on the surface

MAJOR GREGORY
Mostly I am here because of the
press

Major Gregory walks to the surface picks up the chicken bone
(with some distaste) and puts it into the bin

MAJOR GREGORY (CONTD)
It was felt we needed to be on
guard this year Because of all the
silly attention

He glances at her

MAJOR GREGORY (CONTD)
That Your Royal Highness is
attracting

DIANA
Yes I am a magnet for madness
Other people’s madness
Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021

MAJOR GREGORY
I have military experience And
part of my remit is responsibility
for the security within the grounds
of Sandringham House To keep
photographers away Foreigners
You know

Diana nods

MAJOR GREGORY (CONTD)
For example Ma’am one of them
reported back today he saw you
dressing and undressing with your
curtains open

Diana freezes

MAJOR GREGORY (CONTD)
If there had been a photographer

DIANA
My God you really watch

MAJOR GREGORY
I watch to make sure others do not
see Their lenses are terribly
powerful these days

DIANA
Their lenses are more like
microscopes actually

Diana drifts to the window and peers out at the blackness
She sees her reflection

DIANA (CONTD)
And I am the bug in the dish They
are pulling my wings and my legs
off one-by-one and making notes on
how I react ‘Oh she really does
make a fuss this one doesn’t she’
Not like Anne Boleyn Who offered
her head to the tweezers with such
grace

Diana realises her inner life is spilling out She turns to
Major Gregory

DIANA (CONTD)
Will you go away please

Major Gregory defies for a moment

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021

MAJOR GREGORY
I just wanted to be sure you were
feeling alright And give you that
word of warning

DIANA
I will feel alright if you go away

Major Gregory bows gently

MAJOR GREGORY
Very well But please keep your
curtains

DIANA
Close my curtains Yes maybe no
Depending on lots of things

He studies her feels he has the better of her

MAJOR GREGORY
Good night Ma’am Oh and

He checks his watch

MAJOR GREGORY (CONTD)
It’s just gone midnight Merry
Christmas

Diana always surrenders in face of form She replies
instinctively

DIANA
Oh yes Merry Christmas

Major Gregory leaves Diana is left alone She goes back to
the fridge and takes out a slice of cake which she eats with
both hands She licks her fingers clean

As she licks her fingers she realises she is sucking on her
wedding ring The cream of the cake make it easy for her to
slip the ring off her finger and she puts it into her mouth
After a moment she spits it out into the palm of her hand

DIANA (CONTD)

If you don’t want it why did you
ask for it

EXT SANDRINGHAM GROUNDS - DEAD OF NIGHT 33

We see Diana making her way across frosted moonlit ground
away from the house where lights still burn

She shivers in the freezing night air and her steps make
footprints in the frost She climbs over a small fence and
jumps a ditch with frozen water Owls hoot She gets
glistening mud on her hands

As she reaches the top of a small rise she and we see a
country house large by normal proportions but small compared
to Sandringham

This is PARK HOUSE where Diana grew up

She stops and looks and her breath clouds We study her face
as she stares In the moonlight we see that the windows are
boarded up It is like memory facing her but with eyes
closed Diana wipes her nose with her sleeve like a child
and walks on

EXT PARK HOUSE —- DEAD OF NIGHT 34

Diana reaches a wire fence and sees a sign ‘Dangerous
construction Keep out’ She pulls a gap in the barbed wire
and squeezes through A barb catches her coat and she gets
snagged but pulls herself free She cuts her hand on another
barb and when she gets through she stops to suck the blood

Ahead is another barbed wire fence this time too complex to
climb through She stops and stares through the wire

She suddenly sees that one of the windows is not boarded
Through open curtains she sees DIANA 12YRS staring out
dressed in a nightdress framed by a bedside lamp Diana
reacts and smiles She whispers to her young self

DIANA
Christmas Eve Can’t sleep
Wondering what will become of me

A pause Diana fights emotion

DIANA (CONTD)
Well here I am Here it is This
is what became of me Couldn’t have
asked for more Got everything I
ever wanted

Suddenly a male voice loud and harsh
Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021

POLICE CONSTABLE THOMAS
Who goes there

Diana gasps and turns In the moonlight she sees two men in
black uniforms with pistols raised guns held in both hands
An intense flashlight is then trained on her

POLICE CONSTABLE THOMAS (CONTD)
Hands on your head Move Move

Diana instantly puts her hands onto her head shivering with
cold The flashlight blinds her The two armed police
constables move forward slowly shining the light on Diana’s
face

DIANA
Sorry It’s me

The policemen realise it is a woman Then as they come
closer and Diana turns her head into the light they see who
it is

POLICE CONSTABLE THOMAS
Holy shhhh

They lower their guns fast

POLICE CONSTABLE THOMAS (CONTD)
Your Royal Highness Apologies
We thought you were

DIANA
Can I take my hands off my head

POLICE CONSTABLE THOMAS
Of course Sorry ma’am

Diana lowers her hands and turns back to Park House We see
that the window she looked through is now boarded (it was an
illusion)

DIANA
I imagine you’re wondering what I’m
doing here

Incredulous silence confirms She points and smiles

DIANA (CONTD)
I used to live there I grew up
there I came to take a look That
was my bedroom

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 41

The constables are at a loss as to how to behave Diana
realises and to put them at ease slips into royal-visit small
talk

DIANA (CONTD)
Do they make you stay out all
night

POLICE CONSTABLE FIELD
Yes Ma’am

DIANA
I hope you have proper you know

POLICE CONSTABLE FIELD
We have warm clothes yes

POLICE CONSTABLE THOMAS
Thank you We’re OK Ma’am

An awkward pause

DIANA
I once stayed out all night and
built a fire Just here on this
spot They say there are a lot of
ghosts I wanted to see one

A pause The officers glance at each other

POLICE CONSTABLE FIELD
Ma’am according to the rules if
we have an encounter we have to
report it

DIANA
An encounter with a ghost

POLICE CONSTABLE FIELD
No with a

A pause

POLICE CONSTABLE FIELD (CONTD)
-With anyone A human

Diana laughs then looks back to the house

DIANA
I’m human I think Still human
But I’d like it if you didn’t
report this encounter
Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021

She turns to them and hooks her hair behind her ear and
shivers profoundly She looks thin and pale and lost

DIANA (CONTD)
Just say you saw a ghost

POLICE CONSTABLE THOMAS
Are you warm enough ma’am

Diana looks back at the house

DIANA
Not really They won’t turn the
heating up

The constables glance at each other sensing her oddness
distracted mood She turns to them

DIANA (CONTD)
I’1l go back

POLICE CONSTABLE FIELD
We will escort you

DIANA
Why

POLICE CONSTABLE FIELD
There are photographers

DIANA
Perhaps they just want to take
pictures of what’s really going on

A pause The constables are silent
DIANA (CONTD)

Sorry I like to walk alone I’m
fine really

her

As she turns one of the constable’s radios crackles and he
answers it He hears a question and hesitates as he looks at

Diana who has stopped to listen

POLICE CONSTABLE THOMAS
No It was nothing No one All
clear A fox Walking on a wall
Casting a shadow

He cuts the communication Diana smiles
DIANA

A fox walking on a wall casting a
shadow Yes That is who I am

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021

Diana turns and walks

INT SANDRINGHAM CORRIDOR UPSTAIRS - DEAD OF NIGHT 35

Diana walks quickly She reaches the door to the nursery and
tries to open it but the door is locked The Nanny Barbara
suddenly appears in Diana’s back

BARBARA

DIANA
Why is this locked

BARBARA

DIANA
Unlock it Now I mean please

Barbara stands and unlocks the door with shaking just woken
hands Diana goes in

INT SANDRINGHAM WILLIAM AND HARRYS BEDROOMNURSERY 36

Both boys are sleeping but Diana gets straight into bed with
William William stirs instantly and blinks then reacts

WILLIAM

She giggles

DIANA
I tried to escape and got captured

William comes to consciousness and peers at her across the
pillow Then from under her coat Diana produces a small
wrapped gift She holds it close to William under the
sheets

DIANA (CONTD)
One for you

She produces another small wrapped gift in her other hand

DIANA (CONTD)
One for Harry

WILLIAM

HARRY (OOV)

Diana giggles as Harry sits up hair awry blinking

HARRY (CONTD)

DIANA
Come come come come

Harry hurries to join William and Diana and they huddle
together

DIANA (CONTD)
If you’re cold you light a fire

WILLIAM
Mummy they boarded up the
fireplace

Diana gets to her feet and goes to the fireplace and finds a
candle There is a small box of matches beside it She
lights the candle and shields it as she walks toward William
and Harry

DIANA
Do I look scary

WILLIAM
No

HARRY
I’m hungry

Diana remembers and pulls the chicken leg she stole from the
fridge out of her pocket

WILLIAM
Mummy how do you do that I mean

Diana takes the chicken leg and begins to meticulously remove

pocket fluff from the chicken like a careful mother
does

DIANA
OK I will be the Major and you

Harry begins to growl like a dinosaur as he plays with the
toy

WILLIAM (CONTD)
Mum I asked you a question

DIANA
Nothing has happened that hasnt
happened before I got a necklace
to put around my neck she got the
blade of an axe

WILLIAM
Who

Silence

WILLIAM (CONTD)
Mum I heard a maid talking

DIANA
That is what maids do they talk

HARRY
Brontosaurus pounces

WILLIAM
What is this other woman’s name

HARRY
Brontosaurus kills

Diana blinks quickly to hide tears then blows out the candle

DIANA
Major Diana to her two little
soldiers Go to sleep

They are now in half darkness Diana gets out of bed

HARRY
Mummy stay

DIANA
Not allowed

She whispers to William

DIANA (CONTD)
If I start being really silly in
the next two days just tell me
Ill only believe it if it’s you
who tells me

Diana walks

DIANA (CONTD)
Merry Christmas my gorgeous boys

INT SANDRINGHAM DIANAS BATHROOM - MORNING 37

We can just make out a figure in the shower reflected ina
full length mirror The figure stands dead still under the
cascade of water

Caption Christmas morning

The door opens and billows a cloud of steam Diana looks
down and sees the legs of a woman fifty pounds heavier The
image of the heavier legs is almost lost in the steam and
Diana grabs a robe She comes to stand in the mirror with
dripping hair The mirror steams up instantly and Diana
stares at herself She then leans forward and wipes a hole in
the mist

We see the misted reflection as ‘Diana’ removes her robe and
studies her profile in the mist a woman fifty pounds heavier
than the Diana we know just a shape in the condensation

There is a loud knock at the door Diana - real Diana this
time - waits a moment then grabs her robe

INT SANDRINGHAM DIANA’S BEDROOM - MORNING 38

Diana enters in her robe her hair still wet (We might
notice that the Anne Boleyn book is now open face down on the
bed She has begun to read it) She goes to the door

DIANA
Who is it
Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021

VOICE
Your dresser Your Royal Highness

Diana is puzzled and unlocks and opens the door She finds a
middle-aged woman curtseying (DRESSER ANGELA) Diana stands
in the doorway

DIANA
Where is Maggie

Diana reacts She looks around the room behind her paranoid
as if someone must have heard her exchange with Maggie

ANGELA
I’ve dressed you before Ma’am

DIANA
Yes I know

ANGELA
May I come in

DIANA
Where is Maggie

ANGELA
I believe Mr Gregory sent her back
to London

Diana stands aside Angela hesitates then enters She goes
to a cupboard where all of Diana’s dresses for each meal and
event are now hanging She picks the one labelled ‘Diana
POW Christmas morning’

She holds it up to the light then lays it on the bed She
then goes to the curtains (which Diana left open) and closes
them Diana studies her with silent resentment (though the
dresser is bright and nervous)

ANGELA (CONTD)
Very cold this morning

Diana watches her close the other curtains
ANGELA (CONTD)
The next outfit the one you chose
for church I suggest you match
with the warm Morino long coat

Diana cuts in

DIANA
How do I look

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 50
Angela stops and turns and looks at Diana in her robe and her
wet hair

ANGELA
What do you mean

Diana looks at her

DIANA
Right now How do I look

ANGELA (CONFUSED)
Very nice

Diana nods gently

DIANA
Merry Christmas

Angela is more confused but replies instinctively

ANGELA

Oh yes Merry Christmas Ma’am
DIANA

‘Very nice’ ‘Merry Christmas’
ANGELA

Sorry ma’am

DIANA
I really would like to have someone
to talk to properly When is Maggie
back

ANGELA
I really don’t know Ma’am

DIANA
That will be all Thank you

ANGELA
I’m sorry

DIANA
There is a designated dress which I
will put on for breakfast I can
put it on myself

ANGELA
Your hair is wet
Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 51

DIANA
Tell them I want Maggie Tell Major
Gregory who hears everything that I
insist on having Maggie

Angela is now deeply puzzled

ANGELA
It isn’t really Major Gregory who
decides

DIANA

No he doesn’t decide There is
never a decision to make There is
only what must happen

Silence

DIANA (CONTD)
But even so tell them I insist on
having Maggie

Angela looks eager to leave

DIANA (CONTD)
Or I will cut all my dresses to
pieces with a kitchen knife

Angela smothers her reaction She curtseys again and walks
Diana speaks quickly before she reaches the door

DIANA (CONTD)
Of course don’t say that I don’t
mean that don’t say that just say
that I would like Maggie though
you are good I would prefer I
would like Maggie

Angela stops and allows her concern to show

ANGELA
Yes Ma’am

Diana waits for her to leave then curses herself knowing
every word will be reported back She goes to the curtains
and is about to throw them open but doesn’t

She makes a small gap and peers out at the drizzle We are
close as she makes a decision

She goes back to the bed and picks up the dress allocated for
Christmas morning breakfast then drops it on the floor She
then goes to the wardrobe and scans the rails She finds the
dress designated for Boxing day morning breakfast

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021
She unhooks it from the rail

INT SANDRINGHAM BREAKFAST ROOM —- DAY 39

All the family are gathered at the breakfast table We
hardly dwell on them but instead focus on Major Gregory who
is reading aloud from the set breakfast menu

MAJOR GREGORY
-followed by coddled eggs with
cream sauce then Scottish kippers
with brown and white

Diana enters with a whispered apology She is wearing THE
WRONG DRESS and is unsure if the heavens will cave in

MAJOR GREGORY (CONTD)
Brown and white toast This
will be accompanied by simmered
herring roes toasted muffins and
quince jelly

Diana stands for a while to make sure the dress has been
seen to check the reaction There is none Major Gregory
continues as she takes her seat

MAJOR GREGORY (CONTD)
-This will be followed by fresh
coffee with a selection of organic
pastries and cakes from Highgrove
House

Diana is next to Charles who nods and smiles at Major
Gregory on mention of Highgrove organic products

MAJOR GREGORY (CONTD)
-A selection of organic Highgrove
jams and marmalade with honey from
Highgrove bees

A pause

MAJOR GREGORY (CONTD)
Followed by tea

He glances at Diana when he emphasizes the time

MAJOR GREGORY (CONTD)
Then at ten o’clock precisely cars
will take all concerned to St Mary
Magdalene church for the
traditional morning worship

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021

Major Gregory bows to the Queen (lost in rays of sunlight
from the windows)

MAJOR GREGORY (CONTD)
But now I leave you to your
breakfast Your Majesty

Major Gregory leaves A page and two footmen then enter
carrying steaming dishes of food racks of toast plates of
eggs In the clatter Diana speaks softly to Charles to test
her rebellion

DIANA
How do I look

He glances at her without seeing

CHARLES
You look fine

He looks away as a footman comes between them and places a
rack of toast Diana smiles to herself having apparently
gotten away with her tiny gesture The footman then moves
away and they are reunited As Charles reaches for the
toast he speaks breezily without turning

CHARLES (CONTD)
There is one thing

Diana waits

CHARLES (CONTD)
The chickens laid the eggs the
fishermen caught the fish the bees
made the honey They all made such
an effort to bring you breakfast
Please do them the courtesy of not
regurgitating it all into a
lavatory bowl before the church
bells even ring

The words chase Diana’s smile from her face as the rest of
the family sit back and have their breakfast served to them
with small utterances of pleasure

INT ST MARY MAGDALENE CHURCH —- DAY 40

Church bells ring The beautiful rural church is decked for
Christmas Certain invited local people are in the pews and
heads turn as the doors open An organ begins to play the
National Anthem and the congregation all stand
Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 54

We see the Royal family enter We let the others pass and we
enter with Diana who is wearing a long green dress She is
holding hands with William and Harry and they make progress
up the aisle

We should notice that ALL eyes are on Diana and the children
and we might notice a twitch of irritation on Charles who
walks with them

Diana and the children enter a pew second from the front
Diana looks up to the altar William takes his chance and
whispers

WILLIAM
Thanks for the pencil case It’s
awful
DIANA
I got it from a petrol station

Diana giggles

DIANA (CONTD)
It’s Christmas It’s the thought
that counts Did you tell anyone

WILLIAM
No I told Harry to hide his
dinosaur but he’s lost it anyway

Diana smiles and looks up Charles arrives and stands a
little way away along the same pew As he settles he
glances back across the aisle

We see a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN catch Charles’s eye for just a
second before Charles looks back to the font We should know
just from this one look who it is that Charles looked to
CAMILLA will never be mentioned in this story and we will
only see her in this fleeting moment

Diana looks at Camilla Camilla stares back impassive and
knowing Diana looks down and reacts

William has seen the whole thing He realizes and lowers his
head too

We come close to Diana’s face her resolve not to be hurt
perhaps we even see that she is numb William notices

WILLIAM (CONTD)
Mummy It will be OK

Diana whispers

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 55

DIANA
Two wives is better than six wives
yes

She looks back to the altar The Vicar speaks

VICAR
Please rise and sing our first
hymn ‘Hark the Herald Angels
sing’

The organ fires up and the congregation begin to sing We
come close to Diana as she begins to sing uncertainly

EXT ST MARY MAGDALENE CHURCH - LATER 4l

The bells are pealing as the family emerge There is a huge
gathering of photographers as well as members of the public
As the Royals appear the cameras turn almost in unison on
Diana The people and the photographers call her name out
loud Diana Diana

As the cameras begin to click we see Diana’s turmoil Every
click hurts her but she is also aware that the rest of the
family are uneasy that she is taking all the attention

She knows in this moment that she has power She really is
the most famous woman in the world

Diana breaks free from Charles and approaches the crowd of
well wishers She flicks her hair and smiles her dazzling
smile and the cameras go wild

She deliberately throws open her overcoat to reveal the
‘wrong’ green dress We come close to Charles and the others
who glance in her direction

There is nothing overt but we should feel the power of Diana
and the way it unbalances the family dynamic in this most
traditional of moments

A well wisher calls out

WELL WISHER
How is your Christmas Your Royal
Highness

She smiles We see Charles again he’s uneasy We read in
his expression how power has shifted

DIANA
It’s all about family really isn’t
it

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 56

Suddenly

INT SANDRINGHAM KITCHEN STORE ROOM - DAY 42

On the soundtrack we still hear the church congregation
singing

Major Gregory and a maid having sex

The store room is the room temperature pantry for meat
Sides of lamb and venison carcasses hang along with rabbits
in their skins

Major Gregory is leaning over RUBY a kitchen maid in her mid
forties who has her back turned to him and is leaning over a
surface Gregory is stroking her hair and whispering

MAJOR GREGORY
Now Where’s Major Gregorys
Christmas present

She laughs

RUBY
Be quick for God’s sake

MAJOR GREGORY
They’re all at church This is our
time I’ve missed you since they
stole you from me

Out of shot he lifts her skirt from behind Then there is a
knock at the locked door We hear Angela the dresser

ANGELA (OOV)
Major Gregory

MAJOR GREGORY
Fuck Please can you wait

ANGELA
It’s on the news Right now

Major Gregory curses
MAJOR GREGORY
What is
INT SANDRINGHAM STAFF CANTEEN - DAY 43

A TV hangs above two functional canteen tables in the staff
area of Sandringham
Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021

We find Major Gregory and Angela amongst some members of the
downstairs staff peering up at the BBC news coverage of the
Royal family leaving St Mary Magdalene church

We reprise the scenes we saw outside the church this time
from the point of view of a TV camera We see Diana reveal
her green dress under her heavy winter coat

The BBC announcer is speaking

ANNOUNCER (OOV)
The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh
today attended St Mary Magdalene
church in Sandringham for the
traditional Christmas morning
service

A TV camera singles out Diana We come around on Major
Gregory and Angela

ANGELA
Look she’s wearing the wrong one

ANNOUNCER (OOV)
The sixteenth century church has
been attended by royalty since
Queen Victoria first worshipped
here

ANGELA
She’s wearing ‘Boxing day
breakfast’ when it should be
‘Christmas day church’

ANNOUNCER (OOV)
Diana seemed to be happy and
relaxed as she chatted with well
wishers with no suggestion of the
difficulties which have been
recently reported

We see Diana smiling and shaking hands with a solemn seven
year old boy she turns and gives a perfect smile for the
cameras

ANNOUNCER (CONTD)
» She was looking stunning as
always for the cameras

We see Major Gregory puzzled

ANNOUNCER (CONTD)
The family later returned to
Sandringham for lunch

(MORE)

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 58

ANNOUNCER (CONTD)
This afternoon at three o’clock
Her Majesty The Queen will make her
traditional address to the nation
and it is understood this year’s
message will be about the
importance of freedom

Major Gregory turns off the TV Angela is fretting

ANGELA
Does it matter that she’s swapping
them around I mean should I tell
anyone They might think it’s me
making mistakes

Major Gregory takes a breath and his face hardens as he
stares at the blank screen

MAJOR GREGORY
Don’t worry They’ll know it’s not
you who is making mistakes

INT SANDRINGHAM DIANAS BEDROOM - DAY 44

Diana is lying on the bed in half light with the curtains
closed but billowing in breeze The wardrobe is open and her
array of dresses and coats are visible inside She is lying
with eyes closed and with the overcoat she wore to church
over her against the cold

On the bedside table face down and open at a certain page
we see the book ‘Life and death of Anne Boleyn’ It is half
read

There is a knock at the door Yet another urgent footman

FOOTMAN BRIAN (OOV)
Ma’am Lunch is served

A pause Eyes closed

DIANA
Yes Coming

Another knock

FOOTMAN BRIAN (OOV)
They are all waiting

DIANA (BRIGHTLY EYES CLOSED)
Yes I’m coming
Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 59

Then we hear the sound of a shotgun being fired outside She
opens her eyes gets up and goes to the curtains

She is about to pull them open but another blast of a shotgun
from outside makes her hesitate and step back She reaches
out to part the curtains but in the half light she hears a
whispered woman’s voice

ANNE BOLEYN
Oh death rock me to sleep

Diana turns sharply In the shadows we see a woman’s face
her hair hanging loose a dark smoky robe a hand and an arm
with white skin sticking out of the darkness It is hard to
make out but we see it is the half hidden face of Anne
Boleyn

Diana shrieks

And then wakes up for real

We should realise what went before was a dream from which she
has woken

Diana sits up and looks around The curtains are closed and
the room is as we saw it in the dream and outside there are
indeed shotgun blasts The book is beside the bed She sits
up and gathers herself Another shotgun blast

She stares at her rack of clothes and repeats the words of
the vision softly

DIANA
‘Oh death rock me to sleep’

Diana appears to recognise the words She looks around the
room still not sure it was entirely a dream She picks up
the Anne Boleyn book and quickly leafs through the pages to
find a particular page and quote

Outside another shotgun blast Diana finds the page and
reads aloud

DIANA (CONTD)
‘Oh death rock me to sleep Bring
me to quiet rest let pass my weary
guiltless ghost out of my careful
breast’

Diana takes a few breaths and looks at the wardrobe and the
dresses where the vision disappeared in her dream She
repeats

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 60

DIANA (CONTD)
My guiltless ghost

Another blast of a shotgun

Diana puts the book down and turns to the curtains This
time she yanks them open and daylight floods in at last She
looks out and sees two figures with shotguns

Suddenly

EXT SANDRINGHAM GROUNDS - DAY 45
A shotgun is fired close up both barrels

We find the source of the shotgun blasts Charles is
standing in a field with his gun his private valet Michael
and a clay pigeon operator We can see the scarecrow on a
distant hill looking down

CHARLES
Pull

A remote control button on a wire is pressed and a clay
pigeon is sent flying through the air from the sling shot
machine Charles takes aim and shoots Charles is wearing
protective spectacles and earphones He fires and the clay
is smashed

We pull wider to see that William is standing beside Charles
He has his own shotgun in his hand with barrel broken It is
heavy and almost droops to the ground

Charles removes his spectacles and gestures to his valet
Michael takes William’s gun and loads two cartridges into it
He then snaps the barrel closed and hands it back to William

William looks to be anxious as hell Charles puts protective
spectacles on his eyes Michael puts earphones onto him
William looks to be swamped and lost beneath the protection

He waits with the gun in his hand They all wait some more
and Charles sees that William is waiting too Finally

CHARLES (CONTD)
You have to say pull

WILLIAM
Pull

CHARLES
Don’t whisper say it loud

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021

WILLIAM
Pull

The clay flies William shoots The clay continues to fly
Charles takes a moment and speaks briefly to his valet but
loud enough for William to hear

CHARLES
You only have twenty four hours
Teach him Move with the bird and
aim for the beak One in three
would be bearable

Charles trudges away William glances back through his
yellow tinted glasses at Charles then back at the house

He sees Diana in the window she reads his terror

Then Michael takes his gun and loads it once more

INT SANDRINGHAM DIANAS BEDROOM - DAY 46

Diana is still at the window watching and hears another loud
report from the shotgun She sees Charles trudging back to
the house and can see William further away trying to master
the shotgun

INT SANDRINGHAM LIBRARY - DAY 47

Charles is standing at the window peering out The reports
from the shotgun continue at intervals Diana enters
Charles half turns then turns back to the window Before he
can speak Diana speaks

DIANA
William told me before we came here
he didn’t want to shoot guns

Charles ignores and doesn’t turn (if we want to be brave
Charles could never turn from the window)

CHARLES
I want to talk because someone said
something about clothes

DIANA
Will he be alright

CHARLES
Of course he will be alright Your
dresser said something about
clothes

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021

DIANA
I mean will he be safe

CHARLES
It’s perfectly safe You wear
protective glasses

DIANA
How can it be safe if you have to
wear protective glasses

Diana and Charles speak in clipped uneasy phrases not
answering each other an explosion that never detonates

CHARLES
And yesterday you arrived after The
Queen

DIANA
I got lost

CHARLES
How can you get lost You lived
over the hill for years

DIANA
It looks different now Everything
looks different Except the
scarecrow

Charles half turns and reacts to her odd observation with
weary disbelief

CHARLES
She says you took a jacket off a
scarecrow

DIANA

It was a bit of fun

With Charles Diana is a mixture of defiance fear
politeness

CHARLES
Youre sure you weren’t late
yesterday because you were delayed
by someone

DIANA
Someone

CHARLES
I thought someone might have
delayed you
Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021

DIANA
No

A silence throbbing with accusation and unspoken truths

DIANA (CONTD)
Sometimes you get delayed By
someone No one says anything It’s
perfectly acceptable when you get
delayed by someone

CHARLES
How can you ask if its safe It’s
tradition
DIANA
Why did you send Maggie away
CHARLES
They said she left the curtains
open
DIANA

No I left the curtains open

CHARLES
They are circling us Didn’t you
know Don’t you read They are
hungry for anything Why are you
swapping dresses around

DIANA
Why would you think I got delayed
by someone

CHARLES
Oh come on

Another double report of gun fire

DIANA
He said he didn’t want to shoot
yet

CHARLES

He’s old enough

DIANA
And tomorrow you want him to shoot
real birds

CHARLES
For Gods sake

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021

Before Diana can speak

CHARLES (CONTD)
-Also one of Major Gregory’s men
saw you wandering around in the
grounds last night

At last he turns to her fully Diana reacts to his knowledge

DIANA
I wanted to see my house

CHARLES
The police caught you and didn’t
report it but Gregory’s men saw you
as well They are better than
police They said you were climbing
fences

DIANA
I wanted to go home

CHARLES
It’s boarded up

DIANA
Yes I’d wish it could be un-
boarded but if I wish that out loud
it will mean it definitely won’t
happen

CHARLES
You talk like a baby who isn’t
being spoilt enough

Another double report of gun fire

DIANA
I would like it if you didn’t make
him shoot real birds tomorrow And
I would like it if you didn’t buy
me pearls because you bought us
both the same thing

Charles reacts After a moment a shotgun blast A thunder
cloud across his face perhaps a realisation

DIANA (CONTD)
If they are circling it seems they
are circling just me not you Just
me

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021

CHARLES
Perhaps that’s because I always
take care to close my curtains

A pause Charles softens a little News that she knows
about the pearls is sinking in He searches for words

CHARLES (CONTD)
The thing is Diana there has to be
two of you Two of me two of
Father two of everyone There’s
the real one and the one they take
pictures of

A pause He looks around The guns continue to fire

CHARLES (CONTD)
We are given tasks I hated to
shoot at first So I gave the gun
to the other one You have to be
able to make your body do things
you hate For the good of the
country

A pause Diana is gently incredulous

DIANA
The country

CHARLES
The people They don’t want us to
be people That’s how it is Just
how it is

A pause He looks at her

CHARLES (CONTD)
I’m sorry I thought you knew

Charles takes a moment then walks But as he goes he calls
back

CHARLES (CONTD)
Please stick to the list as it is
written in the order that it’s
written The dresser gets upset

DIANA
I want Maggie back

Charles stops in the doorway
Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021

CHARLES
Someone heard Maggie saying she
thinks you’re cracking up

A pause

DIANA
What

CHARLES
Everybody here hears everything
They just don’t always tell you
what they’ve heard

Charles leaves Diana looks out of the window She can just
make out William taking a shot and the clay pigeon shatters
He grins and raises his fist in triumph and the valet slaps
his back

Diana reacts and looks up at the portrait of Victoria in her
black dress We stay with Diana She sits down and stares
up at Victoria

DIANA (SOFTLY)
No one has died

Then a knock a door opening Diana jumps As ever a
footman has arrived Diana reacts wearily

DIANA (CONTD)
I’m late for something yes

FOOTMAN PAUL
Ma’am everyone will be gathering
in the salon to watch the
television

Diana is distracted near to the window almost lost in
light The footman is unsure if he has been heard

FOOTMAN PAUL (CONTD)
Ma’am it’s ten minutes to three
oclock They are gathering to
watch the Queen’s speech

DIANA
Have you been to Sandringham
before

The footman is wrong-footed

FOOTMAN PAUL
Several times Ma’am

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021

DIANA
You would know if this house is
haunted wouldn’t you

The footman forces a smile

FOOTMAN PAUL
It is quite a recent house A
hundred and fifty years I doubt
ghosts would have taken hold yet

DIANA
Then I must have brought her with
me

Outside another shotgun blast

DIANA (CONTD)
You see I’m having the oddest
dreams There was a book someone
left by my bed and I don’t know why
they left it Or even who left it
there And then I saw her As if
she were a ghost

FOOTMAN PAUL
Saw who Ma’am

Diana sees the look of puzzled embarrassment on Paul’s face
and doesn’t reply After a moment he glances at the clock on
the wall

A pause

Diana gets to her feet and leaves
half smile at her oddness after she has passed

FOOTMAN PAUL (CONTD)
The point is Ma’am they are very
anxious that you arrive before Her
Majesty arrives

Diana nods

FOOTMAN PAUL (CONTD)
There are sandwiches

DIANA
Yes of course there are sandwiches

INT SANDRINGHAM SALON - DAY

The entire family are gathered around a TV set eating

sandwiches and cakes

Paul bows and conceals a

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 68

It is five minutes past three and The Queen is making her
speech (We will recreate it with the original words)

THE QUEEN (ON TV)
we need to remind ourselves of
the essential elements which form
the bedrock of our own free way of
life - so highly valued and so
easily taken for granted

As The Queen continues we come close to Diana with the rest
of the family out of focus Harry comes to sit on Diana’s
lap and she hugs him close He is holding the toy
brontosaurus and whispers

HARRY
It was in the toilet I mean
actually in the bowl

Diana giggles Someone hushes them William glances at Diana
and looks concerned

THE QUEEN (ON TV)
This can be an opportunity to
reflect on our good fortune and on
whether we have anything to offer
by way of example to those who have
recently broken free of
dictatorship

After a moment The Queen gets up and leaves and walks to the
garden (as she always does after one minute) being followed
by her Corgis

Diana watches her go She looks from her to Prince Philip
who is dozing in a large armchair The Queen walks slowly
inexorably like someone who is sleep walking

THE QUEEN (ON TV) (CONTD)
We who claim to be of the free
world should examine what we
really mean by freedom and how we
can help to ensure that once in
place it is there to stay

Diana gently ushers Harry from her lap then gets up and
walks away too in the opposite direction to The Queen All
heads turn at this apparent terrible impropriety William is
alarmed and whispers

WILLIAM
Mummy

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 69

Diana walks The only head which doesn’t turn is Charles who
never once takes his eyes from his mother on the screen

EXT SANDRINGHAM GARDEN - DAY 49

The Queen stands alone in the garden dripping with recent
rain the Corgis scurrying around her Diana approaches The
Queen doesn’t turn

DIANA
Your Majesty

A pause Diana wants to say so much but limits herself to
small talk

DIANA (CONTD)
I really liked the dress you wore
on television

The Queen half turns A half smile

QUEEN
It wasn’t the one my dresser
recommended

A pause Diana wonders how much she knows of the day’s
events

QUEEN (CONTD)
They take a lot of photographs of
you don’t they

DIANA
Yes

QUEEN
Well the only portrait that really
matters is the one they use to put
on the ten pound note

The Queen turns fully
QUEEN (CONTD)
When they take that one you
understand All you are my dear
is currency

The Queen walks on and Diana bows her head

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021

moment in mute as he folds away his menu Then he senses
something A voice

DIANA (OOV)
What happens to the pheasants

He turns quickly Diana is there a little out of breath

DIANA (CONTD)
The ones they shoot tomorrow What
happens to them

Darren is concerned He glances back at the TV He speaks
gently

DARREN
Ma’‘am Shouldn’t you be watching

DIANA
What happens to the pheasants my
son will be shooting

A pause Darren shifts gear

DARREN
After the shoot we dress them
Pluck them Everyone takes a brace
away with them

DIANA
But there are lots left over

DARREN
The staff take some The dogs get
some Some they just

DIANA
Throw away

A pause Darren wasn’t expecting to be engaged on this but
tries to explain gently

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021

DARREN
Pheasants are bred to be shot If
it wasn’t for the guns they
wouldn’t be there

A pause

DARREN (CONTD)
The ones that don’t get shot just
get run over They’re not very
bright birds

Diana nods and half smiles

DIANA
Beautiful but not very bright Did
you read the Vogue article about
me

Silence Darren hears her joking at her own expense and is
concerned for Diana He tries to lighten the mood

DARREN
I’ve put Crepe Suzette d’Abricots
on the dessert menu Your
favourite

Diana looks up at The Queen as she speaks silently to the
Commonwealth

DIANA
Thank you

DARREN
I will make that myself

She is still staring at The Queen on TV

DIANA
Fun

A pause Still staring at The Queen
DIANA (CONTD)
I have been reading about Anne

Boleyn

She turns to Darren He is unsure but guesses this is an
unpleasant reference

DARREN
I never remember which is which

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021

DIANA
She is the one who was beheaded by
King Henry VIII because he said she
was having an affair but in fact
it was Henry who was having the
affair

Darren looks away and we see he knows the resonance

DIANA (CONTD)
I think I saw her A ghost of her
In my room It was a dream but when
I woke up everything was the
same

Darren listens for a moment but then interrupts

DARREN
Ma’am every word said to any member
of staff here becomes currency It
becomes currency in this room

DIANA
Apparently I am destined to be
currency

Darren gestures at the canteen tables and continues

DARREN
The downstairs staff they all sit
at these tables and bring their
shocking bits of conversation
overheard Since yesterday it’s
only been about you

Diana nods

DIANA
Good Excellent Then I am prepared
for my future as a face on a coin
to be passed from hand to hand

DARREN
You don’t even think that

DIANA
Did Maggie say I’m cracking up

DARREN
Who is Maggie

She glares at him

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021

DIANA
I thought she was my friend Did
she say that

DARREN
I don’t listen Ma’am I just cook

Above their heads The Queen’s speech is ending Darren
repeats

DARREN (CONTD)
Some things Ma’am it is best not
to say out loud Ghosts and cutting
off heads and any odd things you
say are repeated here

DIANA
If I don’t say it out loud they can
see it on my face anyway They all
see into me

Darren dares to interrupt

DARREN
Ma’am usually when they sit at
these tables and talk they are
laughing At all the oddness The
scandals But with you they don’t

laugh
A pause
DARREN (CONTD)
They are gentle with you They are
worried
A pause

DARREN (CONTD)
They want you to survive as the
person you were when you first came
ten years ago

Diana looks away She dare not let the emotion explode
though it’s close She rides it and becomes certain

DIANA
Do you have access to wire cutters

Darren is always wrong-footed by Diana He almost smiles
DARREN

Wire cutters And why do you want
wire cutters

TA

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 75

Diana smiles

DIANA
To cut wire

EXT SANDRINGHAM GROUNDS - DAY 53

We see Diana walking through the grounds in her headphones
but we see her through BINOCULARS

In the distance we see Park House with its boundary of barbed
wire and Diana appears to be casually heading in that
direction

We come around to see Major Gregory watching her from a small
mound near to the house

Then we come close to Diana as she walks We don’t hear the
music in her headphones but we see that it is helping her to
dissolve reality for a while

Then from the hedgerow a beautiful cock pheasant emerges and
stops and angles its head to look at Diana well within range
of a pellet (as pheasants foolishly do)

Diana stops and stares at the bird She takes off her
headphones We faintly hear the music She turns it off
The pheasant holds his ground

DIANA
Go on fly away Before it’s too
late

The pheasant walks on pecking the ground Diana can’t help
but laugh at the bird’s innocent naivety Diana sits down on
the wet grass and the pheasant raises its head to consider
the new situation

DIANA (CONTD)
If you are going to fly anywhere
may I recommend Kensington

She nods wisely

DIANA (CONTD)
They wouldn’t shoot you there
They’d feed you Cakes and home
made biscuits and fresh bread baked
this morning They’d make a fuss of
your beautiful feathers ‘Look at
the colours’ they’d say Everyone
would start wearing feathers just
like yours

(MORE)
Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 76

DIANA (CONTD)
And you are so lucky because you
are allowed to wear the same outfit
to every occasion

Suddenly the pheasant flies and as it does

MAJOR GREGORY (OOV)
Forgive me Ma’am

Diana turns sharply Gregory is standing a few yards away
dressed for the weather

MAJOR GREGORY (CONTD)
--but you need to get ready for
dinner

Diana quickly gets to her feet and brushes off wet grass
Gregory checks his watch

MAJOR GREGORY (CONTD)
It’s almost five

DIANA
Dinner isn’t until seven

MAJOR GREGORY
But your dresser needs to dress
you Come

He goes to turn and walk as if his words are enough to summon
her Diana has a moment of defiance She sits back down on
the grass and hooks her arms around her knees

DIANA
I will be along shortly

Diana expects confrontation Instead Major Gregory takes a
moment and steps closer He then sits down on the grass in
front of her He also hooks his arms around his knees He
appears to have a strategy

MAJOR GREGORY
You know some years ago I was in
Belfast The Falls road Sour times
back then

Major Gregory looks away into the distance

MAJOR GREGORY (CONTD)
We were in an alley about to cross
I had a good friend beside me
Soldiers become more than friends
you know And to stop our knees
shaking he was telling me a story
Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 77

Major Gregory smothers emotion

MAJOR GREGORY (CONTD)
He was brought up on a farm up in
the Highlands He was talking
about some horse his father bought
at a fair that couldn’t be tamed
Lots of funny stories about this
wild horse throwing his brothers
around Then he said ‘but then
one fine morning’

A pause for effect as Major Gregory lets the words hang

MAJOR GREGORY (CONTD)
-at that moment the bullet hit
him back of the head Came out
through his nose He fell onto me
I hugged him close to save myself
from the next bullet

A pause

MAJOR GREGORY (CONTD)
And I never did find out what
happened to the wild horse

Diana is impassive waiting for the point Major Gregory tugs
a blade of grass and chews it

MAJOR GREGORY (CONTD)
But afterwards I couldn’t think of
a reason What was that for What
did he die for Not that bloody
shambles in Westminster Not for
home some barns and a lot of debts
or some council flat where the
soldier boys are all from So who
do we soldiers die for I asked
myself

Major Gregory turns to Diana

MAJOR GREGORY (CONTD)
Then I remembered my oath We all
make an oath of loyalty to the
Crown

Major Gregory gestures toward Sandringham

MAJOR GREGORY (CONTD)
It’s not the human beings you see
It’s the oath that you choose to
believe Their faults

(MORE)
Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021

MAJOR GREGORY (CONTD)
Their weaknesses That’s not what
you think about when you are in an
alley in the Falls road you think
only about

Diana interrupts rudely and with refined defiance

DIANA
I said I would be along shortly
And yet you are still here

Major Gregory studies her and sees her defiance is real and
hard

DIANA (CONTD)
I don’t want anyone to die for me
And I hope your friend’s wild horse
was never tamed

Major Gregory glares at her After a moment he gets to his
feet He delivers his bow with deepest irony

MAJOR GREGORY
Ma’am I have been asked to ensure
that this time unlike your arrival
at the house you arrive for dinner
on time It is Her Majesty and the
House of Windsor I am pledged to
serve and I speak with their voice
So please

Major Gregory looks across to Park House

MAJOR GREGORY (CONTD)
There is really no time for
sentiment Ma’am

Major Gregory waits Diana realises he is not leaving without
her She stays seated for a moment She looks back toward
the house and we come close as she fights her emotion Her
weakness Finally she gets to her feet

DIANA (SOFTLY)
Fuck

MAJOR GREGORY
Beg pardon Ma’am

Diana walks past him toward Sandringham Then she stops and
turns and calls out

DIANA
It was you who put the book by my
bed

OO

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 79

Major Gregory looks puzzled

MAJOR GREGORY
What book

DIANA
You put it there as a warning

Major Gregory stares blankly

MAJOR GREGORY
I really have no idea what you are
talking about Ma’am

Diana peers at him and loses her resolve She puts her
headphones on and walks fast Then she begins to run

EMOTIONAL STRING MUSIC FADES IN

EXT PARK HOUSE UNBOARDED - DAY 54

We see Diana 12yrs running across the Park House lawn She
is laughing and other children are chasing her The house
looks alive and the curtains are all open A silhouette of a
man fills a doorway (we don’t see him close but it is her
father) A large Christmas tree decked in lights dominates
the entrance Her father calls out

JOHN SPENCER
Diana Come Dinner is served

Diana laughs and keeps on running Music becomes louder

EXT PARK HOUSE UNBOARDED - OPEN FIELD - MAGIC HOUR 55
MUSICAL MONTAGE SEQUENCE

We see Diana in present day running across the park She
runs and runs with no direction She’s sweating breathing
hard almost if she were about to give birth

We cut to Diana running this time 12 years old wearing a
yellow dress a joyous expression on her face

Diana again now 17 still running She wears a school
uniform She jumps and flies through the air Before she
lands

We cut again she lands she’s now 19 wearing the clothes
she wore when she first met Charles She keeps running fast

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 80

Cut again to Diana wearing her unforgettable white wedding
dress at 20 years old She has trouble running in such a big
and clumsy outfit but she does it anyway She runs faster
than ever

Cut again The music rises We hear almost nothing else
She’s 24 it’s 1985 and she’s wearing the same midnight blue
dress she wore when she danced with John Travolta at the
White House Alone in an open field she dances like she did
that day smiling and happy like never before

Cut again Now she’s wearing the white dress she wore when
she went to dance on stage at the Royal Opera House in
London in 1985 Diana keeps dancing moving freely

Now we see many Dianas at different ages and wearing
different iconic dresses in fast and different cuts The
speed of the montage increases music comes to a climax a
little girl an adolescent various adults versions of Diana
all combined It’s her happy growing changing exuberant
wild beautiful running dancing moving Her expression
is overwhelmingly luminous

Then a sudden and loud BOOM A blast from a shotgun Music
ends Diana our Diana in the present stops paralysed She
looks up and in the distance she sees Charles standing in
the field with his gun and his private valet and the clay
pigeon operator

She’s breathing heavily sweating

DIANA
Who is that man

We see Charles walking away with his valet

INT SANDRINGHAM DIANAS BEDROOM - EVENING 56

Diana enters still out of breath and finds Angela waiting
Diana gently closes the door Angela is in a blade of light
that comes through the closed curtains and she looks almost
ghost-like as she holds up a particular dress She is
anxious but tries to be firm

ANGELA
There seems to have been some
confusion about which dress to wear
and when

DIANA
Yes And you reported my confusion
faithfully Perhaps you’ve taken an
oath

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021

Diana walks to the curtains but the dresser speaks up

ANGELA
The curtains have been fastened

Ma’am

Diana arrives at the curtains and sees thick thread stitching
the curtains together

ANGELA (CONTD)
That is I was told to sew them
By His Royal Highness There have
been reports of people in the
grounds

Diana touches the threads holding the curtains together then
turns and stares at Angela

DIANA
No people Just a fox on a wall
casting a shadow

ANGELA
They think photographers We
thought it wise In case you

forget

Diana stares at Angela Thin winter light makes it through

the cracks in the curtains

DIANA
Yes That is wise

Angela holds up the particular dress again

ANGELA
For Christmas dinner

DIANA
Very wise yes

ANGELA
I took it in You’ve lost weight

Shall we try it on
Diana takes it and walks to the bathroom

ANGELA (CONTD)
Ma’am I will help you

DIANA
How can you help me No one is here

to help me

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021

INT SANDRINGHAM BATHROOM — EVENING 57

We are in the empty full length mirror She steps into the
reflection holding the dress in front of her body She looks
at herself and at the dress

DIANA
I know I will leave my body here
and just send the dress to dinner

We catch a fleeting glimpse of OVERWEIGHT DIANA in the
reflection She suddenly shrieks with laughter

EXT SANDRINGHAM DIANA’S BEDROOM - EVENING 58
Angela hears laughter She goes to the door

ANGELA
Ma’am Are you alright

The laughter continues Angela reacts She glances at the
house phone as the laughter subsides and considers making a
call Then suddenly Diana emerges from the bathroom
wearing the dress (and she looks incredible)

She smiles at some private joke
DIANA

I thought at first it might not fit
me but it does

Angela steps back
ANGELA
Even a little room in it to

accommodate dinner

Diana goes to her father’s black coat and grabs the pearl
necklace and puts it on Angela detects co-operation

ANGELA (CONTD)
Pearls Excellent perfect

Diana twirls in the mirror
DIANA
Yes A prison uniform and a chain
around my neck

Angela is a little overwhelmed

ANGELA
Will you wear it

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021

DIANA
Of course I will wear it It says
on the label Christmas day dinner
and it’s Christmas day dinner What
else would I wear

Angela smiles nervously at her victory

DIANA (CONTD)
Now leave me please I wish to
masturbate

Angela reacts with alarm and curtseys quickly

ANGELA
Yes Ma’am thank you

DIANA
You can tell everyone I said that

She leaves Diana goes to the closed curtains and stares at
them Then she goes to her bag which is on the bed

She takes out a pair of wire cutters

She holds them up in a shaft of light from the sewn curtains
She then begins to clip the thread that holds the curtains
together stitch by stitch The curtains billow and then she
pulls them open ripping the last threads

She stares out at the dying light and the silhouette of the
scarecrow She speaks softly with the wire cutters held
up

DIANA (CONTD)
Papa I got these wire cutters
because I plan to cut the barbed
wire they’ve put around our old
garden and go home for a bit I
really need to sit in my bedroom
for a bit I really need to sit in
a room and for no one to knock the
fucking door and tell me I’m
late

She stops talking and the wire cutters tremble in her hands
Then suddenly and without warning she takes a pinch of skin
on her upper forearm and cuts the flesh with the cutters

Diana gasps as if from relief Blood appears and trickles
DIANA (CONTD)

To just cut the wire and be ina
safer place

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 84

There is a loud knock at the door She jumps

FOOTMAN BRIAN (OOV)
Ma’am Dinner is served in thirty
minutes

The blood trickles down her arm and she places the wire
cutters down She begins to breath quickly

INT SANDRINGHAM BATHROOM — EVENING 59

Diana is pushing tissues to her bloody wound which is
beginning to staunch She looks at herself in the mirror as
she drops the bloody tissue into the lavatory She takes a
moment then walks out of the bathroom

INT SANDRINGHAM DIANA’S BEDROOM - EVENING 60

Diana as herself walks back into the bedroom in a robe
Instantly she is confronted by the vision we saw before (ANNE
BOLEYN) who is standing between the open curtains in the
fading light her face pale She is wearing what looks like
a grey shroud and is holding the wire cutters up

Diana stares at the vision between the curtains Anne Boleyn
puts the cutters to her throat Diana turns and runs
EXT SANDRINGHAM CORRIDOR UPSTAIRS - EVENING 61
We come close to Diana as she runs down the corridor toward

William and Harry’s room Barbara the nanny stands up but
Diana flies past her into the room

INT SANDRINGHAM WILLIAM AND HARRYS BEDROOMNURSERY
MINUTES LATER

William is standing close to the closed bathroom door He is
trying to be the grown up Diana has locked herself inside

WILLIAM
Mummy you said to tell you if you
were being really silly and you are
being really silly

Silence William puts his forehead against the door
WILLIAM (CONTD)

Mummy please We have to sit down
before Grandma
Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 85

Silence Then a knock at the door

FOOTMAN PAUL (OOV)
Ma’am Dinner is served in twenty

minutes

WILLIAM
Yes We will be there We are
just

William closes his eyes tight to fight tears and fails to
complete his sentence After a moment he speaks to the
door

WILLIAM (CONTD)

Mummy just switch your mind off
Just don’t think about it until
after dinner

A long pause At last the door opens Diana emerges still
in her dressing gown There is a smudge of blood on the gown
near her upper arm but she puts her hand over it

DIANA
The chef has made Souffle
d’Abricots just for me Not for
them for me

William wipes his eyes

WILLIAM
Youve got like one minute to get
dressed
Diana nods
DIANA

That’s OK because it only takes me
one minute and I look great anyway
That is the difference There Did
you see her in church

WILLIAM
See who

Diana walks toward the door

DIANA
Jane Seymour of course I will be
one minute

Diana leaves and William looks deeply concerned He looks out
at the fields where the scarecrow stands and the fields and
hilltop are now dark

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 86

EXT DARK FIELD —- NIGHT 63

We are looking back at Sandringham from the same hill top
Lights burn in many windows and we can just make out pages
and footmen hurrying with trays and trolleys of food Inside
dinner is being served Close to us a dry wind blows

As we rise we realise we are looking over the shoulder of the
scarecrow We hear someone coughing

INT SANDRINGHAM DIANA’S BATHROOM - NIGHT 64

We find Diana on her knees in her Christmas dinner dress
throwing up She splutters and tries not to make too much
noise She then sits back against the door of the cubicle
Her pearls are hanging

She registers pain in her upper arm where she cut herself
Her face is soaked in sweat A knock at the door

MARIA (OOV)
Dessert is about to be served
Ma’am

DIANA
Yes Souffle d’Abricots Just for
me

She wipes her face After a moment

MARIA (OOV)
Ma’am I’ve been told to wait for
you

Diana wrecked and in pain speaks brightly

DIANA
That is very kind of you

Silence Diana hauls herself to her feet She unlocks the
door and Maria curtseys Diana looks horrific She walks to
the sink and the mirrors and peers at herself

Then suddenly the lavatory door opens and Maggie enters
Diana sees her reflection spins and grabs her The two
women hug and Maggie growls

MAGGIE
Hold on Fight them Be beautiful
You are you’re own weapon Don’t
cut it to pieces

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 87

DIANA
No no I wont I won’t Maggie
Maggie stay with me

Maria clears her throat Diana looks to her and then to her
horror looks back to Maggie but Maggie isn’t there Diana
takes a huge breath of shock

DIANA (CONTD)
Where did she go

Maria looks afraid

MARIA
Who

DIANA
Maggie was here She was here

MARIA
There was no one here Ma’am

Diana glares at her

MARIA (CONTD)
You spoke to the mirror

Diana takes a moment She looks back to the mirror and peers
at herself In reflection the lavatory door opens and Pamela
enters

PAMELA
They are all waiting

INT SANDRINGHAM CORRIDOR UPSTAIRS - NIGHT 65

Diana walks escorted by Maria and Pamela who look
increasingly like prison guards

We hear the noise of the dinner table beyond a large closed
door The maids usher Diana toward the door Diana stops
hooks her hair behind her ear in a feeble attempt to prepare
But then

DIANA
Tell them I am not well

Diana walks on quickly

PAMELA
Ma’‘am Please

Diana screams

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 88

DIANA
Tell them I am not at all well

Diana walks

INT SANDRINGHAM DARK CORRIDOR DOWNSTAIRS - NIGHT 66

Diana is walking fast down the corridor Then ahead she
sees the vision of Anne Boleyn at a corner a grinning shadow
in moonlight and grey shroud Anne Boleyn smiles

Diana turns the corner and Anne Boleyn is an uncertain shadow
ahead running fast laughing Diana follows and begins to
laugh too

Diana hoots with laughter and runs on through the corridor
where moonlight pours in through high leaded windows and
where Diana herself looks like a fleeing ghost For a
brief moment we see Diana as Anne Boleyn dress hair and
make up

INT SANDRINGHAM CORRIDOR DOWNSTAIRS - NIGHT 67

Paul the footman we met at the start of the story is
sleeping in a chair inside a small office near to the main
door After a moment he stirs He looks up and sees Diana
standing over him looking frightful He jumps and stands up
with alacrity

FOOTMAN PAUL

Ma’am

DIANA
I need a pair of Wellingtons And a
torch

Paul is adjusting

FOOTMAN PAUL
Where are you going

DIANA
Home

Diana looks at the coats hanging on hooks behind him
DIANA (CONTD)
I’m in a terrible hurry I think

they’1l come for me

Paul looks terrified

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 89

FOOTMAN PAUL
Yes Ma’am I’1l get the boots
What size

DIANA
I don’t care

Paul departs Diana looks back at the dark corridors then
peers at the weighing machine near to the door She steps
closer and sees a ceramic plaque on the front of the machine
This time we read the words as Diana reads them out softly to
herself (I’ve found a mid-Victorian weighing machine with
these very words)

DIANA (CONTD)
‘To weigh oneself OFTEN is to know
oneself WELL To know oneself WELL
is to BE WELL’

Diana reacts to the words Paul returns with a pair of
Wellington boots and a torch (flashlight)

FOOTMAN PAUL
They might be a bit big

Diana grabs the boots and torch and disappears Paul
hesitates Then he hurries into the house
EXT SANDRINGHAM GROUNDS - NIGHT 68

In lights from the house we see Diana hurrying away

INT SANDRINGHAM DINING ROOM - NIGHT 69

We see the rest of the family eating desserts We hear a

roar of laughter Major Gregory is standing guard near to
the double doors that lead to the hallway Paul enters and
approaches him discretely

FOOTMAN PAUL
Major Gregory The Princess of
Wales has gone outside

Major Gregory nods gently At the table the conversation is
lively

FOOTMAN PAUL (CONTD)
She said she’s going home

Major Gregory adjusts his cuffs

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021

MAJOR GREGORY
Really How odd

Paul waits for a further reaction

FOOTMAN PAUL
I think it means she’s going to
Park House

A pause Major Gregory peers at him

FOOTMAN PAUL (CONTD)
It’s dangerous Sir The stairs and
floorboards are rotten

MAJOR GREGORY
If a Princess wants to go home then
who are we to stand in her way

Paul reacts

MAJOR GREGORY (CONTD)
If the constables report anything
tell them to let her be That is
all she wants For us all to just
let her be

Paul takes a moment and fights his instinct After a
moment

FOOTMAN PAUL
Yes Sir

EXT PARK HOUSE ROLLED BARBED WIRE FENCE - NIGHT 70

A pair of wire cutters clip the wire One two three four
strands are cut and the wire rolls away We come around and
see Diana light her torch and head toward the house

We time cut as Diana approaches a main door and finds it
locked

EXT PARK HOUSE DEAD OF NIGHT 71

A torch beam illuminates a small service entrance door half
hidden by undergrowth Only someone who knows would know it
was there Diana cuts her hands and fingers as she drags
thorns and bushes from the doorway She finds the door
locked but a shove makes the small bolt fly from its rotted
hinges Diana enters

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 91

INT PARK HOUSE - NIGHT 72

Diana uses the torch beam to reveal the skeleton of what was
once a family home The floorboards creak loudly as she
walks and rats scurry away from the light Diana shivers and
walks on into a larger room

INT PARK HOUSE DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT 73

The beam finds a fine old stone fireplace Diana goes to it
and kneels at the open grate The stone is still blackened by
old smoke She runs her fingertips across the soot and her
fingers are blackened

The torch beam fills the grate and Diana begins to use her
finger to draw pictures in the soot First a glass

DIANA
A glass of milk

She draws a smaller glass in the soot

DIANA (CONTD)
A glass of whisky for Santa

She draws a carrot and a pie

DIANA (CONTD)
-A raw carrot for Rudolph and a
mince pie on a dish

She studies the drawings Then she shines the torch across
the fireplace and sees an open door and beyond it a large and
ornate staircase

INT PARK HOUSE STAIR CASE - NIGHT 74

Diana walks slowly up the stairs training her torch on the
steps and on the walls The walls have rectangular patches
of pale plaster where portraits once hung A wire hangs from
the ceiling where there was once a chandelier

Diana is about to take the next step but the stair creaks and
buckles beneath her The step gives way and Diana almost
falls She shines her torch into the dark void below

She takes a breath and reaches up for the bannister to haul
herself back onto the stairs She shivers in the cold As
she straightens she shines the torch on the rest of the
stairs and sees some are missing others only span half of
the staircase

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 92

The staircase is evidently unsafe but Diana begins to hum to
herself and make her way between the gaps as the stairs creak
and buckle She hooks her hair behind her ear as she walks
and smiles to comfort herself

She begins to walk with care gripping the bannister The
stairs creak loudly as she walks

INTEXT PARK HOUSE LANDING - NIGHT 75

Diana walks across the landing and past an open door She
sees the window in this room is not boarded and an orange
light is flickering on the window Diana hesitates then
enters through the doorway that has no door

Inside she sees the door is off its hinges and is leaning
against the wall next to the doorway The orange light
flickers in the room

Diana puts her torch onto the floorboards and goes to the
window and looks down into the garden There she sees
herself as a twelve year old girl sitting beside a fire
which is casting the flickering light

Diana studies her young self and takes a moment She speaks
softly

DIANA
Yes I remember I looked up at
the window and thought I saw a
ghost

After a moment her twelve year old self looks up from the
fire and locks eyes with Diana The girl stares into Diana’s
eyes then slowly gets to her feet The girl waves gently
Diana waves back

DIANA (CONTD)
Hello Diana Spencer

Diana hears her own name and looks away quickly

DIANA (SOFTLY) (CONTD)
Spencer Ancient history
After a moment she goes to the doorway and manhandles the

door back into the frame and wedges it there as if to shut
out the world

Diana sits down on the bare floorboards with the torch on the
floor casting a cone of light around her making her shadow
on the wall enormous Orange light flickers on the window

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 93

She puts her head on her hands and begins to weep for the
first time openly We stay with her for a while as the tears
drip into the torchlight

INT PARK HOUSE STAIRWAY TOP OF THE STAIRS - NIGHT 76

The light of the torch precedes Diana When she arrives at
the top of the stairs she stops and looks down She shines
the light down the steps making them look like bars of shadow
and light with dark gaps where the stairs have rotted

She takes a moment The stairs are steep and close by is a
hole into the dark void below She could simply let herself
fall into it She considers this possibility She closes
her eyes She stands frozen for a moment

Then she falls

We fall with her and as she falls the world swirls around
her The darkness below becomes solid a hard floor and she
is a second away from landing In that moment

ANNE BOLEYN
Diana

Diana wakes She is standing at the edge of the abyss The
fall was imagined But as she gets her breath she feels a
presence

She turns and sees Anne Boleyn

Anne Boleyn is a vision in the half darkness a face and a
grey shroud Diana closes her eyes

ANNE BOLEYN (CONTD)
You know he gave her a picture of
himself A miniature painting She
wore it around her neck The same
as the one I wore around my neck
So I just tore it off

A pause

ANNE BOLEYN (CONTD)
Go Run Live

With these words Diana grabs the pearl necklace around her
neck (hidden until now) and pulls it hard this time for
real The pure white pearls cascade down and bounce down the
staircase in slow motion The pearls fall down the stairs
and into the dark voids and Diana watches them fall and
bounce and roll

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 94

After a moment she takes a breath hooks her hair behind her

ear She begins to walk elegantly down the stairs as if toa
society ball She disappears into darkness just a blade of

light heading for the door

INT SANDRINGHAM DIANA’S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING 77
Daylight on closed curtains

Diana is sleeping The Boleyn book beside the bed is almost
read to the end There is a knock at the door Diana opens
her eyes but says nothing There is another knock

Diana checks her fingertips and they are smudged with soot
Her trip to Park House was not a dream She sees her hands
are cut and scabbed Then the door opens anyway

Diana turns and sees Maggie Diana reacts but then instantly
closes her eyes

DIANA
Question one Are you real

Maggie gently closes the door and approaches

MAGGIE
Do you fancy a cigarette

Diana opens her eyes Maggie sits on the bed Diana reaches
out and takes her arm and squeezes And squeezes

MAGGIE (CONTD)
Ouch

DIANA
Sorry

Maggie takes a pack of cigarettes from her bag and shakes
them

MAGGIE
By Royal Appointment

EXT STUBBORN SANDS BEACH HUNSTANTON CAR PARK - DAY 78

Diana’s small saloon car pulls up in the deserted car park

It is still early The beach is lonely and beautiful and
windswept Gulls shriek and waves crash onto the rocks and
sand Diana is driving and Maggie is in the passenger seat

When Diana pulls up Maggie goes to get out but Diana speaks
instantly
Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021

DIANA
I’m not getting out
MAGGIE
Why not
DIANA

This is my favourite place in the

whole world I don’t want to spoil
it by putting myself in it feeling
like this

MAGGIE
‘This’ being what

Diana doesn’t answer Maggie takes a moment and looks ahead
at the deserted beach registering the seriousness

MAGGIE (CONTD)
They called me back They said
they needed someone to talk to you

DIANA
Who is ‘they’

MAGGIE
The Prince of Wales

Diana half smiles and looks out to the ocean It seems
Charles is human

DIANA
That was good of him

MAGGIE
He is not bad None of them are

Diana reflects
DIANA
The last time I came here to this
beach I hardly knew him I still
had so many questions
A pause
DIANA (CONTD)
That was before I knew that the
answer to most of them was ‘no’

Maggie stares ahead too and mock-completes the sentence

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021

MAGGIE
Said the Princess with her
diamond encrusted Rolex her
diamond rings her seven houses
her hundred maids her loyal
dresser

Diana looks away as if the observation were pointless

MAGGIE (CONTD)
Have you been taking pills

DIANA
Some

MAGGIE
What sort

DIANA

Oh you know the sort that make all
the spiky sharp things in your
life seem like nice balloons

Maggie nods

MAGGIE
And youve been mixing the pills
with alcohol

DIANA
Champagne Can I have my cigarette
now

MAGGIE

If you want to smoke you have to
get out of the car

Diana leans back and sighs A pause

MAGGIE (CONTD)
Anyway to get to the point they
think your behavior is probably
drug induced and they’ve asked me
to suggest that you see a doctor

Diana doesn’t react

MAGGIE (CONTD)
They say you cut yourself again

DIANA
How do they know

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021

MAGGIE
They know everything

DIANA
Not true They don’t know that Anne
Boleyn saved my life last night

Maggie reacts as Diana defies with a smile Maggie takes
Diana’s hand gently and Diana continues

DIANA (CONTD)
You know I’ve been imagining how LI
will be in the history books Ina
thousand years If you are Royal
the more time that passes the
fewer words are used to describe
you William is just ‘The
conqueror’ Elizabeth is the
virgin

She turns to Maggie

DIANA (CONTD)
If I ever become Queen what will I
be One word

A pause Maggie looks ahead

DIANA (CONTD)
Will that one word be ‘insane’

A pause

DIANA (CONTD)
He said you told someone you
thought I was cracking up Did you
say it

A long pause as Maggie makes an important decision She
speaks with formality

MAGGIE
Before I answer that question
Ma’am for what it’s worth I’ve
never told you this before and it
probably means you will fire me but
I am actually in love with you

Diana turns and stares at Maggie
MAGGIE (CONTD)

Yes I mean in that way
Completely

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021

Diana turns back quickly and looks straight ahead

MAGGIE (CONTD)
So right now the one word I would
use to describe you is ‘shocked’
Diana the shocked

Diana stares ahead for a while and Maggie stares ahead too

DIANA
Goodness

MAGGIE
Yes There What do you say to
that

After a moment Diana suddenly bursts out laughing Maggie
smiles

MAGGIE (CONTD)
You see I just knew it would help
They use electricity to shock
delusional people Shock does
wonders apparently

Diana is holding her laughter in with her hand

MAGGIE (CONTD)
I know you don’t see me in that way
and it’s perfectly fine but I
thought I’d lighten the gloom with
something totally unexpected Just
think of all the times I’ve been
with you naked

DIANA
Maggie it is a surprise but I am
completely grown up about this

MAGGIE
No youre not You’re having a
childish giggle and I love it Fuck
doctors Fuck pills and drugs
What you need is love shocks and
laughter Are you ready to walk
now

Diana stops laughing and takes a deep breath

DIANA
You know what I fucking am

MAGGIE
Good Merry Christmas by the way

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021

DIANA
Yes merry fucking Christmas God
Maggie Wow I mean thank you
How can you fancy me I mean why

Maggie and Diana get out of the car

EXT STUBBORN SANDS BEACH HUNSTANTON - DAY 79

In wide we see Maggie and Diana walking down onto the beach
arm-in-arm laughing into the wild wind We see Maggie
lighting Diana’s cigarette shielding it against the wind

We come close as Diana takes the first drag of the cigarette
and closes her eyes with relief Maggie lights her own
cigarette and drags The smoke blows away wildly Their
faces are close and Maggie takes Diana gently and hugs her
We see the emotion on Diana’s face Then Maggie leans back
and declares loudly against the wind and crashing waves

MAGGIE (LOUDLY)
You see the thing is the thing you
must remember is this If you want
to you can just run away

A pause

DIANA
That’s what Anne Boleyn said

Maggie accepts the oddness and continues

MAGGIE
Then the one word to describe you
would be ‘free’

Diana reacts The notion appears to hit her like a
revelation Maggie yells

MAGGIE (CONTD)
Diana the Free

We pull wide again

In wide we see Diana walk away from Maggie and stand alone
facing out to sea pulling up the collar of her coat Still
in wide we see her put her arm across her eyes to hide tears

Then after a moment close to shot the hood of a Range
Rover appears The car pulls up The driver is hidden by a
sun visor Major Gregory gets out of the passenger seat and
stands by his open door for a moment checking his watch He
stares down at Diana with her arm over her eyes

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 100

He appears to relish his position He leans into the car and
hoots his horn Maggie turns Diana does not

MAJOR GREGORY
Ma’‘am We are almost ready to
begin the shoot

After a moment Diana drops her arm from her eyes Still in
wide and from behind we might imagine we see her make the
biggest decision of her life and don’t even need to come
close

Exquisite music begins

INT SANDRINGHAM KITCHEN - DAY 80
The kitchen is empty of people but filled with glorious food

On the surfaces and central table there is a banquet for the
eyes and stomach We might guess the brigade have been
working through the night

There is pulled and grilled chicken roast meats sandwiches
savory pastries and pies There is fois gras and caviar and
packs of Highgrove organic biscuits and crackers There are
stacks of mince pies and candied fruits and chocolates

On a separate surface bottles of Champagne wine port
whisky and rum Beyond them trays of cut glass dishes and
wine goblets There are also stacks of plates and regiments
of cutlery There are ten bowls of quail eggs

As the music plays we survey the finest picnic ever
assembled A tap drips The bell in the high corner rings
After a moment Darren leads the brigade into the kitchen and
they walk in slowly and survey their work

After a moment

DARREN
Brigade One hour to the guns

A pause

DARREN (CONTD)
Load the shoot boxes

The music picks up (and we repeat the mood of the opening
sequence)

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 101

INT SANDRINGHAM ARMORY - DAY 81
Darkness then a door is unlocked and pulled open Three
estate staff enter with bunches of keys and they begin to
unlock the oak doors of large cabinets Inside we see rows
and rows of single barrel and double barrel shotguns

Two more junior staff members enter and unlock drawers They
take out boxes of shotgun cartridges The music drives on
EXT COUNTRY ROAD - DAY 82
Bird song Then a fleet of old Land Rovers drive by in
convoy

EXT DIRT TRACK - DAY 83
The same convoy bumps over rough ground toward the edge of a
misty wood where crows and rooks scatter

EXT SANDRINGHAM ENTRANCE - DAY 84
A fleet of brand new Land Rovers drives up the drive way and
parks up The estate staff with the shotguns and ammunition
are waiting and they begin the process of loading the guns
into the cars

INT SANDRINGHAM WILLIAM AND HARRY’S BEDROOMNURSERY - DAS5
In a shaft of bright winter light we see Charles crouching
to fasten the buttons on Williams waxed Barbour jacket fresh
out of the wrapper

Charles peers at William He is sympathetic and genuine

CHARLES
Just do your best OK

William nods his head Music roars

INT SANDRINGHAM KITCHEN - DAY 86

The chefs and porters are arriving in the kitchen with large
oak boxes a hundred years old and more

As they arrive Darren organises for them to be set down in
rows and opened Each box is silk lined and with aged yellow
silk and the opening of the boxes should look like the
opening of hungry mouths almost in unison

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 102

The chefs then begin to carefully load the exquisite food
into the boxes with Darren patrolling hands behind his back

DARREN
Eggs dairy and cheese are friends
Meat and oil are enemies Remember
salt cellars lie down with spices
in muslin bed sheets

The bell on the wall rings loudly

DARREN (CONTD)
Faster but with care

EXT SANDRINGHAM ENTRANCE - DAY 87

From the side of the house three dog handlers appear with
four dogs each on leashes The dogs are Golden Retrievers and
they are baying with excitement A dark van pulls up from
beyond the house and the dogs are loaded into the van

Everything is done with military precision

As they are loaded a second van arrives As it pulls up the
chefs and porters overseen by Darren begin to emerge from
the side of the house carrying the oak boxes

The chefs place the oak boxes into the back of the van The
placing is solemn and ritualized The music turns it almost
into a dance

When the last box is placed the Royal Family emerge from the
house and go to their allocated cars

We see Darren looking on registering that Diana is not with
them glancing back at the house

Major Gregory emerges from the house and checks his watch

He also silently acknowledges an absence He looks to
Charles inside the car Charles nods once for them to depart
anyway

William looks down to hide his emotion
Major Gregory nods an instruction to the lead driver and the

drivers all get into their vehicles Major Gregory himself
gets into the last one

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 103

EXT OPEN COUNTRY - DAY 88

The odd sight of a fleet of Land Rovers bumping across a

meadow toward a dip in the landscape where a river flows

beautifully The vans follow Crows circle waiting for
carrion

In wide we see the convoy pull up in an organized line
bonnets facing toward the distant woods

EXT OPEN COUNTRY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WOODS —- DAY 89

The convoy of old Land Rovers drives across the open field
and then parks up in ragged order The men get out three to
a car They are dressed in rough country clothes and as
they emerge there is a festive atmosphere

We should know that these men are the BEATERS who drive the
pheasants and other game birds onto the guns

The men have thick Norfolk accents as they wish each other a
Merry Christmas

EXT OPEN COUNTRY ROYAL SIDE - DAY 90

On the other side of the woods the family step out into the
chilly morning air We see William looking back across open
country toward the scarecrow which has its back turned to
them

EXT OPEN COUNTRY OTHER SIDE - DAY 91

The men open their boots and pull out pikes and sticks and
coloured flags on canes Each car has a quartermaster who
hands out the sticks

EXT OPEN COUNTRY ROYAL SIDE - DAY 92

At the same time valets are unloading shotguns from the backs

of the vehicles and handing them out to the loaders

Ammunition is allocated as if for battle Meanwhile

steaming hot tea is being poured into enamel mugs and handed

to the women watching

EXT OPEN COUNTRY OTHER SIDE - DAY 93

The men here are now all armed with sticks and pikes and
flags The men begin to fan out and walks toward the stand
of trees at the top of the hill

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 104

EXT OPEN COUNTRY ROYAL SIDE - DAY 94

The men of the family and their Royal guests are now all
armed with shotguns - and Princess Anne as the only woman
among the shooters They begin to form a line facing the
woods The van doors are opened and the dogs are brought out
and held back by the handlers

The baying of the dogs echoes across the valley

EXT OPEN COUNTRY OTHER SIDE - DAY 95

The sound of dogs baying indicates that the shooters are
ready On a signal from a leader the men enter the woods and
begin to thrash the undergrowth yell and blow whistles

EXT SCARECROW FIELD - DAY 96
Diana and Maggie pull up at the place where Diana met Darren
at the opening The scarecrow is nearby Diana takes the
keys from the ignition and offers them to Maggie

We can clearly hear the baying of dogs the whistles and
yells of the beaters Diana seems more calm and controlled
than we have ever seen her

DIANA
Drive back to the house but don’t
give the keys to the valet Park
it in the servant car park and
leave the keys in the glove
compartment

An anxious pause

MAGGIE
Why What are you going to do

A pause

DIANA
Take my place among the pheasants

Maggie looks troubled

MAGGIE
No seriously

Diana interrupts firmly
Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 105

DIANA
Seriously Maggie it’s all just a
bit of fun isn’t it Sex men
women wives husbands mistresses
deceit succession Currency
that’s all we are When you read it
in a book it’s as if it was always
going to happen anyway What
fucking choice do any of us have

Maggie hears certainty and doesn’t persist with her question
Diana takes her hand

DIANA (CONTD)
And thank you for loving me It’s
very nice of you

MAGGIE
‘Nice’

DIANA
I’m ordinary and simple and I like
nice things that are actually very
middle class and unfashionable I
like ‘Phantom of the Opera’ and
‘Les Miserables’ and I feel sorry
for pheasants There is no hope for
me And I bet if you asked the
pheasants ‘do you want a nice quiet
life in a cage being fed corn all
day or would you prefer to be set
free and fly and be shot at and
take your chances in the wild
world they would choose to fly I
bet they would So This isn’t
about birds

OOO

MAGGIE
What isn’t

DIANA (NOT ANSWERING)
It’s about me

Diana opens the door
DIANA (CONTD)

I’1l see you back in Kensington
with a pheasant feather in my hat

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 106

EXT OPEN COUNTRY SHOOTING FIELD - DAY 97

We should see the scene in very wide So wide we can see the
beaters cars parked on one side of the woods and the Royal
Land Rovers on the other

(The fact that the woods divide the classes is a visual
statement)

We hear the beaters whistles and yells and see the Royal
shooters begin to load their guns almost in unison

(We come close to see the loaded guns being snapped shut and
aimed at the clouds We see William being handed his loaded
gun He swallows hard)

Then we are wide again as the first of the pheasants begin to
flee from the woods and undergrowth Pheasant flight is
awkward and noisy and slow The guns are about to take their
toll

The first shots explode and echo across the valley Puffs of
smoke appear from the barrels For now the pheasants are out
of range More pheasants appear But then

Between the woods and the line of guns a figure appears in a
dark jacket directly below the line of fire The figure
marches with purpose and is holding the hand of a young boy
They are walking into the danger zone

We come close to William as he reacts before we realise He
repeats with dread

WILLIAM
Oh God Oh Mummy

We come close to Diana as she marches under the flying
pheasants Harry is looking up and laughing Diana has no
expression just a firm resolve We now come close to Major
Gregory who reacts He quickly yells

MAJOR GREGORY
Saboteur Hold your fire

The guns fall silent and are lowered The dogs still are
baying and straining at their leashes A dry wind blows The
beaters have now made it through the woods and stand in a
line facing the shooters

Diana comes to a halt between the shooters and the beaters
Now even the dogs fall silent Diana holds out her arms and
stands like a scarecrow After a moment she calls out
Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 107

DIANA
William I want to take you home

William reacts He lowers his gun Charles reacts with
stone-faced horror at this embarrassment before the entire
family

DIANA (CONTD)
I’m not moving from this place
until William comes to me

A pause She smiles

DIANA (CONTD)
You’1l have to just shoot me

Suddenly the royal shooters resemble a firing squad (and the
image is deliberate) The wind blows and the dogs bark
again

Charles takes a moment Pheasants fly directly through the
line of guns with a clatter of feather and bone their lives
saved Charles turns to William and for the first time we
see an unexpressed sadness on his face In just this moment
we see a man crushed by his life

He speaks words of kindness

CHARLES
Go Try to help her I never could

William hesitates for a moment There’s a long silence and
Charles looks deeply sorrowful Gregory calls out

GREGORY
Your Highness should I

Charles interrupts with a calm voice

CHARLES
My son is going to join his mother
Everyone hold your fire

William thanks his father with a look He hands his shotgun
to one of the loaders then walks and then runs to Diana

He arrives at her and Diana grabs him and twirls him around
Harry fires a pretend shotgun at the sky with a ‘bang bang’

We see Charles peer at them The others all stare ahead
impassively

We go back to super wide to see Diana William and Harry
walking hand-in-hand off the field of battle between the guns
and beaters

Spencer - Shooting Script - Steven Knight - 4th January 2021 108

INT SANDRINGHAM ENTRANCE HALL - DAY 98

Paul the footman who first greeted Diana is holding the
fort reading a newspaper in the small office He looks up
as he hears footsteps

Diana is hurrying toward the door with William and Harry
Paul stands to attention as Diana heads for the door Then
she stops and peers at the weighing machine

She diverts and drags William and Harry toward it Paul
emerges from his office as Diana stands on the scales then
tugs William and Harry to stand on the scales with her

The dial creaks and thuds to a heavy weight Paul hovers and
Diana calls out

DIANA
There Seventeen and a half stone
Look how much I enjoyed myself

She steps off the scales and walks with the boys to the front
door Paul calls out

FOOTMAN PAUL

compartment Inside she finds car keys and a note She
opens it up and reads

‘It’s not just me who loves you’

against the cold She then turns back to the boys She
opens up a carton of ketchup

DIANA (CONTD)
Better with ketchup

William and Harry both dip their chips in the small carton

She grabs William’s chicken leg from his hand and takes a big
bite The church bells ring as she savors the flavor of real
food We pull wide and see an ordinary family lost among the
