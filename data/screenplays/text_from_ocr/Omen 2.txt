DAMIEN - OMEN II
FADE IN
EXT ACRE HARBOR - DUSK 1

Skyline of mosques and ancient towers is a vicious red Lit
py weakened rays of the setting sun CAMERA PANS ACROSS the
walls of the old Crusader city and DOWN to the harbor A
jeep comes to a halt at the far end

BUGENHAGEN once powerful man in his late fifties with
heavy shoulders and bull neck climbs painfully out His
hair and beard are now white His face is drawn and anxious
He picks up a small dusty leather box and some newspapers
and limps towards one of the harbor cafes

EXT CAFE DUSK 2

The sea smacks against the rocks below the cafe terrace
Beyond small boys dive from the ruined walls once defended
by the Crusaders

Inside sitting alone is MICHAEL MORGAN He sips his
Turkish coffee and brandy and turns the page of his book

A precise man Morgan English in his fifties a respected
archaeologist

Bugenhagen hobbles through the doors and approaches his

friend Morgan looks up over his halfglasses and sees

Bugenhagen He stands obviously surprised to see him

hey eats OUTSIDE to WATCH them exchange greetings

INT CAFE DUSK 3
Bugenhagen thrusts newspaper in front of Morgan His finger

strikes headline US AMBASSADOR AND WIFE BURIED TOGETHER

Morgan stares at his old friend worried for him --

MORGAN

BUGENHAGEN

speaking to an old friend who is balanced on the edge of a
breakdown

dig-hardened finger

MORGAN

friend I think he could use

EXT BELVOIR CASTLE MOAT - DAWN 4

The rising sun gives the same livid red coloring to the ruins
and the vast Jordan Valley below them Belvoir the great
Crusaders castle is situated at the top of a steep hill
The dig is immense and complex and deserted A distant buzz
prompts the CAMERA TO PAN SLOWLY AROUND and FIND a jeep
climbing up to the wide moat

Bugenhagen looking even more ashen switches off the engine
Morgan wrapped in a warm blanket is asleep in the back

BUGENHAGEN
(shaking him)
Michael

Morgan groans and opens one red eye
MORGAN
I trust all this will guarantee me
a place in the Kingdom of Heaven

Bugenhagen grunts and hands him a miners helmet and flash--
light He then picks up the leather box and they move off

EXT BELVOIR CASTLE - DAWN 5

Long-haired sheep nervously graze among the decaying walls
and arches Their blank colorless eyes start as the two
archaeologists appear Their bells clang discordantly as
they run off in panic stopping to stare as Bugenhagen and
Morgan approach the long dark staircase encased in the
castles outer wall They switch on their miners lamps
and begin to descend the worn steps

ANGLE IN THE DAWN SKY 5-A
Above the dig a large crow slowly circles

ANGLE ON THE TWO MEN AGAIN 5B
as they continue to descend the steps

MUSIC BEGINS AS DOES THE FEELING OF CLAUSTROPHOBIA THEY
ARE INDEED WALKING INTO THEIR OWN TOMB

INT BELVOIR CASTLE (ACRE) - BANQUET HALL 6

vast dark A line of six fifty-foot high pillars runs “he
length of the chamber Bugenhagen enters followed closely
by Morgan They switch on their flashlights and cross to a
further excavation at the base of one pillar Bugenhagen
moves painfully onto the ladder

MUSIC GROWS THE FEELING OF DOOM IS OVERWHELMING

Morgan has lagged behind Bugenhagen turns to see where he
is His miners lamp finds a face thats uneasy in this
eerie place Morgan follows reluctantly Blackness closes
in as they descend and enter the tunnel below

INT BELVOIR CASTLE (ACRE) - TUNNEL 7

Lamps flash along the tunnel On the floor duckboards have
been laid Obviously this is where the most recent
excavations are being carried out Equipment and discoveries
all covered in plastic line one side of the tunnel Morgans
lamp scans the objects as he moves along behind Bugenhagen

He stops beside one particular piece and bends down to

examine it Its a huge stone carving A WOMAN SITTING UPON
A SCARLET-COVERED BEAST THE BEAST IS COVERED WITH CARVED
NAMES AND HAS SEVEN HEADS AND TEN HORNS He gently lifts

the plastic to get a better view of the unpleasant sculpture

MORGAN
(touches the piece)
The Whore of Babylon
(calling)
Carl have you --

He looks up to see Bugenhagen disappearing through an exit
in the tunnelts side The old man doesnt hear him Morgan
carefully replaces the plastic

BUGENHAGEN
(os)
Come and see Michael

Morgan moves to the exit He pauses there watching
Bugenhagen in the low cavern beyond The old mans flasa-
light is moving over a wall painting partly hidden by ths
base of a huge pillar

BUGENHAGEN
This will convince youl

MUSIC SWELLS THE TOMB IS ABOUT TO BE CLOSED

As Morgan moves in the direction of the wall theres the
SOUND of a crack like a bullwhip followed by a deep and
frightening rumble He stops in his tracks At that monent
the tunnel roof gives way and crashes in an avalanche of
stone and dirt Morgan looks back into the tunnel

MORGAN
Is there another way out

BUGENHAGEN
No

They both reenter the tunnel and begin pulling away the
rubble

Suddenly theres another ear-splitting crack and rumble
The roof behind them now caves in Their tomb is no more
than five feet wide The crash is followed by a deathly
silence Morgan looks at Bugenhagen in horror The old
mans eyes are closed resigned preparing for death Then
the silence is broken by the quietest but most sinister
sound -- running sand A steady stream of it falls before
Morgans face He looks up Holes appear in the roof
Through each of them sand begins to rapidly pour into the
cavity They are trapped in an hourglass thats worth alll
of five minutes

MORGAN
Carl --

He looks down There at his feet is the WHORE OF BABYLON
The sand is already covering it and the sculptured faces
mock him through the plastic He begins to panic claws
again at the rubble

BUGENHAGEN
The Anti-Christ is with us Give
yourself to God

as it turns in panic then disappears in a cloud of dust

Model The ceiling and pillars lurch Part of it crumbles
with a loud crack

“INT BELVOIR CASTLE - TUNNEL 10

The sand is already at waist height Morgan moans and
continues to claw at the debris His efforts are futile
Bugenhagens eyés are closed

BUGENHAGEN
(quietly)

and he had power to give life
unto the image of the BEAST that
the image of the Beast should both
speak and cause that as many would
NOT worship the image of the Beast
should be killed

INT BELVOIR CASTLE - BANQUET HALL 11
Model The noise is terrifying as a final lurch brings
everything toppling down in a cascade of flying rubble
ANGLE ON CROW HIGH ABOVE THE DIG 11-A
It circles as the sun begins to pour great heat down on
the land

INT BELVOIR CASTLE - TUNNEL 12

Sand is at chin-level and rising Bugenhagen continues
to pray

BUGENHA GEN
the forces of evil may seem to
overwhelm us and be triumphant
but goodness will prevail For it
is written in the Book of Revelation
and then shall that WICKED be
revealed whom the Lord shall consume
with the spirit of His mouth and
shall destroy with the brightness
of His coming

The sand reaches their eyes Morgans muffled screams are
horrible His eyes roll in their sockets Bugenhagen
remains calm to the end The sands of time run in until
even the lamps of their miners helmets are extinguishec
BLACKNESS TOTAL AND ABSOLUTE BLACKNESS

wintery wind moans and whips the few trees into movement
The confident sound of the cars engine continues then
suddenly falters The vehicle slows to a halt as the
engine cuts out altogether Wind drops as suddenly as it
blew up leaving an eerie silence Carts ignition is
turned but fails to bring any life to the engine Again
and again the key is turned in frustration

along the road Nervous she switches on the car radio
punching up the different stations in frustration One
catches her ear A rabid preacher frightening the life out
of his listeners

Further glances up and down the road No cars in sight
The billboard opposite again takes her attention She gets
out of the car and leans across to the backseat for her
coat Theres an abrupt fluttering sound followed by strange
scratching on metal She jumps back There by her face
a crow settles its enormous wings and eyes her from the

car roof Joan gasps and moves instinctively away The
crows nasty little eyes never leave her She waves her
coat ineffectually to frighten it away but the bird doesnt
move Joan kicks the car door shut and moves off watching
the crow as she pulls on her coat Even with the gap widen-
ing between her and the car she looks nervously back The
crow just sits there Twenty yards Thirty Forty She
takes a final look -- the crow has gone Disquieted she
looks all around The bird has disappeared and with it go
her anxieties She settles down to cover the three miles
without again looking back CAMERA FOLLOWS her Theres
an awful screech and the crow descends from behind It
crash-lands on her head and WE SEE it lean forward yellow
beak open Joan lets out a piercing scream and flails at
the bird with her arms But the claws embedded in her hair
wont be dislodged and the crow continues to pivot and peck
at her face Its beak is now saturated in blood When

the poor demented woman finally turns WE SEE her eyes

are gone from the bloody sockets The crows wings open
wide and like an avenged angel it lifts off into the sky
CAMERA RISES ABOVE the blinded woman reeling about the
tarmac and finally slipping down the shoulder into a field
Her screams and sobs float up unheeded A new and distant
sound begins to intrude The high-floating CAMERA SWINGS
TO INCLUDE more of the highway WE SEE a massive articulated
lorry speeding along too fast

NEW ANGLE ON JOAN 50

Her blood-spattered hands claw at her face as if trying to
replace her eyes Suddenly she stops sobbing and hears
the approaching lorry She gets to her feet and tries
vainly to find the highway holding out her arms as if
playing “Blindmans Buff CAMERA ABOVE COLDLY WATCHES

as she bumps into a tree beside the highway She struggles
up the embankment clawing and calling out She rushes out
from behind the tree as the lorry bears down There is
nothing the Driver can do He tries to brake Screaming
tires and a sickening thud heralds the demise of Joan Hart
Her body bounds into the air and lies still when it lands
on the roof of the slithering truck The silence would de
absolute but for the idling of the lorrys engines and the
caw of the crow The big bird circles then flies casually
away «
