We hear the faint sound of CAR TIRES running over the
CONCRETE SEAMS of a highway Eventually

MAN’S VOICE (VO)
Duncan are you asleep

CUT TO

INT STATION WAGON - DAY 1

CLOSE ON DUNCAN staring off lost in thought Some
SUITCASES and COOLERS flank him It’s a little cramped

PULL BACK to reveal he’s sitting in that ill-conceived back
bench seat that faces out the rear of a vintage 1971 Buick
Estate station wagon

MAN’S VOICE (0S)
-- Duncan

CLOSE ON REARVIEW MIRROR TRENT RAMSEY (MANS VOICE) glances
back at Duncan

TRENT
Duncan are you sleeping

Clearly Duncan wishes he was

DUNCAN
No

DUNCAN’S POV of a SUV of TEENAGERS passing by They gawk
flip him off

TRENT
Let me ask you something Ona
scale from one to ten what do you
think you are

Beat No response

TRENT (CONTD)
Duncan I’m asking you how you see
yourself On a scale from one to
ten

DUNCAN
I don’t know

TRENT
What You need to speak up buddy
DUNCAN
(louder)
I don’t know

DUNCANS POV of a BILLBOARD on the opposite side of the
highway It reads “Turn around You missed it Water Wizz
Waterpark Two miles back”

TRENT
What don’t you know How you see
yourself You don’t have an
opinion

Duncan doesn’t respond
TRENT (CONTD)

I’m just curious Pick any number
on a scale

DUNCAN
A six

TRENT
What

DUNCAN
A six

Trent takes this in
TRENT

I think you’re a three
Damn Duncan definitely doesn’t know how to respond

TRENT (CONTD)
Do you know why I think youre a
three Do you know what would make
me say that
(beat)
Duncan

DUNCAN
No
TRENT
You don’t know why You have no
idea
DUNCAN
No
TRENT

Youve got to speak up
Duncan turns all the way around making eye contact with
Trent in the rearview mirror

DUNCAN
(louder)
No

TRENT
Well from what I’ve observed I
can’t say I see you putting
yourself out there buddy

From this vantage point Duncan surveys the landscape In
the back seat comfortably stretched out asleep and
listening to her iPod is STEPH

TRENT (CONTD)

Meeting kids your own age And
from what your mom tells me you
seem content just to hang around
her apartment

And riding shotgun his mom PAM She’s asleep as well

TRENT (CONT’D)

Is that a fair assessment That
youre happy to just Not do
anything Because see that’s a
“three” to me

Duncan glances back at Trent in the mirror

TRENT (CONTD)

But the good news is I can tell
you that there’s going to be plenty
of kids and plenty of
opportunities at the beach for you
to take advantage of this summer
And it’s a big summer for all of
us really See if we can make
this work You and your Mom me
and Steph All making it work
together As a family

(beat)

So what do you say Let’s try to
improve that score Aim higher
than a three

Duncan sits back down facing out the back Grabs his iPod

TRENT (CONTD)
That sound good

(beat)
You up for that buddy
He puts his earphones in as we BEGIN MAIN TITLES

EXT HIGHWAY - DAY 2

The station wagon in all its glory Mint condition
Strapped to the top more BAGS As for the rest of the cars
on the highway very much 2012 The station wagon pulls off
the EXIT RAMP Another BILLBOARD reads “This is it This is
the exit Water Wizz Waterpark”

EXT STREET - DAY 3

The station wagon drives along the main street A quaint
beach town Dated TOURISTSLOCALS flood the sidewalks
The station wagon arrives at a

STOP SIGN A CONVERTIBLE pulls up behind The DRIVER is
wearing classic Vaurnet sunglasses Although retro they
work for him The Driver looks right at Duncan enjoying the
awkwardness Duncan doesn’t know where else to look The
Driver nods smiles The station wagon continues straight
as the convertible turns off to the left screeching away

EXT BEACH HOUSE - DAY 4

The station wagon pulls into the DRIVEWAY Beach front
Prime real estate The house a very masculine vibe

END MAIN TITLES

EXT BEACH HOUSE - FRONT YARD - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 5

Trent unpacks Duncan takes in his “home” for the summer
Pam steps up behind him puts her hand on his shoulder This
is our first good view of Pam wearing a stylish HEAD SCARF
In fact her whole look is unique Her own Duncan and Pam
notice the “name” of the house over the DOORWAY “Riptide”

Suddenly BETTY pops out a Greyhound cocktail in hand Her
house’s name “Booze Cruizin’”

BETTY
Yoohoo

TRENT
(under his breath)
Are you kidding We just got here

Betty descends the stairs
BETTY

Thank God One more night of
drinking alone and I was going to
kill myself

(then re cocktail)
Yes I’m off the wagon again
Accept it and move on

(then re station wagon)
Nice ride Trent Does the eight
track still work

TRENT
(smiling)
What This is exactly the car my
dad used to drive us in

BETTY
Huh Old and shitty

TRENT
You know how much I paid for this
It’s in cherry condition

BETTY
A car salesman with bad taste
Shocker

Betty turns to Pam invading her space

BETTY (CONTD) PAM
Hi I’m Betty Hi Pam

BETTY (CONTD) PAM
Trent’s probably already No um We were just

talked shit about me It’s

What did he say

BETTY PAM
(off scarf) Oh thank you
I’m loving this I couldn’t
pull it off My hair seems
to hate me

BETTY PAM
(to Trent) (giving up)
I like her - Okay

Pam goes to pull a suitcase out of the car

TRENT
What’s not to like

Pam catches Trent ogling Embarrassed she looks at Betty
BETTY
Oh honey Get it where you can
Id be on my back after a line like
that

Just then we hear a SCREEN DOOR CLOSE Betty looks up to
find SUSANNA THOMPSON her daughter standing on their deck
She’s quite cute A very “mature beyond her years” look

BETTY (CONTD)
Susanna Trent’s here And this is
his girlfriend Pam Say “Hi”

Duncan curious peeks over the top of the car

SUSANNA
Hi

Beat Susanna stays put Betty waits for more

BETTY

(sarcastic)
Yeah but don’t come down

(to PamTrent sotto)
Just stand there brooding

(then noticing Duncan)
Oh You’ve brought me a man How
thoughtful Who is this in all his
“awkward stage” glory

Duncan embarrassed peers over the top of the station wagon
seeing if Susanna heard that

DUNCAN’S POV of Susanna going back inside
Pam puts her arm around Duncan pulls him in

PAM
This is my son Duncan

She brushes the hair out of his eyes

BETTY

Oh my God I was going to name my
youngest “Duncan” but my ex-
husband thought it was nerdy So
we went with “Peter” Which
personally I think is worse But
it fits my son so

(then to Duncan)
Don’t worry you wear the name
well Trent where’s Steph
TRENT
Well weve been here all of two
minutes so probably changing for
the beach

BETTY
(to Pam)
She’s just like me Screw cancer
I want to be an even golden brown
Everywhere

Trent Pam and Duncan start lugging stuff inside There’s
plenty to grab but Betty doesn’t notice

BETTY (CONTD)

Well everybodys back this year
The Gales The Hutchisons The
Campbells sans Ben because of the
trial

(then to Pam)
Insider trading

The Smythes Oh and the Keegans

Pam passes the mailbox glances at it
CLOSE ON mailbox The side reads “The Ramseys”

BETTY (CONTD)
So do you think you will Pam

PAM
Do I think I will what

BETTY
Talk to the Keegans

PAM
Oh I don’t know I don’t even
know them

BETTY

that I’m mad at them I don’t even
want to get into why They called
me a C-U-N-T
(then excited)
You’re going to love it here
INT BEACH HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 6

Duncan sits on a bench Betty plants herself on a stool and
helps herself to a bag of POTATO CHIPS Trent makes a Mount
Gay and tonic Pam unfamiliar with the kitchen attempts to
put away groceries It’s a “trial by fire” project

BETTY
So how was your winter

Pam starts to respond but

BETTY (CONTD)
Because our year was a challenge
My niece was raped in October

PAM
Oh my goodness

BETTY

I know Not even food courts are
safe Oh and well Bob that’s my
ex-husband finally came out of the
closet Not a shock lLet’s just
say that in bed his favorite view
was the back of my head Now my
oldest Charlie is still into the
drugs and psychedelic music The
drugs I get But come on Gary
Garcia’s dead Let it go already

Betty laughs Pam glances at Trent mouthing the word
“Gary” Trent waves it off

BETTY (CONT’D)
(to Duncan)
Don’t do drugs Declan

DUNCAN
- Duncan

BETTY
(not hearing)
They’re just terrible Oh and
Susanna Well you saw She’s a
walking mood Going through an “I
hate my mother phase” Taking her
father’s side as usual

Steph enters wearing the tiniest of tiny bikinis

BETTY (CONT’D)
Oh Steph sweetie don’t you look
great

(MORE )
BETTY (CONTD)
That’s exactly the kind of suit
that got me pregnant the first

time
STEPH

That’s what I’m hoping for
TRENT

Hey
STEPH

(rolling her eyes)
I’m kidding

Steph grabs a beer from the six-pack on the counter Thrown
Pam glances at Trent who seems oblivious Pam takes her
look to Betty who commiserates

BETTY
I know I can’t drink beer
anymore either

(then grabbing her sides)

Look at these muffin tops Oh and
my youngest Peter He had
surgery to fix his lazy eye Now
it’s even worse I try to get him
to wear the eye patch so people
don’t feel uncomfortable But what
are you going to do

Steph shoves a couple more beers into her beach bag

STEPH
I’m outta here

TRENT
Oh hey take Duncan with you

Trent makes a point to look at Duncan encouraging

STEPH
Fuck that noise I told you I’m
not baby-sitting him all summer

TRENT
Youre taking Duncan with you
young lady

Duncan looks at his Mom “Do I not get a say”

PAM
(off Duncan)
Go to the beach sweetie
(MORE)

PAM (CONTD)
Youll have fun We’re just going
to be unpacking here

TRENT
(suggestive playful)
Well

Trent caresses Pam’s ass pulls her in and kisses her She
placates but is definitely blushing

BETTY

That’s our cue kids

(then)
Oh Now I am still having our
annual Fourth of July Clambake even
though Bob’s not here this year
He’s probably sucking off our
gardener right now Okay well

Betty exits taking the potato chips with her Duncan
glances at his mom hoping to be saved But she’s lost in
Trent

STEPH
You coming or what

Steph leaves Duncan shuffles out the door

EXT BEACH - WOODEN PATH - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 7

Steph strides along Duncan still in jeans and a T-shirt
lags behind

STEPH

over my head

EXT BEACH - DAY - A LITTLE LATER 8

Steph sits in the sand with her friends KATY and LAURA
Susanna is there as well reading Although the same age as
Steph Susanna has a maturity level that is leaps and bounds
beyond the rest of the girls Steph’s boyfriend (or “summer
friend”) CHAD is playing football with some GUYS nearby
Seated off to the side Duncan

LAURA
Oh hey just so you guys know my
house is out this year for
partying

STEPHKATY

KATY
What a selfish bitch

LAURA

STEPH

wants me to be happy

notices Duncan staring at them

STEPH

Steph walks off with Katy and Laura

LAURA
Where is that kid from anyway

STEPH
Albany He and his mom They live
in like a one bedroom apartment

LAURA KATY
Eww Tragic

STEPH
(noticing)
Uh Susanna We’re all swimming

Duncan watches Susanna reluctantly jump up join them

EXT BEACH - WOODEN PATH - DAY - A LITTLE LATER

Duncan heads back toward the houses From the opposite
direction Betty and her son PETER Clearly Betty has
transferred her cocktail to a Solo cup

BETTY
Duncan we were just coming to find
you This is Peter

PETER
Hey Duncan

DUNCAN
Hey

Betty wasn’t kidding Peter’s eye goes in every direction
Duncan doesn’t know where to look
BETTY
Oh just stare at the bridge of his
nose That’s what I do

PETER
Mom Are you shitting me

BETTY
Well if you wore the patch I
wouldn’t have to keep telling
people that would I Duncan I
was thinking that you and Peter
should hang out this summer Lord
knows he brought enough of his Star
Wars dolls You could have fun
with those

PETER
They’re action figures And
they’re classics
(then to Duncan)
I’ve got a rare wookie and the C-
3PO0 with detachable arms They
lose value if I take them out of
the boxes but we can still have
awesome battles with them

BETTY

He needs human contact He’s
having too many conversations with
those dolls

PETER
No I’m not

BETTY
I’ve heard you Peter You called
that “Baby Foot” or whatever your
best friend

PETER
(not worth the effort)
Boba Fett

BETTY
(ignoring to Duncan)
So should we set up a time for you
two to get together tomorrow

DUNCAN
Uh I should check with my mom

Duncan starts off

BETTY
(calling after)
Okay well don’t stand us up
because we know where you live
(then to Peter)
See I told you Your eye makes
people uncomfortable

PETER
You’re the worst parent

INTEXT BEACH HOUSE (FRONT) - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 10

Duncan enters From upstairs PLAYFUL LAUGHING Pam and
Trent are clearly fooling around With that Duncan turns
right around and heads back out

EXT STATION WAGON - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 11

Duncan is lying on top of the roof eyes closed listening to
his iPod Unfortunately he’s listening to REO Speedwagon’s
“Cant Fight This Feeling” AND he’s singing out loud

He opens his eyes to see

Susanna standing beside the car watching Clearly she’s
back from the beach Duncan fumbles with the iPod drops it
The earphones stay in the console falls to the ground
Embarrassed he looks over only to see that

She’s heading into her house

INT BEACH HOUSE - LIVING ROOMDINING ROOM - DAY - LATE 12
AFTERNOON

Duncan comes down the stairs Pam is setting the dining room
table for dinner Trent making drinks at the BAR With
them KIP and JOAN Trent’s friends “KYRIE” by MR MISTER
blares on the stereo (We hope) They’re all trying to sing
along but clearly don’t know the words Joan is dancing
occasionally tugging on Kip and Trent to join her But to
no avail The song gets to the CHORUS This part Trent
Kip and even Pam know well However

JOAN
(singing the chorus)
“Carry a laser down the road that I
must travel Carry a laser through
the darkness of the night”

KIP
(laughing shouting over
the music)
Whoa whoa Are you singing
“Carry a laser”

JOAN
That’s what it is

Trent Pam and Kip laugh

KIP
Why would anyone in their right
mind write a song called “Carry A
Laser”

JOAN
(laughing shrugging)
Because they love outer space

She goes back to singing and dancing Finally

JOAN (CONTD)
(noticing Duncan)
Uh-oh You just walked in at the
wrong time stranger

Before Duncan can even protest Joan is coaxing him onto her
“dance floor”

PAM
This is Duncan My son These are
Trent’s friends Kip and Joan

KIP
I’m the one not grinding up on you

JOAN
(laughing)
I’m not grinding up on him
(to Duncan)
Come on I can’t get anyone to
dance with me

Duncan looks to Pam for rescuing

PAM
(smirking)
Oh 1I’11 make it worse

Pam joins in Duncan halfheartedly gives in A lot of
awkward movement At this point everyone embraces the lyric
“Carry a laser” Full on singing

Save for Trent who puts on a good face but is clearly over
the moment Steph descends the stairs

STEPH
I’m out of here

PAM
Oh wait I made dinner

STEPH
Oh shoot I have plans

JOAN
Steph check out his moves

Steph watches for a short beat

STEPH
Enjoy therapy

She grabs beers off the bar and goes

TRENT
Alright we did that

Trent turns down the music Duncan self-conscious stops
dancing Pam grabs a PLATTER of HOR D’OURVES and BOX OF
CRACKERS places them on the COFFEE TABLE

TRENT (CONTD)
Hey buddy any chance you were on
top of my car

DUNCAN
«e- No

Without even being prompted Duncan helps Pam opening the
CRACKERS

TRENT
Cause there was a dent in the roof
It popped back up So it’s okay
I’m just wondering if you knew
anything about that

PAM
(innocent)
Well we did have bags up there
honey

Not the one he wanted to hear from but

TRENT
That’s true We did Fair enough

Trent smiles for Pam’s benefit

TRENT (CONT’D)
(pointed to Duncan)
So that’s probably it

He winks at Duncan

JOAN
Can I help you with this too Pam

PAM
Oh No Thank you
(then smiling at Duncan)
We’ve kind of got a system

Trent puts his arm around Pam

TRENT
We’ve got a good team here

He kisses her cheek He seems proud Duncan steps away
stops helping

13 INT BEACH HOUSE - DINING ROOM - THAT NIGHT 13

Post dinner Joan holding court Duncan pushes remnants of
food around on his plate

JOAN
No I can tell you exactly where I
was Passed out in the dunes

The guys laugh Pam is out of the loop but puts ona
gracious face

TRENT
That’s right

JOAN
Because you left me there

TRENT
No now wait Kip wanted to go out
on his boat He said youd be fine
by the fire

JOAN

PAM JOAN

Oh I’m sorry (faux sincere)

PAM

KIP
Yeah Enough of us reminiscing

PAM
It’s dumb

JOAN
Well now we have to hear it

PAM
(quickly)
One time I went to this luau and
passed out in the dunes too
That’s basically it

Dead air A flop of a story But everyone feigns enjoyment
to ease the awkwardness for Pam

JOAN
(passively)
-- Oh how funny

PAM
It was just A similar thing
to

Trent pulls in Pam close He’s very attracted to this side
of her Kip starts piling more food onto his plate

KIP
Okay I just have to point out that
I’m loading up for the third time
Pam absolutely incredible

PAM

KIP
No thank you
(re Trent)
Sorry this asshole sprung us on
you last minute

PAM

cooking for people

JOAN

Joan takes a sip of her wine smiles

TRENT
One of her many talents

Trent kisses her Pam smiles graciously She’s not used to
being put on a pedestal It shows

TRENT (CONTD)
She’s also got some ideas for
fixing up the place

KIP
You mean
(playing it up)
- the “Riptide”

Trent laughs deflects He takes a lot of shit for this

PAM
(clarifying)
I mentioned rearranging a few
things

TRENT
Hey Put your stamp on it I’m
not set in my ways

JOAN
(scoffing)
Tell that to Christine

Kip lightly nudges Joan A little awkward silence then

PAM
(moving on)
Okay I’m sorry I have to put my
son out of his misery
(MORE)

Al4

PAM (CONTD)
(to Duncan)
Youre free to go

With that Duncan jumps up from the table Finally relief

TRENT
But take your plate buddy We
clean up after ourselves in this
house

Duncan complies as Trent pours Pam some more wine She
watches her son head off to the KITCHEN as

JOAN
Okay My story now Trent was it
last summer that you and I got
stuck out on our boat

TRENT
(pointing to Kip)
Yes cause this bastard buys gas
three dollars at a time

They all laugh and continue to reminisce

INT BEACH HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT 14
Duncan looks around aimlessly for anything to pass the time

- Surveys the BOOKCASES Slim pickings Mostly Louis
L’Amour-type novels

- Checks out a PLAQUE It’s engraved “Trent Ramsey Car
Salesman of the Year”

- Looks at FRAMED PHOTOS One catches his eye A GROUP
SHOT Among them Trent Kip Joan and Betty AND there’s
one WOMAN of interest While everyone else is looking at the
CAMERA she’s looking at Trent But she’s turned at such an
angle that we can’t see much of her face if any at all
Hanging onto her Steph smiling at the CAMERA

- Opens a CABINET Practically empty save for one old
ratty edition of CANDYLAND and a 500 PIECE PUZZLE (Something
lame like kittens in a basket)

INT BEACH HOUSE - DUNCAN’S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT Al4

Duncan sits on the FLOOR In front of him the almost
completed PUZZLE Just two pieces left to put in He looks
around Shakes the box No pieces to be found Sighs and
just starts taking it apart

EXT BEACH HOUSE - BACK DECK - LATER THAT NIGHT 15
Duncan walks out looks out over the dunes

BETTY (0S)

Susanna close the screen door

mosquitos

Duncan looks over at the adjacent deck noticing Susanna
sitting in a lounge chair She gets up slams the screen
door shut

BETTY (0S) (CONT’D)

DUNCAN
(trying to play it off)
Something like that
We hear LOUD LAUGHTER from inside Trent’s house

SUSANNA

DUNCAN
(shrugging)
It’s okay

SUSANNA

DUNCAN

INT BEACH HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 18

Duncan enters It’s a mess Everything left out from the
night before Clearly not everyone cleans up after
themselves Steph is there scavenging the fridge

STEPH
They drank all the beer

She slams the fridge door storms out Duncan finds a 20
BILL on the COUNTER Next to it a NOTE It reads “Up
late Sleeping in Love you Mom”

EXT BEACH HOUSE (FRONT) - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 19
Duncan walks down the stairs

BETTY (0S)
Peter don’t get mad at me I
don’t know where you’re looking

Duncan stops in his tracks Shit
ANGLE ON Betty and Peter at the base of their front STAIRS

PETER
Forget it It’s gone

BETTY
Well next time you say “Look at
the seagull” you have to remember
to point

Duncan quickly runs around the side of the STORAGE SHED
opens it A BIKE leans against the back wall but we can’t
quite make it out

EXT STREET - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 20

Duncan rides the bike A girl’s PINK CRUISER complete with
front basket and tassels But he doesn’t care For the
first time he seems content

EXT MARC ANTHONY’S - DAY - LATER 21
It’s a PIZZA JOINT A cool old school vibe Duncan leans

the BIKE against the wall Parked at the CURB the
Convertible we saw earlier

INT MARC ANTHONY’S - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 22

Duncan is at the COUNTER buying a SOFT DRINK Behind him a
table of rowdy GUYS all in BLUE SHIRTS eating pizza We
hear the familiar MUSIC of a PAC MAN GAME starting Duncan’s
attention is drawn to the

BACK GAME ROOM Another BLUE-SHIRTED GUY is playing Pac Man
EXCEPT for the classic PAC MAN upright the rest of the video
games are very 2012 Duncan approaches standing right
behind the Guy watching

GUY
Do you mind standing to the side
I’m getting your reflection in the
screen

DUNCAN
Sorry

Duncan steps to the side As he does we get our first good
look at the guy It is in fact the DRIVER of the
convertible

CLOSE ON LOGO It reads “Water Wizz”

GUY
I wouldn’t normally care but I’m
having the game of my life I’m oon
the cherry level

DUNCAN
But that’s the first level

GUY
Yeah and I still have one man
left So like I said it’s the
game of my life

DUNCAN
(smirks )
You like Pac Man

GUY
What It’s a classic
(re other games)
Not into all the bells and
whistles my man Too much going
on

CLOSE ON Pac Man screen Pac Man chases a “blinking ghost”
barely devouring it before it changes back

GUY (CONTD)
See my mistake is that I get
greedy Going for all the ghosts
and fruit instead of just clearing
pellets

DUNCAN
You know there’s a pattern

GUY
Oh don’t tell me you’re one of
those guys That takes all the
challenge out of it Anybody can
learn a pattern

Just then the blue-shirted GUYS start to get up putting up
their TRAYS

BLUE-SHIRTED GUY
Owen we gotta go

We hear the familiar sound of PAC MAN DYING

OWEN (GUY)
Well so much for the game of my
life

DUNCAN

You still have another man left

OWEN
Naw I’ve yet to see the second
board Gives me something to look
forward to

DUNCAN

Owen starts to walk away

OWEN (CONTD)

EXT BEACH HOUSE - DAY - LATER 23

Duncan pulls up on his bike Pam and Trent are loading a
large COOLER into the station wagon Steph leaning against
the car putting on suntan lotion

PAM

DUNCAN
(shrugging)
Nowhere

PAM
Well let’s leave notes okay

TRENT

the edge of the boat

TRENT
You need to wear that

KIP
Oh I think he’s cool without it

TRENT
No Duncan can’t swim

PAM
(trying to make it better
clarifying)
Trent he’s just not a comfortable
swimmer
KIP

I really think he’1ll be fine

TRENT
No let’s wear it buddy So
people don’t have to worry about
you right

Everyone is
loading stuff onto a large motor boat all tricked out
Trent stands on

BETTY (0S)
Yoo hoo

Betty walks down the dock followed by Peter who’s carrying
a BUCKET and Susanna

BETTY (CONTD)
Yes we invited ourselves Accept
it and move on Peter has to stay
down below His eye throws off his
equilibrium and hell get sick
everywhere

PETER
No I won’t mom

BETTY
Tell that to the bucket we have to
bring

Duncan reluctantly puts on the vest

DUNCAN
(sotto to Pam)
Why do I have to wear this No one
else does

PAM
He just wants you to be safe

Susanna walks by lifting an eyebrow as Pam tightens the
straps on his vest

PAM (CONT’D)
Is that snug enough

Off Duncan’s look

EXT BOAT - DAY - LATER 25

CLOSE ON Duncan sitting He’s miserable The life vest is
three sizes too big for him It comes halfway up his face

The adults sit around the STERN of the boat Steph and
Susanna sunbathe on the BOW

CLOSE ON a beat up COOLER Pam opens revealing her “work”
Impeccable food It outclasses the container for sure

PAM
Basically he was relentless And
don’t get me wrong I was looking
(MORE)

PAM (CONTD)
I had been divorced well over a
year It just

TRENT
It just took a little persistence
on my end

Pam smiles caresses Trent’s cheek Pam sets out her dishes
creating a spread on a table Kip starts helping himself
instantly to the annoyance of Joan

PAM
Well I wasn’t sure about you

TRENT
I met her when she was catering
some Halloween party in Albany

PAM
(teasing)
He went as a sexy cop

TRENT
(laughing defending)
No I was a 70s bad ass cop

PAM
He followed me around all night
saying that he was there to
“protect and serve” me

Trent playfully tries to put his hand over Pam’s mouth but
she pulls away

PAM (CONTD)
That about ended it right there for
me

BETTY
(sotto to adults)
Sadly I would have been working
his bag by that point

TRENT
(to Pam)
Now you did let me help you load
up your van at the end of the
night

PAM
Yes I did

TRENT
But it still took three months to
even get her to go out with me

He pulls Pam in

BETTY
Three months I didn’t know you
had that kind of stamina

TRENT
She definitely made me work for it
But it was worth it

BETTY
There may be hope for you yet

JOAN
(to Pam)
What finally changed your mind

PAM
He told me that we were already in
this together so I might as well
It’s been almost a year now

They kiss Joan finishes her wine Trent Kip and Betty
start to make plates for themselves Pam notices Duncan
sulking

ANGLE ON DUNCAN He glances over at Steph and Susanna
Steph catches him She nudges Susanna whispers They both
laugh Duncan fumes

Pam approaches
PAM (CONTD)
(light jokingly)
Could you look a little more
miserable

DUNCAN
Could he be even more of a dick

Pam’s smile instantly fades

PAM
Hey He’s making an effort

Duncan looks away
PAM (CONTD)

He wants this to work He wants us
to be a family

A27

DUNCAN
He says that but that’s not what
he does

PAM

Look I know it’s not easy but
You promised remember That you’d
give it a try

DUNCAN
I don’t know why I can’t just go to
dad’s for the summer

Pam puts on a good face moving through

PAM
Because you’re with me

Duncan just looks off checks out He doesn’t “feel” like
he’s with her Eventually Pam returns to the group

EXT DOCKS - DAY - LATE AFTERNOON 26

Everyone is unloading Trent is helping the women off the
boat offering them a hand as they step down Duncan jumps
onto the dock throws off his life preserver

down Trent offers his hand She makes a point to reject
it getting down on her own

Duncan finds Owen standing on a SMALL DECK over the MAIN
OFFICE He’s in a ratty BATHROBE eating breakfast

OWEN (CONTD)

protect

CAITLIN a fellow coworker emerges from the MAIN OFFICE

the place

CAITLIN

CELLPHONE Duncan seems to be holding onto a little
resentment from the boat incident He doesn’t even get off
his bike Just circles around and around in the street

DUNCAN
Oh it’s not mine

SUSANNA
Yeah I figured

Susanna walks down to the street smiles But she can’t
help but register Duncan’s aloofness She tries another
tactic

SUSANNA (CONTD)

You were right by the way It is
a hot summer

Duncan stops reluctantly smiles

DUNCAN
Yeah I just call it like I see it

SUSANNA
(holding up phone)

TRENT
Hey Duncan

Duncan stops Beat

TRENT (CONT’D)
I’m not interested in talking to
the back of your head so

Duncan turns around full of 14 year old attitude

TRENT (CONTD)
If we’re going to make this work
and it is “we” then there needs to
be trust And respect Am I
right I think that’s something we
both want

DUNCAN
Fine

TRENT
There you go buddy

Duncan turns and heads upstairs

38 EXT WATERPARK - EMPLOYEE LOUNGE - THE NEXT DAY 38

OWEN (0S)
I’m afraid I’m going to have to ask
you to leave

Duncan looks back over his shoulder

DUNCAN
- What

OWEN
Yeah you’re going to have to take
off I’m getting complaints
You’re having too much fun It’s
making everyone uncomfortable

DUNCAN
Oh Okay

Duncan actually gets up starts out Owen is genuinely
thrown by Duncan’s reaction Stifles a laugh

OWEN
Whoa Wait
(laughs)
I’m sorry I shouldn’t be I
didn’t think you would actually

Duncan’s not sure what’s going on Owen gathers himself He
found that very endearing and funny

OWEN (CONTD)
(gesturing him to follow)
Come on

Duncan seems reticent More confused really

OWEN (CONT’D)
Look I can tell you’re in complete
awe of that picnic table It is
one-of-a-kind except for the 200
exactly like it around here But
there is more park to be seen

Finally Duncan complies follows

OWEN (CONT’D)
First things first As much as I’m
a fan of Tuff Skins we’ve got to
get you a swimsuit Seriously

jeans

DUNCAN
Oh my mom buys my jeans

OWEN

for you You getting laid

EXT WATERPARK - RENTAL BOOTH - DAY 39

Owen and Duncan approach LEWIS working behind the counter
He’s quite a curmudgeon pale as can be and his Water Wizz
employee shirt is WAY too big for him

OWEN
Lewis hook up my man Duncan here
with one of our finest rentals

LEWIS
Some kid threw up near Crazy Tubes

OWEN
Whoa let’s try not to impress him
all at once

LEWIS
That will not be a challenge

OWEN
Lewis is kind of over this place

LEWIS
I told you I’m not long for here

OWEN
No I remember that conversation
In 2003 5 11 April two days
ago

LEWIS
I’ve just got things I want to do

OWEN
Prove it Without thinking rattle

think you have to go to school for

that
LEWIS
(scoffing)
“Hey look There’s a storm”
“Where” “Over there” “Cool

OWEN

Wait Are you chasing them or
capturing

Lewis waves him off pulls out a pair of ragged-looking swim
trunks from below the counter hands them to Duncan

LEWIS
These don’t have any mesh so
youre basically going “commando”
Watch sitting You’re junk will
fall out

OWEN
And like that you’re impressed
And grossed out

Off Duncan

EXT WATERPARK - BUZZARD’S BAY GIFT SHOP - MOMENTS LATER
DAY

We STEADY CAM as Owen leads Duncan now wearing the ill-
fitting swim suit on a “tour of the park” This is our
first real glimpse of Water Wizz in all its glory Clearly
built in the 80’s and from the looks of it hasn’t changed a
bit

OWEN
Water Wizz Waterpark Built in the
summer of ‘83 it’s the last
bastion of everything that time
period stood for In fact it was
decreed by its creator that this
place shall never age On his
death bed he said “I don’t want
this place re-painted or updated I
don’t even want it brought up to
code And the minute someone
tries it needs to be destroyed”

Duncan doesn’t even bat an eye to this Owen takes that in
OWEN (CONT’D)
We actually have a nuclear bomb for
just such an occasion

Duncan still doesn’t get the joke

OWEN (CONTD)
Bought it off the Russians

Still nothing
OWEN (CONTD)
Really Still good with all that
Even the Russian thing That’s
Cold War Kind of dated
Duncan’s still blank
OWEN (CONTD)
Okay Well that was a waste of a
bit

Caitlin joins them clipboard in hand

CAITLIN
Some kid threw up near Crazy Tubes
OWEN
(faux pissed)
Why is this the first I’m hearing

We CUT to a CAMERA on a SCISSOR LIFT as Owen and the rest
continue up the STAIRS

JASON (CONTD)
Neil says that years ago some kid
figured out how to pass someone on
the water slide Is that true

NEIL
He did

KYLE
It’s physically impossible Neil
You can’t catch up to someone and
pass them

OWEN
Actually Ming Lee’s right I was
here when it happened

JASON
Then how’d he do it

OWEN
It happened inside the tube So
no one knows Only the kid and the
person he passed And well
Jesus But he’s hard to get a
hold of

NEIL
Be serious

KYLE
Don’t interrupt him Neil He was
talking

We CUT to STEADY CAM as they climb some stairs onto a SMALL
LANDING

OWEN
Guys what happens in the tube
stays in the tube That’s just the
law of the park

KYLE
Bullshit We’1ll just ask the kid
how he did it

OWEN
Be my guest If you can find him
Last I heard he went into a deep
depression The fame was too much
(MORE )
OWEN (CONTD)
He turned to cocaine to escape the
limelight And eventually to a
life of male prostitution

Owen stops on the landing

OWEN (CONTD)
Oh no Wait There he is

Owen points at a VERY YOUNG KID Couldn’t be more than

(nodding her head)
PTA meeting You can imagine
how that conversation went “I’m
concerned about safety in our
school Violence is on the rise”
“That’s not all that’s on the
rise”

Betty imitates “porn music” They all laugh

BETTY (CONTD)
(getting up re glass)

all these useless facts about ghost
crabs Like did you know they’re
omnivorous Basically they feed
on both animals and vegetables

(then)
My mom jokes “Leave it to your dad
to be interested in a creature that
goes both ways”

Duncan can’t help but smile Beat

SUSANNA (CONTD)
Good night

DUNCAN
(coming to)

Susanna head up the stairs Duncan continues into Trent’s
YARD Suddenly MUFFLED ARGUING from the side of the house
draws his attention to

-- the side of TRENT’S HOUSE Duncan peeks around Joan
clearly drunk is leaning into Trent She runs her hand up
his stomach and chest Trent removes her hand but she leans
in kisses him Although Trent doesn’t “kiss back” he
doesn’t pull away immediately Thinking better of it he
finally turns his head away

JOAN
Oh I see Just not this summer

Pissed she waves him off Trent starts walking toward
Duncan who throws himself against the side of the house
Trent walks by not seeing him In his hand a bag of
MARSHMALLOWS Trent approaches Pam and the rest

PAM
You were gone that long and you
only brought the marshmallows

TRENT
Joan has the rest

Trent joins Kip and Charlie who are clearly smoking pot
Duncan watches as Pam looks over her shoulder in the
direction of where Trent came from just as Joan is rounding
the corner fixing her hair Joan joins them at the fire
handing a box of GRAHAM CRACKERS and CHOCOLATE BARS to Pam
without even looking at her Pam glances over noticing
Duncan She takes a moment then

PAM
(to Group upbeat)
Who wants a S’more

Duncan just shakes his head and walks off

EXT WATERPARK - RENTAL BOOTH - THE NEXT MORNING 52

Duncan rounds the corner of the booth a little out of sorts
from the night before But at least he’s in his OWN
swimsuit Owen is there with Lewis

OWEN

OWEN

Owen throws him a blue shirt Duncan doesn’t emote much
excitement

OWEN (CONT’D)
Come on get pumped This is a
place where dreams are made Or
destroyed Depends on how you feel
about working at a waterpark

Duncan puts the blue shirt on over his T-shirt Caitlin
approaches

CAITLIN
Um we have a situation over at
Harpoon Lagoon

OWEN
(dead serious)
Is it a homicide

CAITLIN
(dry)
Yes It’s a homicide That’s why
I’m so calm

Owen starts off

OWEN
(dramatic whisper)
I knew this day would come

Caitlin and Duncan follow

EXT WATERPARK - HARPOON LAGOON - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 53

A small crowd of waterpark PATRONS have circled up watching
some BREAKDANCERS going to town on a large piece of
CARDBOARD HIP-HOP BLARING from a BOOM BOX (NOTE Our
“Breakdancers” are just TEENS who were at the waterpark Not
a “crew” They would be dressed for the waterpark)

ANGLE ON SNACK SHACK Roddy and a few other EMPLOYEES are
watching Owen Caitlin and Duncan approach joining

OWEN
(disappointed)
Oh There’s no blood

RODDY

(very matter-of-fact)
They grabbed some cardboard from
the snack shack and just started
going to town Mostly b-boying
Power Abstract Blowup Flavor
Mad moves though Applejacks
Coindrops Turtles Jackhammers
1990s

OWEN
Any Jookin Buckin

RODDY
(scoffing)
Not this far from Memphis

CAITLIN
(over it)
Someone needs to take away their
cardboard It’s getting too
congested

OWEN
(to Duncan)
You heard the lady

DUNCAN
(taken aback)
- Oh I don’t

CAITLIN
No Owen You need to do this

OWEN
Naw he’s got it

Duncan looks over nervous

DUNCAN’S POV of the BREAKDANCING CIRCLE A BREAKDANCING GUY
moves center stage holding court He’s quite an imposing
fellow

DUNCAN
(meek)
But It’s my first day

OWEN
(off shirt)
Hey You’re official now You got

this

Duncan takes a deep breath walks off

OWEN (CONTD)
(off Caitlin’s glare)
I’m right here I’11 step in

ANGLE ON Duncan slowly approaching He stops just outside
the circle looks back at Owen who gives him a thumbs up

DUNCAN
(soft)
-- Excuse me

No one hears him over the music They’re lost in their dance
circle

DUNCAN (CONTD)
Hey uh guys

Nothing Duncan shuffles over to the boom box turns it off
A smattering of disappointment from the Patrons “Boo”

BREAKDANCERS
HeyWhat the hell

They all turn and look right at Duncan

DUNCAN
I’m gonna need to take your
cardboard

BREAKDANCING GUY
Whoa whoa

Our imposing fellow steps forward Duncan’s eyes only come
up to his chest

BREAKDANCING GUY (CONT’D)
What now

DUNCAN
Um I was told to take your
cardboard

The Breakdancing Guy takes a moment but eventually steps to

the side Duncan makes his way through the very intimidating
crowd He reaches down grabs the edge of the cardboard A

foot SLAMS down onto it It’s Breakdancing Guy again

BREAKDANCING GUY
Show us your moves

Duncan looks at him confused

BREAKDANCING GUY (CONT’D)
Show us your moves Then you can
take it

DUNCAN
Oh I don’t I can’t um
crunk or any of that

BREAKDANCING GUY
Then you can’t take the cardboard

He takes a moment then starts to “pop ‘n lock” horribly
It’s awkward and jerky This moment seems to go on for an
eternity Finally he stops No one reacts They all just
stare at him blankly Beat

BREAKDANCING GUY (CONT’D)
(nodding head)
Okay Okay

He seems to be signing off Duncan relieved goes to
retrieve the cardboard

FEMALE VOICE (0S)
Whoa We’re not done

ANGLE ON a BEAUTIFUL BREAKDANCER emerging from the crowd
She turns the BOOM BOX back on Grabs Duncan’s hand leading
him to the center of the cardboard

BEAUTIFUL BREAKDANCER
Just mirror me

The Beautiful Breakdancer does a move throws it to Duncan
He tries to replicate it Terrible More moves More
mirroring More butchering The Patrons start to get into
it

BREAKDANCING GUY
Spin on your head

Just then two big BREAKDANCERS pick Duncan up from behind
flip him over Duncan is now in a headstand The
Breakdancers start manually spinning Duncan by his legs
faster and faster handing him off like a Tetherball

CLOSE ON Duncan’s face beaming

DUNCANS POV as he spins around and around

Suddenly the guys let go Duncan tumbles to the ground

BREAKDANCERS
Stick it Stick it

Duncan awkwardly makes a “pose” The Patrons go crazy
Breakdancing Guy helps Duncan up Everyone clapscheers
including Owen and Roddy Even Caitlin is not immune to the
moment

BREAKDANCING GUY
Nice moves Pop ‘n Lock

The Beautiful Breakdancer hands Duncan the cardboard
ANGLE ON OwenCaitlin He gives her a “See” look

CAITLIN
You got lucky

Owen puts his arm around her waist but she removes it

ANGLE ON Duncan carrying the CARDBOARD back over grinning
He’s also DIZZY AS HELL He can barely walk a straight line
In fact as he tumbles off to the side

There is in fact a “bridge” that allows you to jump ahead
Duncan moves his “character” over the “bridge”

TRENT
Whoa No he can’t do that
PAM
Yes he can He crosses the
bridge
DUNCAN

(under his breath)
This is so stupid

Duncan moves back and past the “bridge”

PAM
No youre at the shortcut So
take it

Trent picks up the DIRECTIONS

TRENT

(reading pointedly)
“If your Gingerbread Character pawn
lands by exact count on the
yellow space below the Gumdrop
Pass you can take the shortcut”

(then)
“Exact count” He picked a card
with a blue square on it so he has
to go to a blue square

PAM
Well I don’t think it matters

TRENT
If it didn’t matter they wouldn’t
put it in the directions

PAM
We can fudge the rule

STEPH
(laughs)
“Fudge” That’s good

TRENT
(good-natured)
Well then I might as well go
directly to the top of Candy
Mountain with that argument

Trent moves his pawn

TRENT (CONTD)

checks in with him but his gaze is set on the water

SUSANNA
I told you this place sucks

Susanna smiles hoping to break the ice No luck

SUSANNA (CONT’D)
I talked to my dad today I told
him that we had chased ghost crabs
It made him very happy Felt like
he was here “Did you tell him
about the eyes You’ve got to
tell him about their eyes” He
gets so excited

Still nothing from Duncan She pushes on

SUSANNA (CONT’D)

See their eyes can rotate 360
degrees They can see everything
around them But they can’t look
straight up Which makes it easy
for birds to attack them So they
have to gather food at night for
safety

(then shrugging)
I don’t know My dad finds it
cool He’s a dork

Finally Duncan looks at Susanna who smiles Impulsively
he leans in tries to kiss her Caught off guard she pulls

back
