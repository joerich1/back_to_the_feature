The Hunt Continues

SLOW FADE-IN FROM BLACK

OPENING TITLE SEQUENCE

RUSHING FORWARD at ground level mottled shapes racing past
camera slowly resolving into trees CAMERA RISING into an

AERIAL VIEW speeding on looking down on a jungle canopy

We slow and CRANE UP cresting the treeline the startling

sight of the LOS ANGELES BASIN appearing before us Title

BLEEDS INTO

PREDATOR VISION OF LOS ANGELES

Scanning the skyline Attracted by a strange distant SOUND
his vision STEPS IN downward through the canyons of steel
the distorted WHINE of a SIREN growing louder as the
Predator’s vision ZOOMS IN to rest on a bizarre scene below

a loping YELLOW wave of FLAME accompanied by distorted SOUNDS
of CRACKLING and POPPING blood-red STREAKS of LIGHT darting
across the street Suddenly a mushrooming BALL OF HEAT rushes
towards us

EXT OBJECTIVE CAMERA HIGH ANGLE MIDSTREET DAY

As a BOBTAIL TRUCK EXPLODES into flames nearly enveloping

a latemodel CADILLAC abandoned nose-first onto the sidewalk
The keening WAIL grows louder as we DESCEND through the thick
smog and shimmering air of a blistering heat-wave into the
midst of a raging BATTLEFIELD

Behind the truck TEN MEN heavily armed with AUTOMATIC RIFLES
and SHOTGUNS lay down a barrage of GUNFIRE aimed at EIGHT
POLICEMEN across the street pinned down in doorways
stairwells and behind cars

In the center of the street are two POLICE MOTORCYCLES
literally chewed to pieces by gunfire Two OFFICERS lie in
the street both bleeding heavily and barely alive

Further down the street a BLOCKADE of POLICE CARS has been
established A POLICEMAN dressed in bomb-disposal armour and
helmet is handed a fold-out BALLISTICS SHIELD resembling a
cattle-catcher on a train

The officer heads into the firezone moving towards the
downed officers bullet hits raking the shield

From behind the truck a GUNMAN emerges to FIRE an M79
GRENADE LAUNCHER at the cop the EXPLOSION warping the shield
throwing the cop backwards into the street leaving him
unconscious

EXT POLICE LINE - MEDIA BARRIER - DAY 4

A block beyond the fire zone where a DOZEN MINI-CAM CREWS
are sequestered the CAMERAMEN jockeying for position
training their telephoto lenses on the action It could be
a scene from the streets of Beirut

We MOVE PAST FOUR REPORTERS hunkered down behind CARS and
VANS offering frantic running commentary to their live TV

viewers their dialogue overlapping

REPORTER 1 REPORTER 2

As drought-ridden Los Eyewitness-5 on the scene
Angeles swelters into For the second time today we’re
it’s fifty-ninth day in a war-zone Dave Two officers
of 107 degree weather down heavy weapons fire bullets
yet another open everywhere the police seemingly
confrontation between unable to gain control of the
drug lords and city police situation What apparently began
has erupted thirty minutes ago as a routine

traffic citation has now éscalated

REPORTER 3
» just moments ago as police were
attempting a daring rescue of the
downed officers a tremendous
explosion rocked the streets
Perhaps a grenade we don’t know
just that another officer is down

We HOLD ON TONY POPE the peacock of guerilla-journalism the
Geraldo Revera of the streets Two ASSISTANTS a Mutt and
Jeff combo dressed in 90’s retro-hip threads handle the
VIDEO-CAM and the sound as Pope blazes away with his
commentary

POPE
Tony Pope live with ’Hard-Core’
on the scene and in your home with
another exclusive report It’s a
scene from Dante’s hell blistering
heat fire and smoke the screams
of dying men filling the streets as
vicious drug lords continue to
terrorize Los Angeles waging open
warfare for control of the streets
Just who the hell is in charge

Third Draft 011690 3

POPE (Cont’d)
Certainly not the cops who are
outgunned outmanned and incompetent
to handle the situation Isn’t it
time the mayor hiding out in his
summer home in Lake Tahoe declare
marshall law bring in the national
guard and put an end to this
slaughter

The increasing WAIL of a SIREN overtakes the scene as an
unmarked POLICE CAR races towards the barricade Pope pushes
the camera forcing it to track the car as it clips a NEWS
RACK before leaping onto the sidewalk accelerating towards
the police line

5 EXT POLICE LINE - FIRE ZONE - DAY

Where a SERGEANT and several OFFICERS kneel behind the patrol
cars further protected by portable BALLISTIC SHIELDS They
turn as the patrol car SCREECHES to a stop

Emerging from the car is DETECTIVE-LIEUTENANT MIKE HARRIGAN
mid-thirties sweat-soaked white shirt necktie askew a huge
longframed SHOULDER HOLSTER slung under his arm Harrigan
is the ‘whip’ of Metro Command - the field commander

Harrigan makes his way across the street towards the
barricade followed by LEONA CANTRELL strong handsome the
stride of an athlete the purposeful countenance of one born
and raised on the streets She wears on her hip a SMITH and
WESSON REVOLVER with a custom grip

At her side is DANIEL (’DANNY’) CUTTER 37 a tall raw-boned
man Harrigan’s childhood buddy and police partner for fifteen
years

Harrigan approaches the SERGEANT crouching beside him By
the way his eyes scan the street we realize this man’s
lifestyle has been forged in the no-quarter-given arena of the
streets This is one smart tough COP

HARRIGAN
Don’t keep me in suspense Sergeant

SERGEANT
Bad scene Lieutenant Two motors
pulled over a truck stumbled right
into a narc stakeout Ten
Colombians El Scorpios armed to
fuck all

Third Draft 011690 4

SERGEANT (Cont’d)
They’re trying to get inside that
building their headquarters
Keepin’ ‘em pinned down but those
officers are bleedin’ to death

Harrigan looks over the top of the cars towards the wounded
men on the street

HARRIGAN
Where the hell is Special Weapons

SERGEANT
Still tied up in that shootout in
San Pedro Bastards shot down one
ef our choppers Real mess We’re
suckin’ hind tit ‘’til they get here
But Mills and Johnson won’t last much
longer We need an assault vehicle
to get to ‘em

Harrigan studies the fire zone for a moment the dying
officers then signals to Danny and Leona to approach

HARRIGAN
I’m gonna go ‘chat’ with these
assholes

He grabs a SHOTGUN from an officer giving it to Danny

HARRIGAN
When I give the signal give me a
little cover

Danny racks a round into the chamber

DANNY
You got it

Harrigan opens the trunk of his car riffling through several
CANVAS BAGS an arsenal of WEAPONS visible He selects a
cut-down ASSAULT SHOTGUN checks the action and slams shut
the trunk

Harrigan jumps into his car tossing the shotgun on the seat
Holding the driver’s door open he PEELS OUT in reverse over
the sidewalk aiming the open door at a TELEPHONE POLE The
impact rips the door off which slides across the sidewalk

The patrol car locks up sliding past the officers jerking
to a halt providing cover between the dying officers and the
Colombians

Two POLICEMEN run from the street dragging the officers to
safety Harrigan shotgun in hand sprinting low to the
ground heading for the Cadillac

SIX of the Colombians race for their headquarters firing
behind them their escape covered by Harrigan’ Ss car The
officers on the street jockey for new positions firing as
five of the Colombians make it through the door the STXTH
cut down in a hail of bullets from Danny and Leona now

charging down the street

Harrigan rolls over the Cadillac dropping down behind the
open driver’s door He rises catching the remaining four
Colombians off guard They swing their weapons to fire but
Harrigan is faster the 10 gauge slugs ripping huge holes

through the door the four Colombians blown off their feet

PREDATOR‘S POV OF HARRIGAN 13

ZOOMING-IN on him standing in the alley smoke pouring from
the shotgun But the Predator is attracted by a SOUND
turning upward to SEE a HELICOPTER HEAT-SWIRLS flowing from
the turbines looking like some gigantic insect A TRILL
emerges from the Predator as suddenly he turns HIS VISION
ZOOMING IN on the doorway where the five Colombians escaped
Another TRILL as he MOVES

EXT STREET - FIRE ZONE DAY 14

Harrigan emerges from the alley police rushing from every
direction looking at the BLACK HELICOPTER circling high
above Harrigan tosses the empty shotgun into his car
drawing the long-slide 45 MAGNUM AUTOMATIC from his shoulder
holster Danny and Leona race into view

Leona

INT LOFT COLOMBIAN’S HQ DAY 15

An ARSENAL dingy brick-walled illuminated by skylights
twenty feet above windows shuttered by boilerplate open
steel CABINETS lining the walls racks of WEAPONS inside
Cases of AMMUNITION are stacked on the floor

The four Colombians all wearing TATTOOS of SCORPIONS are
SHOUTING at each other in rapid-fire SPANISH as they break
out a variety of HEAVY WEAPONS an M60 MACHINE GUN M-203
GRENADE LAUNCHERS AK47s HandK MP-5’s and ASSAULT SHOTGUNS
The Colombians are enraged crazed as they jam clips into the
weapons From a pile of BULLET PROOF VESTS one of the men
begins to suit up This is going to be a fight to the death

The leader a scorpion TATTOO wrapped around his left eye and
wearing a heavy gold SCORPION on a gold chain slams a CLIP
into his weapon He bends the tail on the scorpion around
his neck revealing a cavity filled with cocaine He holds
it to his nose snorting heavily

EL SCORPIO
(screaming)
Come and get it putos El Scorpio
is ready

But from overhead an earsplitting CRASH fills the room a
shower of GLASS descanding on the men As stunned faces turn
upward in SLOW-MOTION we HEAR the chilling TRILL of the
Predator’s challenge

EXT STREET - DOWNTOWN LA DAY 16

Suddenly the faint but distinct staccato STUTTER of AUTOMATIC
WEAPONS FIRE erupts from the upper stories of the building

a STEEL SHUTTER blown from the wall by a 40 MM GRENADE
Everyone takes cover except Harrigan who looks up at the
building

HARRIGAN
(quizzically)
What the Sarge any of your
people in the building

SERGEANT

No

Lieutenant I can’t send anyone in

HARRIGAN
Well Heinemann can kiss my sweet

As Harrigan Leona and Danny head for the building the
sergeant in frustration gestures to two of his OFFICERS
wearing BODY ARMOUR

SERGEANT
God damn-it go with him

The two officers charge after the three detectives

INT WAREHOUSE - LANDING - TOP FLOOR - DAY 17

Dark narrow corridors blistered green paint clinging to

concrete walls stained and threadbare carpeting Harrigan
Leona Danny and the two officers cautiously make their way
up the stairs and onto the landing weapons drawn alert for

any sound faces dripping sweat

Harrigan the intense highly tuned warrior senses the air
for some clue some movement He turns to Danny their eyes
meeting Danny’s asking ‘Where’ Harrigan aware of
something the others haven’t yet sensed turns his eyes to

a door on the left He creeps forward placing his hand on
the wall feeling He nods

Danny signals to the others who take up positions around the
door Danny gently tries the doorknob indicating it’s
locked Harrigan nods leveling the huge 45 Danny in one
fluid motion kicks opens the door hitting the floor as
Harrigan swings in over the top eyes searching the room
weapons bearing down on

at least ten Latin WOMEN huddling terrified like rabbits
berieath their SEWING MACHINES piles of UNDERGARMENTS in
various stages of completion proclaiming the room a sweatshop

A momentary look of relief as Danny gains his feet And then
as if hit by a locomotive the door behind them explodes open
one of the Colombians charging into the hallway two AUTOMATIC
WEAPONS in either hand FIRING back into the room

A moment of total confusion as the Colombian covered in
blood SCREAMING INCOHERENTLY eyes wide with panic smashes
into one of the officers knocking him to the floor the
raking GUNFIRE as he spins hitting the other officer sending
him down the staircase

As the others hit the deck Leona EMPTIES her revolver
several shots going wild three hits impacting the madman’s
body armour sending him reeling against the wall He
recovers charging down the hallway and up a stairwell
Oblivious to the danger Harrigan chases after him shouting
to the others

HARRIGAN
Take the room

The other officer is on his RADIO calling for backup

RETURN TO SCENE 20

As Harrigan clears the doorway eyes moving scanning seeing
the fleeing Colombian He runs after him

The Colombian reaches the edge of the building still unaware
of Harrigan nowhere to go trapped Harrigan approaches

HARRIGAN

In a panic still hyperventilating the madman turns seeing
Harrigan but then something else something moving on the
levator housing behind Harrigan

He swings his weapons up In a heartbeat Harrigan FIRES
BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM the hot-load softnose 45 caliber

he hits the edge a flash of crazed eyes as the madman rolls
over the top and

slams face down through the canopy a fatal bellyflop
dead-center into the salsa and mound of avacados

EXT ROOFTOP DAY 22

Harrigan slams another CLIP into the 45 with a powerful
thrust He looks up at the sun

HARRIGAN
Damn it’s hot

He starts to move gingerly towards the edge when suddenly he
senses something behind him Instantly he spins releasing
the slide on the 45 going into a crouch eyes wide finger
closing on the trigger Harrigan stares through the
HEAT-WAVES shimmering off the roof He blinks squinting
seeing nothing but the elevator housing cables fence no
sign of any human

PREDATOR’S POV OF HARRIGAN 23
snapping INCLOSE to the huge 45 pointed directly at him

He senses that even though this hunter can’t see him his
instincts will cause him to fire the weapon if he moves an
inch

RETURN TO SCENE 24

Harrigan scanning the roof dismisses the feeling to nerves
He lowers the 45 starting for the stairway

Now moving towards him at an oblique angle The Predator
moves forward preparing to jump

As Danny and a DOZEN UNIFORMED POLICE heavily armed with
SHOTGUNS assault carbines wearing FLAK VESTS burst through
the stairwell and onto the roof

DANNY

Mike you okay
HARRIGAN
Yeah fine

Harrigan again moves carefully to the edge a hesitant look
to the street below Danny casually leaning out over the edge
wincing at the sight of the body below He absently fingers
the gold ST CHRISTOPHER’S MEDAL around his neck a habit he
does often He looks back at Harrigan Harrigan’s look to
Danny tells us he does suffer from acrophobia

HARRIGAN

I gotta get down from here

stunned at what she sees the room is literally bathed in

of machine-gun rounds

Three BODIES in various positions around the room are briefly
noted A uniformed COP is standing guard beside the door
trying hard to ignore the scene Leona weapon at her side
is staring at a BODY on the floor Harrigan moves alongside
her unprepared for what he finds one of the Colombians

recreating the firefight in his mind He reaches an alcove
a door slightly ajar Something wrong Weapon raised he
slowly opens the door with his free hand revealing a filthy
unkempt bathroom His eyes go to the floor a pool of BLOOD
collecting near the toilet

A single drop of BLOOD splatters into the pool a slight
WHISPER of SOUND from above Danny wheeling weapon
raised Against the grimy skylight twenty feet above a

Danny is slumped in his seat fanning himself with a section
of cardboard torn from a pizza box On the desk is a
disassembled ELECTRIC FAN SOLDERING IRON spare parts

Harrigan is standing at the window air conditioner unit which
emits only a pitiful SQUEAK as if on it’s last legs
Harrigan tests the air flow with his hand

He moves to the desk sitting He pulls the heavy 45 from
his holster THUMPING it down on the desk He looks at Danny

Latin drop dead beautiful pleads for Ramon to continue but
Ramon lunges across the bed reaching for an AUTOMATIC PISTOL

The ornate double doors explode off their hinges as three
JAMAICANS carrying silenced WEAPONS burst into the roon
revealing a quick view of the foyer a COLOMBIAN GUARD dead
on the floor blood splattered across the gold foil wallpaper

One of the Jamaicans is on Ramon smashing him across the
face knocking him to the floor A second Jamaican yanks
Ramon to his feet by his hair The third Jamaican huge
powerfully built terrifying look moves to the bed He grins
at Ramon revealing a GOLD TOOTH

Gold Tooth reaches out to the girl cowering in the bed

Now in shambles We MOVE towards one darkened end of the
room where we SEE eerie SHAPES dancing on a wall cast from
some flickering light source behind an alcove As we GROW
CLOSER we see the shadow-form of a MAN’S BODY hanging by
his feet

TIGHT ON the terrified sweating face of Ramon strange lights
flickering upward Around the bed in an eight foot diameter
COFFEE CANS containing burning CANDLES illuminate the scene

A DARK FORM places a dented galvanized BUCKET next to Ramon’s
head and a one gallon PICKLE JAR the lid quickly unscrewed

MOVING UP rapidly to Ramon’s chest huge HANDS use a BLOODIED

CHICKEN’S FOOT to paint a strange symbol on the bared skin

The terrifying image of Gold Tooth snaps into view long
dreadlocks yellow rheumy eyes The huge man tokes heavily
on a ten inch SPLIFF sparks and flames flying from the end
He passes the spliff to SOMEONE beside him exhaling a huge
cloud of smoke as he does He grins revealing again the
gleaming GOLD TOOTH

In the shadows we SEE SIX other JAMAICANS all heavily armed
with SHOTGUNS AUTOMATIC WEAPONS and PISTOLS

A long wicked-looking CANE KNIFE is whipped from its
scabbard the razor-sharp edge glistening in the candlelight
Ramon pleading for his life his macho countenance betrayed
by his trembling voice

RAMON
I can pay you two million in
cash Right now

The gold-toothed Jamaican grins holding up the knife

Gold Tooth LAUGHS chilling terrifying Suddenly his eyes
go cold as he drives the point of the knife into Ramon’s
jugular

a gout of BLOOD splattering across the girl’s chest and face
She SCREAMS horrified backing into the wall sliding to the
floor

A LASER BEAM silently FLASHES the DOTS centering on one of
the Jamaicans’ chest His eyes roll down curiously and then
towards the source as his chest cavity EXPLODES in a froth
of blood

A momentary pause before Gold Tooth SCREAMS pulling a BARETTA
92 from his waistband turning and OPENING FIRE in the
direction of the attack

On cue the others OPEN FIRE the room erupting with the
stroboscopic THUNDER of GUNFIRE continuing on for what seems
like an eternity the bullets blasting away chunks of
CONCRETE PLASTER WOOD and GLASS from the interior walls

The firing stops the room growing SILENT floating on a heavy
fog of gun smoke The interminable silence presses on as the
Jamaicans stare into the blackness deadly anxious faces
probing the room and then

one of the Jamaicans is ripped off his feet driven backwards
at incredible speed a NET of FINE WIRE driving itself into
the wall with SELF-DRIVEN BOLTS the man trapped behind the
taut wire burying itself into his face a lattice-work of
bloedlines appearing

Through the room a BLUR OF MOVEMENT now behind them a
Jamaican spinning around to fire two DARTS thudding into his
chest a THIRD sticking in his forehead

Another blur of movement through the middle of the Jamaicans
one man turning to SEE the gleaming BLADES of the Predator’s
FIGHTING KNIFE as they erupt from another man’s chest the man
pitchforked through the air

The stunned Jamaicans OPENS FIRE where the knives were a
second ago but from his left a TELESCOPING SPEAR rockets
into view from near the floor driving into his chest the
man also flipped through the air like a pole vaulter

The room grows silent as Gold Tooth circles in and out of the
light He looks down the breech of his Baretta open out of
bullets

From the shadow-edge the vague outline of the Predator
resolves now becoming VISIBLE

The Colombian watches wide-eyed in fear as the Predator moves
forward crossing in front of him as he closes in on Gold
Tooth frantically trying to load another CLIP into his
weapon

INT PENTHOUSE NIGHT 68

Danny is kneeling on the floor examining bloodstains finding
smeared FOOTPRINTS left by sport shoes He moves his light
passing over and then back to a strange SMEAR in another patch
of blood He moves closer studying the outline of a bizarre
PRINT a BARE FOOT bigger than both his hands and on one
end the distinctive impression of TOES Further on into the
wood he finds a partial track of the blood print and deep
GOUGES into the wood like claw marks

He stands playing his light up the wall following the marks
as they move upward left to right as if something ran up the
side He reaches the raftered ceiling a look of total
fascination and bewilderment as he plays the light across a
thick support beam tiny traces of torn wood visible on the
top

The light comes to rest at a spot twenty feet down the bean
the same GLITTERING object as seen before Danny grins
placing the light on the floor aiming the beam into the
rafters Finding a wall partially destroyed by gunfire he
tears away the sheetrock exposing some of the studs and
blocks

Using them as handholds he climbs to the top lifting himself
onto the wall and from there using the rafters for support
onto the beam

Cautiously he makes his way to the location of the object
Lowering himself carefully onto one knee he reaches down
and using his switchblade digs something from the wood

He holds it in his hand puzzled -- one of the Predator’s
DARTS

Holding onto the dart he stands As he turns his foot slips
on the splintered wood going out from under him Danny grabs
an overhead beam fighting to steady himself He breathes a
sigh of relief

Pivoting on the beam he reaches towards another rafter for
support but before his hand can touch the wood he GRASPS
something above it something invisible organic

Reacting in horror Danny rears back falling into space

In an instant the Predator’s arm materializes his hand
slamming onto Danny’s ankle claws digging deep into his
flesh Terrorized Danny reaches for his weapon swinging it
around but his fingers slip the weapon CLATTERING to the
floor In the final seconds of his life Danny sees something
in the darkness that turns his blood to ice

revealing the SKELETAL PICTURE of a human form dorsal and

Death was the result of a massive

What kind of weapon

EDWARDS
Double-edged twelve to fourteen
inches long razor sharp but with
some highly unusual properties

Edwards removes from a small lab REFRIGERATOR a mounted GLASS
SLIDE She moves across the room placing the sample into

the stage

of an ELECTRON SCANNING MICROSCOPE

On a VIDEO SCREEN the IMAGE switches through several fields

sample a
obscuring

of magnification ending on the CELLULAR STRUCTURE of a bone

light glaze of gray-black substance partially
one side of the cell-wall

EDWARDS
This is a bone sample taken from what
was left of the vertebral column
Were at 150000 times normal
magnification That gray-black haze
you see over the cell structure is
some kind of residue left by the path
of the weapon

Third Draft 011690 52 39
JERRY
Like the metallic traces left by a
bullet
EDWARDS

Yes But I believe this material

is not from the weapon itself but
some kind of lubricant adhering to
the blade creating a more efficient
medium of cutting like honing-oil
on a sharpening stone But the rest
defies analysis

Harrigan thinks a moment and then removes the Predator’s dart
from his pocket handing it to Edwards

HARRIGAN
I pried this from Danny’s hand This
is what took him into the rafters
He died for it

She takes the dart fascinated at it’s weight A curious look
from Jerry as he moves in for a closer look

EDWARDS
(astounded)
It has almost no weight

HARRIGAN
But cuts like steel

She slides the dart into the stage of the electron microscope
and throws a switch an IMAGE appearing on the monitor as a
COLOR BAND GRAPH corresponding to atomic weights

EDWARDS

Fascinating Properties that almost
defy description It’s not metal
but a crystalline compound similar
to diamond but much much harder
And it seems to possess the same
self-lubricating qualities as the
weapon that killed Detective Cutter

(points to the screen)
What you’re seeing is the vapor of
this material breaking down
Evaporating

She moves away from the microscope an incredulous look on
her face She looks at Harrigan

Pathologist for the city and they
avoided me completely

collected They must have run tests
maybe there’s some record something
left in the computer

He stands looking down at the Predator’s helmet He has to
see what is beneath it see this killer

He kneels balancing the shotgun across his knee studying the
massive helmet looking for a way to remove it He grabs two
HOSES twisting them a rush of GAS spewing forth He grasps
the helmet under the chin feeling a slight resistance
Gritting his teeth he pulls harder the SOUND of something
pulling away from a WET SURFACE

He clears the helmet from the Predator’s face repelled
backwards as the full impact of the alien’s mottled reptilian
skin and the horrible maw of pincers and teeth hits home

Yet he can’t take his eyes off the incredible visage

forming a second mouth move the mimic of a 6-year-old-boy --

from his emergency respirator

Looking for a way to cross over to the opposite building
Harrigan looks down seeing eight feet below him a series of
WATER and STEAM PIPES connecting the two buildings He steps
back his mind swimming with dizziness and nausea But he
steels himself breathing deeply

HARRIGAN
Maybe I‘’1l get lucky and fall

Holding the spear he hangs over the edge feet dangling the
pipes three feet below him He lets go his foot pushing
right through the CRUMBLING INSULATION of the pipes throwing
him backwards struggling twisting to regain his balance

Gingerly he gets to his feet walking across the pipes chunks
of insulation falling away as he crosses the ten feet to the
other side Clinging to the wall he turns facing the fire
escape still four feet away Taking a breath he leaps
grabbing the escape But the impact of his weight on the

throws the weapon overhand like a discus the disk streaking
towards Harrigan

who instinctively ducks blocking with the spear which the

As the Predator turns to move Harrigan is to his feet
charging swinging the spear from his hip taking the Predator
on his right shoulder and arm the smart weapon knocked from

Instantly the Predator spins the fighting knives slashing
through the spear cutting it in half

Undaunted Harrigan swings the remaining section of spear
hitting the Predator in the side of the face recovering
smashing him again

With a SCREAM the Predator connects with a backhand to
Harrigan’s chest knocking him off his feet and to the roof

The Predator gasping for breath turns to leap

Like an enraged bull Harrigan charges tackling the Predator
around the waist driving the Predator forward the KILLING
KNIVES slashing for Harrigan’s body just as he hits the edge

As the Predator off balance begins to topple over he grabs
Harrigan’s arm dragging him over the roof The Predator
drives the smart weapon into the brick where it wedges
leaving Harrigan on the ledge of the building to his waist
the Predator dangling in mid-air his glowing blood flowing
heavily from his shoulder wound his hand grasping Harrigan’s
forearm and the smart weapon As the Predator’s hand begins
to slip he buries his claws into Harrigan’s flesh drawing

short of grasping the weapon

Below him the Predator continues painfully to punch in the

With a SHOUT Harrigan lunges touching the weapon with his

and inactive in his hand He squeezes the weapon but it
fails to activate

With terrified eyes Harrigan looks down SEEING that the

red indicators in each section click off

In one final CRY OF ANGUISH and RAGE Harrigan squeezes with
every last ounce of his strength the weapon POWERING TO

He puts the breather to his face inhaling deeply - a new
source of power surging through the Predator

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 232

Ruth has reached the bathroom and is extending her arm towards
the knob as suddenly the entire door and casement are torn
from the wall on the hinge side the door pivoting on the
latch towards Ruth who disappears behind the door The
Predator passes frame exiting

As the door falls revealing a terrified Ruth she sees the
front door explode as something huge and dark tears right
through it

In his chair Herb awakens with a start

HERB
Ruth there’s someone at the door

INT APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 233

Harrigan flying down the stairs carrying the smart weapon in
his hand He reaches the floor to Ruth and Herb’s apartment
where several RESIDENTS peer from their doors ducking back
in as they see Harrigan wet bloody clothes in shards a
strange Frisbee-like weapon in his hand

Harrigan passes Ruth and Herb’s apartment a jagged HOLE where
the door used to be He stops looking inside making eye
contact with a still shaken Ruth

HARRIGAN
It’s all right I’m a cop

Ruth looks at his tattered appearance and then to her
demolished door

RUTH
I don’t think he gives a shit

A MUFFLED EXPLOSION welling up through the elevator shaft
at the end of the hall causes Harrigan to spin his hand
grasping the smart weapon

Harrigan moves down the hall to the elevator finding one door
buckled and bent outward He looks in SEEING the car above
below him the exposed shaft leading to the pit He SEES a
faint GLOW of the Predator’s blood on the counter-weight
cables attached to the wall Further down the shaft he SEES
another smear of blood

233

Harrigan looks up at the loop of cables just out of reach
hanging from the bottom of the car above him He hesitates

a moment and then placing the smart weapon in his waist band
he reaches outside pushing the down button on the elevator
the elevator charging to life

INT ELEVATOR SHAFTPIT - NIGHT 233A

As the car descends Harrigan leaps into the shaft grabbing
the loop the descending car carrying him down towards the
blackened pit

Harrigan hits the floor of the pit the elevator still
descending He desperately searches for the exit route the
Predator must have taken the car above continuing to thunder
down towards him

At the last second he SEES the faint impression of a hole in
the side of the well two feet above the floor Harrigan
dives

INT TELEPHONE CABLE ACCESS TUNNEL - NIGHT 2338

Harrigan tumbles into the narrow tunnel just as the elevator
car crushes to a halt on the other side obscuring the hole

Harrigan fumbles for a book of MATCHES striking one In the
glow of the light he sees a hole blasted through the
concrete twisted rebar and rubble scattered across the floor

He turns finding he is in a long narrow tunnel the walls
and ceiling packed with telephone CABLE and RELAY BOXES A
low-level GLOW-LIGHT TUBE runs the length of the shaft a work
light illuminating the scene Traces of the Predator’s blood
are still glowing on the floor Harrigan crawls along the
tunnel a few yards later finding another hole blasted
through the floor

Harrigan strikes another match but a flow of air from the
hole quickly extinguishes the match Putting his ear to the
hole Harrigan can HEAR the faint SOUND of dripping water

Grabbing the edges he lowers himself gingerly into the hole
terrified at what might be waiting below

INT THE BLACK VOID - NIGHT 234
Harrigan’s feet descend into the darkness feeling for support
-- nothing He lowers himself fully hanging on by his
fingertips finding himself in near total darkness his feet
still touching nothing but air

Third Draft 011690 104

234

Sweating Harrigan frantically feels for something below his
hands beginning to slip on the jagged edges of the concrete
Unable to pull himself back and finding nothing below
fingers slipping

HARRIGAN
Oh shit

He lets go falling

Six feet landing hard on a steel decking of some kind He
gets to his feet trying to orientate to the darkness By
the SOUND of echoing dripping water he realizes he is in
some huge cavernous chamber

He removes the smart weapon from his waist Using his free
hand he strikes a match from the book onehanded barroom
style He holds the match up the faint glow only penetrating
the gloom a few feet

HARRIGAN
Must be the sewer

He moves forward along the metal floor covered in water

As he proceeds he realizes he is starting to descend at a
gradual slope the impression of walls and a ceiling beginning
to form He continues downward a faint glow of LIGHT now
visible some fifty yards ahead revealing that the passageway
is beginning to curve outwards in a gentle arc

As he grows closer to the light he sees that his feet are
obscured in a fog of brown GAS swirling higher as he
descends His breathing is starting to become labored and
difficult

HARRIGAN
(ominously)
Methane

With the light now closer he sees that he is not inside some
sewer tunnel but something organic-looking the membranelike
Sections of the walls resembling the inside of a chambered
nautilus

HARRIGAN
What the hell is this

The gas now waist high he reaches the end of the passageway
opening into a LARGE ROOM the convergence of many other
tunnels some descending some rising His eyes scan the
room

Third Draft 011690 105 234

HARRIGAN
(to himself)
Anybody home

Suddenly from the mist a hurtling MASS rushes towards hin
Harrigan yanked off his feet by the impact of the Predator’s
NET driving him backwards to the wall the SPIKES on the net
burrowing into the ship’s wall the net tightening

As the net begins to cut into his face and body Harrigan
squeezes the smart weapon which ENERGIZES slicing through the
net Harrigan dropping to the floor

On his hands and knees Harrigan looks up to SEE the Predator
holding a futuristic MACE pommeled handle bristling with
denticle hooks slightly flexible for ripping and tearing
With a lightening movement the mace drives towards
Harrigan

which is deflected by a nearly instinctual movement by the
smart weapon a FLASH of steel as the mace is intersected
the blow knocking Harrigan across the room the Predator

rushing in for another attack

Using the smart weapon as a shield Harrigan encounters blow
after blow from the Predator’s mace each hit blasting him
off his feet slamming him into the walls and floor of the
alien spacecraft Harrigan barely recovering before he is hit
again

His breathing now ragged and gasping Harrigan is near the
end of his endurance He can’t survive much longer

Another powerful sweeping blow from the mace hurls him
backwards into the wall the smart weapon flying from his
bruised and trembling hand landing several feet away

As Harrigan starts to move towards the weapon the mace
flashes the head blocking the way Gasping for breath
terrified Harrigan backs away The Predator advances and
stops dropping the mace Harrigan then hears the chilling
mimic of his own VOICE

HARRIGAN’S VOICE (V0)
(filtered)
Watch your ass Danny Boy

The killing knives slash into position the Predator advancing
towards Harrigan who can do nothing but wait for the final
blow Harrigan’s terrified eyes go to the smart weapon lying
on the floor then back to the Predator his huge form now
looming over him

Third Draft 011690 106 234

As the Predator lunges with a killing upper cut Harrigan
dives to one side the knives in a shower of sparks raking
across the wall Harrigan grabs the Smart Weapon energizing
it and with a driving lunge with the last of his strength
lunges upward the smart weapon slicing deeply into the
Predator’s exposed midsection burying itself deeply inside

With a deafening SCREAM and a flood of green BLOOD the
Predator staggers backwards As the Predator turns and drops
to his knees Harrigan struggles to his feet grabbing the
mace

Harrigan raises the mace barely able to lift it’s weight
stumbling forward attacking the dying alien

Like a hard-shelled cockroach that refuses to die Harrigan
pounds and pummels the creature with the last of his strength
as the Predator continues to crawl towards a now activated
LIFE-CHAMBER that somehow will save the Predator

Harrigan delivers blow after blow to the Predator alternately
kicking and shoving him but the Predator near death will
not quit

HARRIGAN

(gasping)
Die you bastard die

The Predator reaches the chamber a door sliding open a waft
of gas emerging another second and the Predator will be
inside -But as the Predator rolls to one side Harrigan
thrusts his hand deep into the green gore of his chest
activating and withdrawing the smart weapon With the last
of his breath he raises the weapon over his head

HARRIGAN
That’s right fucker shit happens

Unbelievably he HEARS the chilling SOUND of a heavy clucking
TRILL coming from behind him In disbelief he turns
paralyzed in shock as he SEES materializing from the mist
the impossible sight of ANOTHER PREDATOR turning from
camouflage to visible followed by ANOTHER and ANOTHER and
yet ANOTHER emerging from the various passageways until
there are TEN PREDATORS standing abreast

Harrigan stumbles backwards in complete astonishment dropping
the weapon He collapses to his knees

As two of the Predators walk forward picking up their
vanquished comrade the first Predator larger and more
ancient-looking than the others his body festooned with
TROPHIES taken from many kills steps forward

Third Draft 011690 107 234

Dumbstruck with fatigue and shock Harrigan watches transfixed
as the grayback approaches the gleaming fighting knives
moving The grayback raises his arm holding Suddenly the
knives are withdrawn

Reaching behind him the Grayback grabs something removing
an OBJECT which he throws to Harrigan Harrigan catches it
slowly looking down seeing the engraved silver and wood
forestock of a seventeenth century MATCHLOCK PISTOL He turns
it over in his hands SEEING a NAME and a DATE engraved into
the silver the name in ITALIAN the date 1640

Harrigan looks up staring at the Grayback Suddenly the hard
floor below him changes becoming nearly liquid Harrigan
dropping into the darkness in a controlled fall blurred
impressions of the SHIP’S bio-mechanical structure rushing

by as a powerful low-pitched WHINE builds to an ear-splitting
crescendo

OMITTED thru

INT ABANDONED SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT 238

Harrigan is dropped to the wet ground He looks up above
him as a massive SHAPE begins to move at incredible speed
In a BLAST of energy the SHIP races past overhead
disappearing in a huge EXPLOSION of light and SOUND the
concussion knocking Harrigan to the ground

Slowly he gets to his feet as a hurrican wind of dust and
sand fills the room now illuminated by dim sunlight
streaming in from a hole at the far end Holding the pistol
Harrigan moves painfully towards the light

BEGIN END CREDITS

EXT ABANDONED SUBWAY EXIT - DAWN 239

The site of a projectile of tremendous weight and power
leaving at incredible speed giant still smoulder trenches
cut through the earth

From the tunnel opening Harrigan appears picking his way
forward looking like a man returned from hell his clothes
nearly torn from his body his skin dusted with a fine layer
of ash dust and sand Harrigan barely walking but still
on his feet moves into the opening

Harrigan turns started by the THUMPING WHINE of a HELICOPTER
flaring into view holding over the scene

Third Draft 011690 108

239

In the swirling wash of the rotor Harrigan shields his eyes
looking upward SEEING Garber framed in the doorway of the
black Jet Ranger Garber seems overwhelmed defeated Garber
looks up into the sky at the diminishing VAPOR TRAIL He
looks back at Harrigan

HARRIGAN
(to himself)
Don’t worry they’1ll be back

As a flood of EMERGENCY VEHICLES lights flashing descend
on the scene Harrigan looks into the dawn sky to the track
of a MOVING POINT OF LIGHT outbound
