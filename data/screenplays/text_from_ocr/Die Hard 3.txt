brownstone and walks down the front stoop She turns
south on the sidewalk heading for McClane

hand He looks around the intersection Across the
street the GANG MEMBERS are hanging out playing cards
oblivious to anything unusual

Zeus looks south-easterly at the other corner

It is a bizarre surreal sight

In blazing sunshine on the worst street in Harlem a
white man is standing in boxer shorts socks and shoes
wearing a large white sandwich board It is McClane

The front of the board in huge red letters reads
BG HATE NIGGERS

Zeus blinks He frowns He thinks
He walks diagonally across the intersection

MCCLANE sees Zeus coming

zeus approaches him He stops in the street ten feet
from McClane eyeing him quizzically

ZEUS
Good morning

They stare at each other
Zeus’ eyes dart from McClane to the GANG MEMBERS on the

corner

ZEUS
Havin’ a good day sir You feelin’
okay
(comes closer)

’ Not to get too personal but a white
man standing in the middie of Harlem
wearing a sign saying I hate

personal issues or he’s a few boats
shy of a fleet

Out of the corner of his eye Zeus sees --

THE CARDGAME - ONE OF THE PLAYERS (GANG MEMBER 1)
having lost a big hand flings his cards over his
opponent’s head The cards twirl like little -frisbees
TOWARD THE INTERSECTION CORNER

The opponent (GANG MEMBER 2) chases the cards He grabs
a couple He is nearly in the intersection Suddenly
he freezes --

He stands up looking straight at McClane

The other GANG MEMBERS following the flight of the
cards also see hin

GANG MEMBER 2

ZEUS
Ahh shittt

THE GANG MEMBERS are now standing on the opposite corner
of the street staring at McClane and Zeus

MCCLANE turns to Zeus his speech clipped urgent

MCCLANE

MCCLANE
Whoever did that said I had to do
this or he’d blow up something else

ZEUS

THE GANG MEMBERS start across the street

MCCLANE

ZEUS
Where Never mind You pull a gun

obviously not crazy but I want you
to act it Like Looney Toons okay

McClane nods acknowledging this

The GANG MEMBERS are upon then

They circle around McClane staring at the sandwich
board They are amused Sort of They smile

After an ice-cold pause
GANG MEMBER 1

Hey Zeus This a friend o’ yours

McClane staggers forward his torso now exposed Taped
to the small of his back is the 22 clip handgun

Zeus sees the gun before anyone else
He lunges behind McClane and RIPS the gun from McClane’s
back tape and all

Zeus brings the gun down training it on the Gang
Members wildly back and forth from member to member

Startled they recoil

Except for Gang Member 1 who sticks the switchblade
under McClane’s chin

ZEUS
- Put it down

A tense pause
Zeus cocks the gun His hand is rock steady

ZEUS
I’ll kill you I won’t want to but
I’1l do it

Gang Member 1 tosses the knife down He backs off
McClane joins Zeus At this moment --

A HARLEM LIVERY CAB comes up to the intersection and
stops at the light It’s right next to then

Zeus points a gun at THE LIVERY CAB DRIVER who looks
back with wide terrified eyes

ZEUS
Stay where you are

Zeus motions to McClane

MCCLANE
Who are you

COBB
Fred Schilling John Fred does a
lot of our psychiatric criminal
evaluations at Bellevue hospital I
asked him to be here What’s your
opinion Doctor

A pause Schilling puffs his pipe

DR SCHILLING
Any understanding of this character
starts necessarily with an
understanding of megalomania - it’s
a sickness - a pathological
condition in which fantasies of
control or omnipotence
predominate

- MCCLANE
speak English

DR SCHILLING
He wants control over you - every
move you make your thoughts your
emotions Megalomaniacs don’t
operate anonymously - they need to
know that you’ know who they are
(beat he puffs on his
pipe)
I can virtually guarantee this man’s
name is Simon - or possibly some
variation of that
