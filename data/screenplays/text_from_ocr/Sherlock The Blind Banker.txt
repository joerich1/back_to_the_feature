The pot is seasoned by repeatedly
pouring tea over the surface

Embarrassed she looks away

These pots need attention The clay

ANDY
I can’t see how a tiny splash of
tea is gonna help

Soo LIN
Sometimes you have to look hard at
something - to see its value

She holds up the pot It shines in the light

Soo LIN

brighter

Why won’t she look a him She only has eyes for the
artefacts caresses them gently

She isn’t alone in there She calls into the empty space
SOO LIN

(No answer)
I’m still in here
(Nothing)
Just another couple of minutes

A small gust of air makes the dust covers billow As if
someone has opened a door somewhere

Soo LIN
Hello

In the corner a statue covered loosely with a dust cloth
The cloth billows about - someone has untied it

Two pale arms poke out from beneath the cloth Why has the
statue been untied

SOO LIN reaches out and pulls the cloth away

POV the statue SOO LIN freezes in horror Something about
the figure terrifies her

She opens her mouth and screams but the scream becomes

His flat is sparse - parchment-coloured walls a pristine

And then he hears something terrifying

In the distance - a drum A single rhythmic monotone Tribal
Menacing

Dashes into the bedroom

No bed Just a mattress A large pile of books stacked in the
corner

And a suitcase

The window is open Pale muslin curtains billow The drum

SEB
Youre doing that thing
(To John)

We were at Uni together and this
guy here - he had this trick he
used to do

SHERLOCK
It’s not a trick

SEB
He could look at you and tell
your whole life story

JOHN

Yes I’ve seen him do it
SEB

Put the wind up everyone We

hated him
JOHN quietly delighted with this

SEB
(Amused)
Youd come to breakfast in the
formal hall and this freak - he
would know who you’d been
shagging the previous night

I simply observed

Gonna tell ‘em there’s a stain on
my tie - from a type of ketchup you

who sat here has passed away - but the place has been left
like a museum

A gilt-framed oil painting a portrait of a grim-faced
banker

The plaque reads ‘SIR WILLIAM SHAD 1944-2009 CHAIRMAN’
But the picture has been vandalised

Someone has drawn a thick line across Sir Williams eyes
using bright yellow aerosol The paint has dripped leaving

a row of yellow tentacles

On the wall below the artist has left his tag An illegible
scrawl

The only ornament - a small stone Buddha

A knock at the door It’s JOHN waiting outside

Pokes his head inside a tiny pristine bathroom - a single
toothbrush and a dispenser of liquid soap

JOHN

EDDIE VAN COON lies on his bed exactly where he was at lam

He’s been shot through the head

You think maybe he’d lost a lot of
money Suicide rate is pretty high
amongst these city types

THE BLIND BANKER SHOOTING (DRAFT 8) GREEN 16-02-10

SHERLOCK
We don’t know that it was suicide

JOHN
Come on His door was locked from
the inside You had to climb across
the balcony

SHERLOCK observes the dead man’s suitcase

It is stuffed full of underwear and socks but there is a hole
in the middle - a large impression left in all the clothes

Something else was packed in there A long cylindrical shape

SHERLOCK
Been away Three days judging by
the laundry Look - something was
packed tightly inside this case

JOHN
Thanks - I’1l take your word for
it

SHERLOCK

What’s the matter

JOHN
I’m not desperate to root around
some bloke’s dirty underwear

SHERLOCK studies the corpse
SHERLOCK
Those symbols at the bank - that
graffiti Why was it put there

JOHN
You think it was some sort of code

SHERLOCK
Obviously But I’m saying why paint
it Why not use email if you want
to make contact Or the phone
It takes JOHN a moment Then

JOHN
Maybe he wasn’t answering

SHERLOCK
Good You follow

JOHN

THE BLIND BANKER SHOOTING (DRAFT 8) GREEN 16-02-10

SHERLOCK
What sort of message would everyone
try to avoid
There is something in the dead man’s mouth

SHERLOCK puts on his gloves and delicately pokes inside

SHERLOCK
What about this morning Those
letters you were looking at

JOHN
Bills

SHERLOCK
Yes He was being threatened

JOHN
Not by the gas board

From the dead man’s mouth SHERLOCK retrieves

A small screwed up ball of black paper - moist with saliva
He stretches it open - it’s simply blank

Just that moment a police Inspector enters - DI DIMMOCK A
newly promoted graduate Small fresh-faced

SHERLOCK
Ah Sergeant We haven’t met

DIMMOCK
(Without joy)
I know who you are And Id prefer
it if you didn’t tamper with any of
the evidence

SHERLOCK puts the soggy ball of black paper into an evidence
bag and hands it over

SHERLOCK
I phoned Lestrade Is he on his
way

He’s busy I’m in charge And it’s
not Sergeant It’s Detective

DIMMOCK
We’re obviously looking at a
suicide

JOHN

It does seem the only explanation
of the facts

SHERLOCK
Wrong It’s one possible
explanation of some of the facts
Youve got a solution that you
like but you’re just choosing
to ignore anything you see that
doesn’t comply with it

DIMMOCK
Like
SHERLOCK
The wound is on the right side of
his head
DIMMOCK
And
SHERLOCK

Van Coon was left-handed

Mimes shooting himself in the right temple with his left
hand

SHERLOCK
Requires a bit of contortion

DIMMOCK
Left-handed

SHERLOCK
I’m amazed you didn’t notice All
you have to do is look around
this flat

And Whoosh

SHERLOCK

(V0)
tea stains from the bottom of
mugs where he’s been resting them
on the arm of that chair The left
arm Pad and paper on the left
side of his phone means he could
hold it in his right hand and take
messages with his left All his
expensive favourite suits on the
left side of his wardrobe because
he’d open the left-hand door

THE BLIND BANKER SHOOTING (DRAFT 8) GREEN 16-02-10

Back to the flat

SHERLOCK
Want me to go on

JOHN sensing DIMMOCK’S irritation

JOHN
Er no I think you’ve covered it

SHERLOCK
I might as well actually There’s
only one left on the list

And Whoosh

SHERLOCK (VO)
The butter knife on the kitchen
surface has butter on the right
side of the blade because he used
it with his left Unlikely that a
left-handed man would shoot
himself in the right side of the
head Conclusion someone broke
in and murdered him Only
explanation of all of the facts

DIMMOCK
But the gun

SHERLOCK
He was waiting for the killer He’d
been threatened

DIMMOCK
What

JOHN
Today at the bank A sort of a
warning

SHERLOCK

He fired when his attacker came in

DIMMOCK
And the bullet

SHERLOCK
Went out the window

DIMMOCK observes - the other officers are gossiping about
SHERLOCK smirking

DIMMOCK

Oh come on What are the chances
of that

THE BLIND BANKER SHOOTING (DRAFT 8) GREEN

SHERLOCK
Wait for the pathologist’s report
The bullet in his brain wasn’t
fired from his gun I guarantee

DIMMOCK

That’s been on the step since
Monday

SHERLOCK rings No response

SHERLOCK
Noone’s been in this flat for at
least three days

SHERLOCK darts down the side of the building - a side alley -
JOHN scuttling after

JOHN
They’re away on holiday So what

SHERLOCK
Do you leave your windows open when
you go away

Looks up The window of the flat is gaping wide There is
scaffolding at the back of the flats

SHERLOCK jumps up on a dustbin hauling himself up on the
scaffolding

Reaches the windows of the first floor flat One of them is
wide open He jumps inside

INTEXT SHAFTESBURY AVENUE - SOO LINS FLAT DAY 66

SHERLOCK lands inside

On the window ledge is a vase He almost knocks it over -
just manages to catch it

A fastidiously clean little studio flat Good taste but no
money to indulge it

Everywhere there are feminine touches - dried flowers
embroidered cushions A Chinese screen

But the place is cold - noone has been here for days

Washing up drained dry on the draining board One cup one
plate one bowl one pair of chopsticks The washing machine
light says ‘End’ SHERLOCK opens it The washing is damp and
it smells

In the corner is a clothes horse hung with laundry - all of

it bone dry The flowers in the vase are sagging He opens
the fridge and sniffs the milk - gone sour

THE BLIND BANKER SHOOTING (DRAFT 8) GREEN 16-02-10

The doorbell rings again JOHN is outside the front again He
shouts through the letterbox

JOHN (0S)
You think maybe you could let me in
this time

SHERLOCK ignores JOHN Goes to the mantelpiece

An old photo of a Chinese baby girl and baby boy hugging each
other There are fingerprints on the glossy surface

JOHN (0S)
Oh for heaven’s sake Can you not
keep doing this please

SHERLOCK turns back to the window
A small puddle of water on the floor beside it
SHERLOCK
(Shouting downstairs)

I’m not the first

JOHN
What

SHERLOCK
Someone else has been here Someone
broke into this flat

Touches the puddle of water
SHERLOCK
He knocked that vase just like I
did

He starts to hunt around eagerly on the carpet - looking for
depressions in the pile Finds the hazy impressions of shoes

SHERLOCK
Size eleven He was tall But not
heavy

He follows the footprints to the mantelpiece Looks back at
the photo - the fingerprints on it The intruder held it

SHERLOCK
Long thin fingers Our acrobat

JOHN (0S)

Looks back at the window

SHERLOCK
Why didn’t he close it when he
left

Stupid Stupid It’s obvious
Because he’s still in here

Looks at the Chinese screen The only place the intruder can
be

SHERLOCK tugs it quickly to one side Noone there Just a
pile of cuddly toys

But

Look behind you Sherlock A shadow moving out from behind
the clothes horse - the mountain of laundry

Someone slips a piece of the laundry around his neck and
pulls hard - drags him to the carpet strangling him

It’s ZHI ZHU - the spider

flailing all the time

Tighter and tighter the cord is pulled

And then just as SHERLOCK is about to black out the
assailant mysteriously lets go

His assailant pushes something into SHERLOCK’S top pocket and
scurries away through the open window

SHERLOCK is too weak to pursue

He glances up to see a shadowy figure leaping through the
frame

Why didn’t he kill him He coughs - regains his breath

it

A tiny drip of the yellow paint on the railway line - a thin
line like a trail of bread crumbs

JOHN makes his way along the tracks The line snakes away
into the dark

He turns a corner and his eyes light up Bingo
Illuminated only by the dull bulb of a street-lamp the

wall here is thick with ciphers eighteen of the yellow
symbols grouped in nine pairs

He studies them closely - runs his hand over them all - like
mystic ancient runes Chinese numbers

He gets out his phone to phone SHERLOCK No reception in the

to the dates that VAN COON or LUKIS went to China

They tally precisely - same pattern on the page

JOHN
Every single auction coincides with
Eddie or Brian Lukis travelling to
China

SHERLOCK
So if one of those men was greedy
when they were in China - if they
stole something

JOHN
That’s why he’s come

A knock It’s MRS HUDSON
MRS HUDSON
Are we collecting for charity

Sherlock

SHERLOCK
What

MRS HUDSON
A young man’s outside with a crate
of books
INT 221B BAKER STREET NIGHT 90

The Baker Street flat filled with boxes and boxes of books
Everywhere they are piled high

A couple of CONSTABLES are bringing in more

Some boxes are labelled VAN COON some are labelled LUKIS
SHERLOCK and JOHN sit amidst a huge stack of them

SHERLOCK

So The numbers - they’re
references

JOHN
To books

SHERLOCK
To specific pages And specific
words on those pages

JOHN

Right So ‘15’ and ‘1’ That
means

70B
THE BLIND BANKER SHOOTING (DRAFT 8) GREEN 16-02-10

SHERLOCK
You turn to page fifteen and it’s
the first word that you read

JOHN
OK So What’s the message

SHERLOCK
Depends on the book It would never
be the same book twice That’s the
cunning of a book code

Stares at the burgeoning piles

SHERLOCK
It’s got to be something they both
own

JOHN

(Dry)
OK fine Well this shouldn’t take
too long should it

JOHN starts to make a painstaking list of all the books and
then attempts to cross-reference them

DIMMOCK enters next - he’s carrying a stack of papers sealed
in an evidence bag

The bag has a white label stuck over the seal - ‘POLICE
EVIDENCE’

DIMMOCK
We found these At the museum Is
this your writing

Puts them under SHERLOCK’S nose It’s the pages of scribbled
ciphers that he asked her to translate

JOHN
We hoped maybe she could decipher
it

Neither SHERLOCK nor JOHN examine it

SHERLOCK grabs the bundle of evidence and slings it on his
desk - amidst the jumble

DIMMOCK hovers for a moment - trying to see what they are
doing He wants to be part of the gang now

DIMMOCK
Anything else I can do
(Pause No response)
To assist you I mean

THE BLIND BANKER SHOOTING (DRAFT 8) GREEN 16-02-10

SHERLOCK
(Without looking up)
Some silence would be marvellous
DIMMOCK slopes out Not one of the gang

CUT TO

JOHN locating identical pairs of books and handing them to
SHERLOCK two copies of every best seller

SHERLOCK takes the first pair - two copies of a trashy
thriller - something that everyone owns

He opens one and examines it

No use

JUMP CUT through a series of attempts to match the numbers to
words in different books Always the fifteenth page and the

first word written there

Nothing significant The word is always something innocuous
like ‘and’ or ‘the’

Or occasionally something saucy like ‘bum’

SHERLOCK
The thing about a book code - it
has to be a book that all of the
gang members own And one that they
all have access to

JOHN
No it wasn’t

At least I hope not

SHERLOCK finds his wallet

SHERLOCK
Where you taking her

JOHN
Cinema

SHERLOCK

Hardly original What about this
He digs into his wallet - takes out a scrap of paper

It is the tiny shred of a poster that he peeled off the wall
from the railway arches

SHERLOCK
In London for one night only

JOHN
Thanks but I don’t come to you for
dating advice

JOHN looks at the paper - no picture Just a scrap that says
‘CIRCUS’ and has the box office phone number

A friend recommended it to me He
phoned up

SARAH
Is it a touring company or
something

JOHN
I don’t know much about it

They turn the corner SARAH sees the venue

SARAH
I think it’s probably from China

POV SARAH and JOHN They have come to a theatre

The front facade is decorated in a hundred Chinese
lanterns There is a poster ‘The Yellow Dragon Circus’

The same poster that SHERLOCK saw - the bottom corner of it
matches his tiny scrap

JOHN looks entirely suspicious

INT THEATRE - AUDITORIUM NIGHT 97

No seats in the derelict music hall The audience stands in
the empty space A ring of candles

In the centre is a tall tripod covered with a black cloth

A female performer enters dressed in the make up and robes
of the Chinese opera (rouged face and gold head-dress)

A drummer bangs out a monotonous beat on the Dagu drum A
sound that is eerily familiar

Same drum they heard at the museum Same drum VAN COON and
LUKIS both heard

The OPERA SINGER pulls off the cloth Balanced on the
tripod is an evil-looking ballista - an ancient Chinese
crossbow

At one end is the long metal shaft ready to fire At the
other end hangs a metal bowl on a chain dangling from the
trigger

A big crash from the drummer

From her robes the OPERA SINGER produces a lethal-looking
crossbow bolt She puts it in the ballista mechanism and
cocks the spring

A wooden plank (cut into the shape of a man) is strapped to
the apron of the stage The ballista points straight at its

imaginary heart

The OPERA SINGER raises her hands for silence Hush Then
drum roll

She extracts a white feather from her head-dress Gently
she drops the feather into the metal bowl

The mechanism is so sensitive that the weight of the
feather pulls the trigger down and releases the spring

The deadly dart fires straight into the plank Gasps
Music

The OPERA SINGER retrieves the dart from the plank and
replaces it in the ballista

A masked warrior (WARLORD) enters dressed all in black -
short and muscular

JOHN
I think I know what’s coming

He stands against the plank The OPERA SINGER ties him with
thick cords so he is unable to move

THE BLIND BANKER SHOOTING (DRAFT 8) GREEN 16-02-10

SARAH
Dear God What are they going to
do now

SHERLOCK

Ancient Chinese escapology act
The crossbow is on a delicate
spring The warrior has to escape
his bonds before it fires

JOHN
Well that sounds like ideal
entertainment for a Friday night

Crash SARAH jumps again and clutches JOHN for comfort
The ballista spring is pulled back Then

A long golden rope is lowered from the ceiling Attached to
the bottom end is a sandbag

The rope runs up and over a beam Attached to the end in
the roof is a metal weight shaped like a teardrop

SHERLOCK
They split the sandbag so the
sand pours out The weight is
gradually lowered on to the bowl
Classic Chinese circus act

JOHN
I would have been happy with a
bit of juggling and a couple of
clowns

Crash on the drums SARAH hugs tighter to JOHN
JOHN
(Under his breath)
Then again

The masked warrior is in place strapped to the plank

The OPERA SINGER takes out a knife cuts a gash in the
sandbag The sand starts to pour out

Slowly slowly it rises to the ceiling spinning all the
while On the other end of the rope the metal weight is
gradually lowered towards the waiting bowl

The drummer begins his crescendo

The warrior in black struggles in his bonds The cords that

bind him do not seem to budge SARAH is terrified and JOHN
is visibly tense

THE BLIND BANKER SHOOTING (DRAFT 8) GREEN 16-02-10

The sandbag is almost bereft of sand - higher and higher it
rises

The metal weight drops down almost touching the bowl
Then after struggling for an eternity the warrior seems
to be loosening some of his bonds But maybe it’s too
late

The sand runs out the weight lands in the bowl the
warrior pulls away and ducks

The ballista is triggered the dart fires into the plank
he steps aside and it misses him by a whisker

The crowd breaks into spontaneous applause

JOHN
How about that

JOHN turns to SHERLOCK But SHERLOCK is not there

INT THEATRE - BACKSTAGE NIGHT 98
SHERLOCK tiptoes around backstage

He finds a dressing room area - empty

The light is dim - just a few candles Chinese costumes
litter the tables and chairs Sticks of greasepaint and

abandoned opera masks

In the corner is a mannequin dressed in green A head-dress
rests on the top - the face of a Chinese WARLORD

SHERLOCK takes the head-dress off and examines it -
intricate workmanship glittering designs

Applause in the distance Replaces the head-dress on the
Mannequin and leaves

INT THEATRE - AUDITORIUM NIGHT 99
A new circus act beginning

OPERA SINGER
Ladies and gentlemen from the
distant moonlit shores of the
Yangtze river we present for
your pleasure the deadly
Chinese bird spider

Recorded music plays - ambient From the ceiling drops a
large length of grey silk

Dressed from head to foot in grey - grey leotard and grey
mask - a tall angular man enters He climbs the rope

THE BLIND BANKER SHOOTING (DRAFT 8) GREEN 16-02-10
His movements are swift and effortless He climbs thirty
feet in the air and winds himself into the silken banner
Then using fluid and balletic movements he gently abseils
down the silken train and hovers just above the heads of
the audience

Focus on SARAH’S face She is entranced
Focus on JOHN’S face troubled
SARAH
(Awed whisper)
Were you expecting anything like
this
JOHN
Actually yes
INT THEATRE - BACKSTAGE NIGHT 100

SHERLOCK peers through a crack in the curtain and witnesses
the human spider act

SHERLOCK
Well well

Footsteps Someone is coming - the OPERA SINGER leaving
the stage

SHERLOCK darts back along the narrow wing space and into
the deserted dressing room area

He bobs down low behind a hamper waiting for the footsteps
to die And then he sees it

A small black kit bag lying on the floor There are tiny
dabs of yellow paint on the handle

He unzips it and reaches inside And he retrieves an
aerosol can

The footsteps have gone SHERLOCK jumps to his feet and
sprays the can at the mirror

It’s yellow paint

SHERLOCK
Found you

He makes for the door glancing at the mannequin - the
green robes and the WARLORD head-dress

Is something different Has the mannequin changed from when
he clapped eyes on it three minutes ago

He scans the figure from head to toe Did it have hands

THE BLIND BANKER SHOOTING (DRAFT 8) GREEN 16-02-10

And were those hands carrying a sword

He gazes at the face nose to nose And then the face opens
its mouth and screams A full-throated war-cry

Someone is wearing the WARLORD costume now
And he attacks SHERLOCK brandishing the sword
CUT TO

JOHN and SARAH stare in wonder at ZHI ZHU as he
effortlessly scales the huge skein of silk

The accompanying music plays at full volume masking any
sound from

CUT TO

SHERLOCK and the CHINESE WARLORD are locked in hand to hand
combat The man is squat and bulky but immensely strong

The WARLORD lands one blow after another SHERLOCK narrowly
managing to dodge them and to keep his footing

He tries the ‘Watch Out’ routine (since it worked so well on
the SIKH) He points into the corner

SHERLOCK
Hey

This time the trick fails miserably - the CHINESE WARLORD
just punches him in the gob

He grabs the paint can and uses it as a weapon - spraying
it into the WARLORD’S eyes

The WARLORD swings his razor sword at SHERLOCK’S head
SHERLOCK ducks and the sword embeds itself in the plaster
wall

SHERLOCK seizes the moment He dashes at his assailant with
a mighty force

Together they go crashing through the door straight
through the blacks and into the auditorium space

The crowd are momentarily stunned a Chinese WARLORD
wrestling on the floor with SHERLOCK HOLMES

SHERLOCK
John

JOHN dives on him The audience scatter screaming running
for the Exit signs

The WARLORD lands a punch on JOHN - sending him careering
into a curtain

THE BLIND BANKER SHOOTING (DRAFT 8) GREEN 16-02-10

He tears it down and it lands with a cloud of dust
Candles are extinguished Everywhere darker now

In the gloom ZHI ZHU scuttles down his silken skein and
disappears into the shadows

The WARLORD advances on SHERLOCK and lands another punch
SARAH seizes the wooden plank

She brings it crashing down on the head of the WARLORD She
runs over to rescue JOHN from the dusty chaos

SHERLOCK rips a shoe from the WARLORD He gazes there at a
tattoo on the man’s heel The Black Lotus

But the WARLORD is not concussed - merely stunned He kicks
out at SHERLOCK and staggers to his feet dizzy still
brandishing a sword

From the wings the OPERA SINGER appears - something in her
hand She points it at JOHN He flinches - instinctively
thinking it’s a gun

But it’s not It’s a mobile phone

She photographs him and smiles

JOHN knows he has seen her before - the WOMAN IN BLACK
The WARLORD is still advancing half-concussed but
flailing with his sword JOHN knows it’s time to retreat

He grabs SARAH by the wrist

JOHN
Hope you enjoyed your evening

SARAH
Just another date

JOHN
Damn And I wanted to make it
memorable

And with SHERLOCK they run off into the dark

Something valuable

DIMMOCK
Get what back

JOHN
We don’t know that

SHERLOCK is interested in SARAH for the very first time -
turns

SHERLOCK
How did you know

SARAH
Two words are translated here

She shows him the page she was looking at - the pages that
DIMMOCK brought back from the library in the evidence bag

There is a print-out of eighteen symbols grouped in nine
pairs

Sure enough - the first two number pairs have words written
underneath

SHERLOCK
How did you do that

Holmes we’d have done it by now We

they’re on the trail of something
special We haven’t found what we
seek but no matter Now we have
our own sniffer dog Sherlock
Holmes

A warmly familiar voice

SHERLOCK (0S)
You should you know

They turn SHERLOCK has found them

SHERLOCK
Sherlock Holmes is a great deal
more pompous With a ‘U’ Anda
great deal more what was the
word John

JOHN
Late

SHERLOCK swings a length of metal piping and knocks the
WARLORD out cold He rushes forward to save SARAH but

THE OPERA SINGER raises her gun and points it at him -
SHERLOCK stops in his tracks

The sandbag is still rising to the ceiling There is hardly
any time

SHERLOCK
(Looking at the gun)
That’s a semi-automatic You fire
it - the bullet will travel ata
thousand metres per second

THE OPERA SINGER
Well

SHERLOCK

Well these walls have a radius of
curvature of nearly four metres If
you miss then the bullet will
ricochet

(The Opera singer falters)
Who knows where You could hit
anyone The bullet could bounce
around the tunnel and hit you

THE OPERA SINGER
I have no intention of missing

SHERLOCK

Still I’d take those glasses off
Can’t shoot straight in the dark

THE BLIND BANKER SHOOTING (DRAFT 8) GREEN 16-02-10

And he lashes out and kicks over the burning brazier The
flames are immediately extinguished

SHERLOCK dives into the shadows - behind the oil drum
The OPERA SINGER fires and misses

The bullet ricochets around the tunnel narrowly missing
JOHN

Everywhere very dark now - just the meagre glow from the
candles

ZHI ZHU running at SHERLOCK in the shadows He reaches into
his pocket - pulls out a long skein of silk - lassoes it
over SHERLOCKS neck with expert precision

He drags SHERLOCK up towards him - spins more and more silk
around him and tugs it tight - the spider spinning a web
around his victim - choking him

SARAH writhing and squealing in her bonds The weight has
almost fallen the ballista about to fire

JOHN deliberately topples his chair over and using
scrabbling motions drags himself towards the loaded
ballista

The OPERA SINGER holds up the gun but she cannot squeeze the
trigger for fear of hitting her henchman

SHERLOCK being choked to death in the folds of silk ZHI ZHU
pulling hard They are locked together in a silk cocoon

JOHN finally crawls to the ballista still strapped to the
chair and lamely attempts to kick it over

96A
THE BLIND BANKER SHOOTING (DRAFT 8) GREEN 16-02-10
The sandbag is in the roof the weight is now inches close
to the spring mechanism

With one final kick JOHN topples the tripod The ballista
fires It misses SARAH and whistles straight past her

The bolt fires straight into ZHI ZHU’S heart
He releases SHERLOCK and his body falls to the ground
Beat They turn to look at the OPERA SINGER
She has gone
SHERLOCK runs over to SARAH He releases her from her bonds
and her gag JOHN smiles up at her still prostrate on the
floor

himself scented hand soap Not
unless he had a lady coming over
Same brand as that hand cream on
your desk there

AMANDA
I Look it wasn’t serious
between us It was over in a flash
It couldn’t last He was my boss
