disheveled hair and smokes incessantly

civilian clothes is bent over an open drawer loading film
into a hidden CAMERA They BOTH look toward a small TV
monitor screen

is discreetly placed

DR LAPPE -- standing on a chair watering one of the hanging
plants with a long-snouted watering-can -- just checks his
pocket-watch says nothing Turner ignores the inference

throws up his hands to protect his face -- The sten gun
goes FLYING

TURNER and THE MAILMAN - VARIOUS ANGLES

TURNER Lurches after it -- the MAILMANS FOOT TRIPS him He
starts up again glimpses something over his shoulder ducks
quick again --

Just in time because the MAILMAN literally PLIES OVER TURNER
with a FLYING SIDE KICK that wouldve broken his neck

The MAILMAN lands on a scatter-rug -- slides goes down

He may be a bit out of practice -- but hes still up faster
than TURNER and ready

looks at TURNER and the sten gun and smiles Makes a
bizarre exotic move he tests the hardwood floor with the
tip of his shoe -- a black loafer which TURNER should have
noticed

MAILMAN and TURNER

as the MAILMAN kicks off his shoes and drops into a
stance legs bent fists clenched left arm in front --
perpendicular to the floor -- right arm held close to the
waist

TURNER cant believe its going this way but tries to
imitate the stance

The MAILMAN moves slowly forward TURNER circles away to
the right They were 15 feet apart the MAILMAN closes to
10 8 and at 6 makes his MOVE

ANGLES

The MAILMAN YELLS feints a back-hand slap with his left
Anticipating TURNERs duck to the right he SPINS in a three-
quarter circle on the ball of his left foot -- sends his
right leg SHOOTING UP at TURNERs head

Somehow it just hits TURNERs swinging shoulder sends him
against the wall and as he BOUNCES off hes NICKED on the
left elbow by the MAILMANs ferocious follow-up handchop
