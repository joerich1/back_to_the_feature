1 EXT A STREET NEAR BRICK LANE - EVENING

Its 530pm in late December and rain is pouring The
scant Christmas decorations are hanging limp in the rain
A young Turk (EKREM) runs through the rain with a Turkish
newspaper held over his head He ducks into a traditional
barbers shop called Ozims

2 INT OZIMS BARBER SHOP - EVENING

The shutters are drawn OZIM (a plump middle-aged Turk)

is cutting the hair of the last customer of the day (SOYKA)
Soyka is a Chechen well-groomed wearing a sharp suit
beneath the barbers gown

During the conversation we glimpse distinctive eagle- and
star-shaped tattoos on Soykas arms and hands

Ozim and Soyka are chatting as Ekrem enters Soyka speaks
with a Russian accent

OZIM
Guvenilmez daginik bloody

SOYKA

Oi how much are you taking off

OZIM

Ozim brushes some hair off the customers shoulder and
Ozim finally acknowledges Ekrem who is shivering and wet
near to the door Ekrem turns the “Open sign to ‘Closed’

OZIM (CONTD)
They dont want to work do they
Shicma

EKREM

(hesitantly
interrupting)
Uncle Ozim

We see for the first time that Ekrem is shaking with fear
as well as cold

as if it were enchanted

OZIM
He looks OK yeah but he wont do

Ozim takes an open razor from behind a line of hair-tonic
bottles and hands it to Ekrem who now looks mortally
terrified

Soyka rises up from the seat casting off his barbers

gown Ozim yells “kabuka And Ekrem snarls flicks open

the razor and drags it across Soykas throat Soykas scream
bubbles in the blood

EXT KILBURN HIGH ROAD - NIGHT

We dissolve to a Christmas decoration flashing on and off
in the rain high on a lamp post in Kilburn High Road We
pan down the lamp post to the High Road where revelers are
hurrying through the rain We see a young girl (TATIANA)
hurrying across the street wrapped in a dressing gown
with a mans overcoat thrown over the top of it Her hair
is soaked as she approaches an all night chemists shop
She is barefoot

The CHEMIST is delivering advice in Gujurati to a CUSTOMER
Tatiana wipes rain from her face and the Chemist and the
customer react to her ragged appearance

blood trickling down her legs Tatiana looks down then

faints onto the floor

through double doors into the operating ward of Trafalgar

needle marks

A nurse searches through the contents of the handbag and
we can hear frantic activity from the operating table

Anna approaches the nurse who is rummaging through the
contents of the bag We see a business card from a
restaurant called “The Trans-Siberian a St Christopher

We need to get the baby out now

Aziz knows he can take Annas word

AZIZ
OK lets go

All hell is let loose As the Caesarean process begins at
frantic speed we slowly zoom in on Tatianas unconscious
face and hear her voice in VO a young girls voice
speaking with an Russian accent The crosstalk between
nurses and doctors becomes more and more frantic

TATIANA (VO)
My name is Tatiana My father
died in the mines in my village
so he was already buried when he
died We were all buried there
Buried under the soil of Russia
That is why I left to find a better
life

We hear a baby cry Annas face appears in our framed
shot of Tatianas face She gently kisses Tatianas cheek

ANNA

A sheet is pulled over Tatianas face A nurse weighs the
screaming baby Anna wipes her brow with the back of her

INT HELENS HOUSE KITCHEN - DAY

Anna is pouring two glasses of sherry Helen is peeling

share a moment of stifled emotion Helen wipes her eyes
with her sleeve

HELEN

(pause)
The smell of chicken roasting
reminds me of him

ANNA
You should have done beef then

They look at each other and giggle They both have potato
peelers in their wet hands sleeves rolled up two practical
unsentimental women being almost consumed by the same wave
of emotion

HELEN
It wouldnt be Christmas without
tears in the gravy would it

We hear a gruff Russian voice calling out from the living
room (UNCLE STEPAN)

STEPAN (VO)
(angry)
Anna Anna Where did you get
this

Anna and Helen roll their eyes

HELEN
(whispering)
Its your own fault for giving him

early seventies Russian He is reading the tiny diary
that Anna found in Tatianas bag Anna breezes in

ANNA

it in the handbag of a girl who
died in my ward

STEPAN
Do you always rob the bodies of
the dead
ANNA
(suppressed familiar
anger)

of the perks of working ina

Stepan grumbles accustomed to this teasing

Helen enters carrying a bowl of walnuts and brazil nuts
which she places on the table

the table cloth)
Lift your elbows

STEPAN

Stepan leaves in a huff Anna picks up the diary and begins
to study it She sees the “Trans-Siberian business card

between the pages

ANNA (CONTD)
How long will dinner be

Helen looks at Anna suspecting an attempt to escape

EXT LONDON STREETS - DAY

Driving music as we see Anna riding her motorbike through
deserted morning streets again We should begin to sense
that this is a kind of release for her We hear Tatiana
in VO

TATIANA (VO)
When I was little London was like
a place in the Bible I wasnt
even sure if it was real My friend
has told me there is a place in
London where they pay girls to
sing

PINK Revision - 111206 11

Anna arrives outside the “Trans-Siberian restaurant It
has a Russian-themed frontage in blue and gold expensively
and recently finished

TATIANA (VO) (CONTD)
He said if I sang in this restaurant
I would make more money in a week
than my father made in a year

As Anna pulls up we hear a dog begin to bark

EXT TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT SIDE ENTRANCE - DAY

The side door opens to reveal a hard-looking handsome
Russian man (NIKOLAI) who stops to groom his hair back
from his face and put on a pair of sunglasses as he emerges
into daylight He steps into a small courtyard where a
fierce Doberman dog is barking and snarling on the end of

a chain

Nikolai is followed by KIRILL who is a little younger
slim and pretty but hard-looking too Kirill is dressed in
a crumpled T-shirt and jeans and looks like he had a heavy
night Nikolai ignores the dog as he walks by but Kirill
yells at it and teases it with a whoop and few Russian
curses Nikolai unbolts the gate to the street

KIRILL
So you pick up Ozim and his bitch
of a wife and you bring them back
here

He glances back at the restaurant and speaks softly

KIRILL (CONTD)
Then Ill think of an excuse and
we can get away

NIKOLAI
Ill think of an excuse Your
excuses are like fucking fairy
tales

Kirill grins and Nikolai flicks the fob of his car keys
The lights on an expensive black Mercedes glow in response
Kirill notices Anna locking up her bike at the front of
the restaurant

KIRILL
Who the fucks that

PINK Revision - 111206 12

They both see Anna removing her crash helmet and shaking
out her hair She walks towards the front door

NIKOLAI
(in Russian)
Maybe somebody sent your dad a
hooker for Christmas

KIRILL
(grinning)
Youre so fucking unbelievably
disrespectful

Kirill sees that Nikolai is studying Anna and his grin
fades We sense jealousy

KIRILL (CONTD)
Hey youve got work to do Go

Kirill grabs Nikolais face to distract him gives hima
playful slap but there is somehow more to it than
playfulness Nikolai gets into his car

Kirill glares at Anna as she approaches the front of the
restaurant

EXT TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - DAY

As Nikolai drives away Anna rings the doorbell beside the
front door There is no reply She is about to ring again
when the door opens We see SEMYON a Russian man in his
late sixties He is wiping his hands on a tea towel
dressed in a spotlessly white apron He has the sparkling
piercing eyes of a falcon

SEMYON
We are closed

ANNA
I know

She fumbles in her bag

ANNA (CONTD)
Sorry Im a midwife

Anna produces her hospital ID and shows it to Semyon

BLUE Revision - 11406 13

through the restaurant leading Anna by the hand

SEMYON

Kirill follows Annas progress through the restaurant with
a glare

BLUE Revision - 11406 13A

There are three little girls in extravagant party frocks
all holding violins and giggling near to the door that

BLUE Revision - 11406 14

leads to the kitchen Semyon stops when he reaches them
and puts his hands on his hips
SEMYON (CONTD)

My angels You should be

Semyon grabs a violin and plays a three-second burst of
sad Russian violin music

SEMYON (CONTD)

You see

Semyon hurries on into the kitchen Anna smiles delighted

at the eccentric old man

INT TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT KITCHEN - DAY

Inside the kitchen there is an inferno of activity steam
smoke Family members some dressed in their party outfits
others in chefs uniforms are standing over steaming pots
laughing arguing Children play and yell You can almost
smell Christmas Anna enters dazzled by it all
overwhelmed by the contrast to her own lifeless Christmas
kitchen Semyon calls out to everyone

SEMYON
Come come hurry hurry They
will be here any moment

(to Anna)
Ok show me this card

Anna reaches into her pocket and produces the ‘Trans-
Siberian business card she found in Tatianas bag Semyon
angles his head to look as he stirs

SEMYON (CONTD)

It is the old card From before

the renovations But even so if

she had worked here I would remember
the name Perhaps she ate here

once Try this

Semyon offers Anna a spoonful of his gravy She sips it

ANNA
God thats amazing My dad made
gravy just like that

PINK Revision - 111206 15

Semyon shrugs and smiles his eyes twinkling then goes
back to stirring He speaks as if unconcerned

SEMYON
So did you get a chance to talk to
this girl before she died

EXT TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - DAY

Nikolais black Mercedes pulls up outside the restaurant
and parks a few inches from Annas motorbike The rear
windows are sun shaded so we only see Nikolai in the
drivers seat He gets out of the car and opens the rear
door of the car for an elegantly dressed Turkish lady in
her fifties Nikolai goes to the other rear door The
portly figure of Ozim the barber emerges As Ozim gets out
he gives Nikolai a fifty-pound note

INT TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT KITCHEN - DAY

Two of the little girl violinists are fighting pulling

each others hair The third is sobbing sitting on the

floor A young woman in a party dress is carrying a huge
silver bowl of sauce across the kitchen

Anna looks delighted at the noise and energy of the place
Finally Semyon emerges from a cloud of steam with a scrap
of paper

SEMYON
This is an agency that hires casual
kitchen staff Maybe you will
have more luck there But I think
they will be closed until New Year

As Anna takes the address Kirill puts his head around
the door and yells through the noise

KIRILL
Papa Ozim is here

Semyon is alarmed and claps his hand in urgent fashion

SEMYON
Ten minutes
(to the rest of the
kitchen)
Fish fish fish Ten minutes
OK Kirill get him a drink and
tell him I am coming

WHITE Revision - 91206

Semyon takes a pot from the heat suddenly flustered

SEMYON (CONTD)
Anna Im so sorry I couldnt help
It is sad

ANNA
Thats OK Ill probably find out
more when I get her diary

translated
SEMYON
Her diary
There is the tiniest of changes in Semyons manner He
lays his heavy pot down
ANNA

I found her diary in her bag

A pause Semyon disappears into a billow of steam to put
a pan onto the heat then re-emerges

SEMYON
Why did you not tell me you found
a diary

He peers at her for a moment his eyes hardening a little

SEMYON (CONTD)
OK Anna this is how it will be
You will bring the diary here and
I will translate it for you Then
if we get the names of any relatives
I will call them myself I am
something of a community leader
for the Russians here in this
unfriendly city What do you say

Semyon hoists a passing child into his arms

ANNA

SEMYON
(apparently not
hearing)

Anna heads for the door that leads back to the restaurant
Semyon goes back to stirring but as he stirs he calls out

SEMYON
Oh Anna you always work at the
Trafalgar hospital

ANNA
Yes always

A pause before Anna leaves Semyon to his clouds of steam
19 INT TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - DAY 19

Kirill and Ozim are talking confidentially in a mix of
Russian and Turkish whispers at a table Ozims wife is
at a table alone well out of their earshot smoking a
cigarette and peeling glazed figs As Anna walks by Ozim
and Kirill stop talking The scene has a much darker mood
to the bustling scene in the kitchen but for now Anna
feels no unease As she passes Kirill surveys her with a
deadly smile and a professional eye

KIRILL

Hey you OK You want a drink
ANNA

No thanks Im driving

As Anna smiles Ozim mumbles something in Turkish and Kirill
shushes him

PINK Revision - 111206 18

KIRILL
OK Merry Christmas Drive safely
Ozim giggles Anna departs

EXT TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - DAY

Anna emerges into the daylight As she does she sees that
four expensive-looking cars have already parked and various
ostentatiously dressed Russian and Turkish couples with
their children are emerging from their cars The women are
all wearing furs even the little girls The men wear
leather or dark suits They greet each other exuberantly
as they emerge from their cars Anna suddenly feels
slightly uneasy As she approaches her motorbike she sees
Nikolai leaning against the bonnet of his car smoking
still wearing shades His bumper is almost touching Annas
bike

NIKOLAI
(in Russian)
Nice bike

ANNA
What
NIKOLAI
Nice bike
ANNA
Thank you
NIKOLAI

A Ural You dont see them anymore

ANNA
It was my dads

NIKOLAI

How much do you want for it

Anna has already taken a dislike to this man He is
arrogant and looks potentially violent His shades suit
and tattoos say it all

ANNA
(irritated)
It has sentimental value

Nikolai rolls the concept around in his mind and considers

PINK Revision - 111206 18A

NIKOLAI

“Sentimental value Ive heard

of that
Anna puts her helmet on

BLUE Revision - 11406 19

NIKOLAI (CONTD)

ANNA
No

NIKOLAI

invited You want to go fora
drink instead

Anna mounts her bike

ANNA
Its Christmas Everythings
closed

Nikolai smiles

NIKOLAI
Sometimes if things are closed you
just open them up you know

Anna now feels intimidated and luckily the bike fires first
time She rides away Nikolai watches her go and then
stubs his cigarette

21 INT HELENS HOUSE DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Sudden silence perhaps the ticking of a clock This is
Annas Christmas dinner a total contrast to the chaos of
the restaurant Stepan is attempting to carve the chicken

STEPAN
Anna how come is it that your

Stepan takes a large sip of vodka

ANNA

ANNA
What the hell has that got to do

race That is why your baby died
inside you

Anna slams her napkin onto the table

HELEN
Stepan shut up
(Anna gets to her
feet)
Please Anna

Helen takes Annas hand but she turns and leaves Helen
stands to follow her but first she whips Stepans vodka
away from him

HELEN (CONTD)

we see pain loss shame emptiness isolation Tears begin
to roll from her eyes and then she is sobbing soundlessly

The Trans-Siberian restaurant is smoky with cigarettes and
cigars The party is in full swing with two dozen guests

violin badly The language is Russian English and Turkish
mixed Kirill is bringing a huge baked carp to the table
His mobile phone rings and he wipes his hands on a towel
to answer it

When he hears the voice Kirill glances at his father and
moves quickly out of earshot Semyon notices but hides
his concern As Kirill walks a child tugs his leg and
holds up a soft toy asking a question in Russian

The freezer door opens and Ozim gestures towards a large
package bound up in black bin liners which are dusted with
frost Kirill nods to Nikolai who grabs the package and
hauls it out onto the kitchen floor Kirill tears a hole
in the bin liner and we see the frost-dusted face of Soyka

BLUE Revision - 11406 25

Kirill studies the face and nods

KIRILL
Thats him

Kirill crosses himself

Hey hey show some respect for a

which he hands to Ozim As Ozim opens the envelope and
begins to count the huge wad of cash Kirill turns to
Nikolai

hard

NIKOLAI

INT OZIMS BARBER SHOP KITCHEN - NIGHT

We cut close to an ancient-looking hair dryer from the
shop downstairs being trained onto a human hand with a
large eagle tattoo We pull wide to reveal the full
gruesome scene

WHITE Revision - 91206 26

Nikolai has the body of Soyka laid out on a surface his
head still bound up in a bin bag his lower portions bound
up similarly Nikolai is de-frosting Soykas left hand

with the hair dryer concentrating on his ring finger which
has a gold ring on it The parts of Soykas shirt and
jacket which are visible are crusted with frozen blood
Nikolai is wearing rubber gloves

As he dries Nikolai takes a sip of coffee Ozim is
watching this scene with horror Kirill has his arms
folded mightily impressed

Finally the hand is thawed enough for Nikolai to remove
the gold ring He studies an inscription and then offers
it to Ozim Ozim shakes his head as if the thing were a
contagion Nikolai shrugs and pockets it He then turns
the hair dryer back on and blows some hot air onto the
crisply bloody chest of Soyka He tugs at the frozen lapel
of the jacket and blows air into the inside pocket Within
a few moments he is able to remove Soykas glistening
thawing wallet which is caked in frozen blood He opens

it (we glimpse a photo of a wife and children) and blows
hot air onto the money inside

He tugs a wad of frozen bank notes from the wallet all
stuck together by drops of frozen blood He offers this
money to Ozim as well but Ozim shakes his head vigorously
Kirill hoots with laughter Ozim is now staring at Nikolai
as if he were a devil from hell

Nikolai grabs a plastic bag and puts the money inside it
then pockets the frozen wad He tosses the rest of the
frozen wallet to Ozim who instinctively catches it

NIKOLAI
Youd better burn that

Ozim reacting to the cold of the wallet and to the horror
of it drops the thing on the floor Nikolai looks at
Ozim as if he were a complete amateur

NIKOLAI (CONTD)
Did you finish cutting his hair

Ozim cant answer
NIKOLAI (CONTD)

I just thought you might want six-
fifty out of his pockets

BLUE Revision - 11406 27

Kirill laughs Nikolai takes a deep breath to prepare
himself
NIKOLAI (CONTD)
OK now Im going to do his teeth
and cut off his fingers
(to Ozim)

You might want to leave the room

Ozim thinks decides leaves fast A pause

NIKOLAI (CONTD)
You too Kirill

Kirill smiles and pats Nikolai on the cheek

Kirill leaves Nikolai is left alone His hand shakes a
little as he picks up his cup of coffee

EXT NINE ELMS ABANDONED DOCK - MORNING

Nikolai pulls up beside a rusting crane on the abandoned
dock in a dry-cleaners van Kirill watches as Nikolai
grabs the semi-thawed body now bagged and tied lifts it
onto his shoulder and smartly approaches the dockside

KIRILL
Arent you going to weight him
down or something

Nikolai drops the body into the water with a splash

NIKOLAI
If you want to dump a body this
is the place The currents keep
it under the surface until past
the barrier

Nikolai and Kirill watch as the body is swallowed by a
fast ocean-bound current

INT TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Semyon sits alone at the dinner table in the restaurant
where before there was family and uproar Outside its
dark and raining He is reading a Russian crime novel A
half-empty bottle of vodka sits on the table

Tatianas voice-over continues as we cut inside the
restaurant

TATIANA (VO)

My friend says his uncle owns the

and drank vodka Tomorrow I will
translate it

He folds the papers carefully

SEMYON (CONTD)

perhaps remembers Nikolai Finally

ANNA

Semyon stares at her for a moment

doorway As she turns Kirill stumbles forwards and collapses
in front of her Nikolai looks up at Anna his face

splashed with rain

NIKOLAI (CONTD)
What You never seen anybody pissed

Semyon looks down at the drunken Kirill and slams the door
of the restaurant Nikolai sighs then turns to Kirill
and starts to go through his pockets

NIKOLAI (CONTD)
Come on Kirill Where are your
keys

Anna walks around the two of them watching the undignified
struggle as Nikolai finds Kirills keys Nikolai smiles
at her

NIKOLAI (CONTD)
Who are you anyway

Anna hurries away into the rain Nikolai finds Kirills
keys and drags him toward the door of the restaurant

INT TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Nikolai heaves Kirill into a chair Semyon is back at his
novel and watches as Kirill attempts to get to his feet
and then stumbles to the floor He slumps down now
totally unconscious breathing deeply Nikolai smiles

NIKOLAI
We went to a Kurdish place They
dont even celebrate Christmas

Semyon steps up to where Kirill is lying and stands over
him for a moment Then he kicks him hard in the guts with
all his might Nikolai is shocked and grabs Semyons
arm A hand laid upon him is like deadly poison Kirill

grunts and moans

Nikolai reaches into his pocket for a business card and
offers it to Semyon As Semyon looks at the card in the

Somewhere within sight of the Thames barrier

A dozen policemen and forensic investigators are milling

at their feet

is not dressed for the weather He has obviously been
dragged out of bed He is led to the side of the body

One of the officers pulls up the dead mans hand and shows
him the eagle tattoo

OFFICER
We think he might be Russian Mafia

Yuri studies the tattoo then borrows a torch He crouches
to push up the wet trouser leg on the corpses right leg
When the knee is exposed in torch light we see a small
star tattooed on the knee cap

YURI
He is actually a Chechen He is
also a member of the vory v zakone
The stars on the knees mean he
would never kneel before anyone

Yuri opens the dead mans shirt and we see a tattoo of an
eight-pointed star on his chest

YURI (CONTD)
In Russian prisons your life story
is written on your body in tattoos
You dont exist without tattoos

We are in HARLESDEN NORTH LONDON
A large portable stereo is playing rock music

The curtains are drawn against daylight The living room
is decorated in seventies suburban style but with the
wall paper peeling and the paint work fading Kitsch
paintings still decorate the walls

Six young East-European girls are sitting on a broken-down
sofa and on hard-backed chairs wearing short skirts Their
eyes are sunken and their faces vacant of expression but
they are painted with so much make-up they almost look

like tiny sad clowns

They sit in silence as the music blares out After a few
moments a young Albanian man enters and claps his hands

BLUE Revision - 11406 41

ALBANIAN
OK boss is here Boss boss
You make him happy

All the girls apart from one immediately get to their feet
and begin to dance to the music their bodies moving
awkwardly and painfully The Albanian approaches the one
girl who refused to stand and yanks her to her feet

He slaps her hard and hisses at her in Albanian She tries
to sit down again but he pulls her up and slaps her again
Finally he shoves her into the middle of the room and she
begins to dance sobbing as she does

ALBANIAN (CONTD)
No fucking crying Its a party

dancing with the girls Some of the girls are drinking
too and managing to laugh Kirill is dancing maniacally
and swinging his girl around faster and faster until she
falls over

Nikolai swigs his drink and notices the girl who refused
to stand up She is standing in the corner sobbing
Nikolai doesnt care to look at her for more than a second
and he goes back to dancing

After a moment Kirill dances his way over to Nikolai and
yells above the music

KIRILL
OK which one you going to fuck

all fours registering no emotion

Kirill is leaning against the wall drinking wine from the

drunken jealousy mixing together Nikolai grits his teeth
and comes inside the girl Kirill whoops and whistles and
begins to applaud
The girl is still silent expressionless

KIRILL
You did OK You did OK

Nikolai glares at Kirill

Kirill grins and offers the girl an elaborate bow before
leaving Finally alone Nikolai gently helps the girl to
lie down She is numb He covers her up with a blanket
then begins to pull on his clothes The girl is staring up
at the ceiling

After a few moments she begins to sing a Russian folk song
softly under her breath Nikolai speaks to her softly in
Russian

INT TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL SCBU CHRISTINES PRIVATE ROOM
NIGHT

In the half-lit private room Anna is dancing with Christine
in her arms She is singing a lullaby softly to her The
door is open to the rest of the ward and all the other
babies are silent

Finally she lays a sleeping Christine back in her crib
She sits down on the bed where the mother should be She
curses herself silently and gets to her feet determined
to pull herself together

As she starts to leave the private room to enter the ward
she is suddenly confronted by Semyon

He is standing in the shadows a Bavarian trilby in his
hands Anna gasps with shock Semyon speaks softly

SEMYON
Hello Anna I came on tiptoes

ANNA

Anna glances at an alarm button
ANNA
Youre not allowed in here
SEMYON
Please Anna let me speak
Semyon looks to be almost in tears He speaks softly

SEMYON (CONTD)
I translated the diary

A baby begins to cry and is comforted somewhere across the
ward

SEMYON (CONTD)

I was shocked to discover that
my son Kirill is mentioned many
times

Semyon appears to be fighting tears

SEMYON (CONTD)
I have known for some years that
he has strayed from the path I set
out for him His mother died when
he was very young

A pause Anna almost begins to buy his sorrow

ANNA
What does it say about him

Semyon looks up his eyes filled with tears

SEMYON
Many bad things

A pause

SEMYON (CONTD)
But Anna please Let me deal with

him If the diary should find its
way to the police

Semyon wipes his eyes
SEMYON (CONTD)

Some of the things my son did are
illegal Anna he is a good boy

PINK Revision - 111206 47

A pause
ANNA

I dont care about him I care
about the baby

SEMYON

Of course Of course And that is

the baby

Semyon glances over Annas shoulder into the corner where

Christine is sleeping Anna freezes and doesnt reply
Semyon takes her hand

SEMYON (CONTD)
I have made some inquiries
and I have found out an address
for Tatianas family in Russia
Thats where the baby belongs

Anna

no

Anna reacts but Semyons face suddenly hardens

SEMYON (CONTD)
So perhaps we can do a deal

He stares into her eyes

SEMYON (CONTD)
Do you understand me Anna

At that moment a nurse walks by and hesitates when she
sees Semyon

NURSE
Anna
ANNA
Its OK Hes just leaving

Semyon puts his hat onto his head

SEMYON
You know where I am Anna Ivanovna

He turns
SEMYON (CONTD)
And I know where you are
Semyon disappears into the shadows of the ward As Anna

reacts we hear Tatiana in VO

I was thrown down the stairs and
fell onto some sacks like potato
sacks

INT HELENS HOUSE KITCHEN - DAY

Stepan is sitting at the kitchen table translating
Tatianas diary aloud as Helen transcribes it onto a note

pad Stepans translation breaks up with emotion but he
tries to remain detached Helen also tries hard to
concentrate on her task but wipes away a tear as she writes
Tatianas VO slowly blends into Stepans voice

STEPAN
like potato sacks Kirill came
down after me and he hit me until
I was bleeding Then he tried to
rape me but he couldnt do it
He just got madder and madder and
kept hitting me In the end his
father came down It was the father
who raped me He shouted at his
sonif you dont break a horse
it will never be tame Kirill

They hear a key in the door and prepare for Annas arrival
When she enters she feels the tense silence After a
moment Helen tries to be bright

HELEN
Hello dear How was your night

Anna sees the tears in both their eyes She sees the diary
and the transcription and sits down

HELEN (CONTD)
Stepans arthritis is playing up
Im taking dictation
Helen gets to her feet

Stepan heads for the kitchen cupboard and produces a bottle
of vodka Rather than admonish him Anna and Helen both

nod agreement Stepan pours three large vodkas Stepan
knocks his down Anna and Helen take sips

HELEN
And then he would have been
practical

STEPAN

He would ask if there were bullets
for the gun

gets to his feet and points to the diary

STEPAN
She was an ordinary person

the situation up

Kirill is about to speak but before he can Nikolai speaks
for him

NIKOLAI (CONTD)
It was a matter of honor Soyka
was spreading lies about Kirill
About your family
(in Russian)
Kirill did the right thing

Semyon hisses with fury and grabs Nikolai

SEMYON
I decide what is right and what is
wrong You do not kill a vor for
no reason

Nikolai shrugs Semyon off holding his ground

NIKOLAI
You know as well as I do Soyka was
talking to the police

A pause Semyon is shocked at the depth of Nikolais
knowledge He peers at him

SEMYON
For a driver you are well informed

NIKOLAI
Ive got connections with the
Chechens who export cars Soyka
was speaking to the Russian desk
Scotland Yard

PINK Revision - 111206 56

In Semyons silence Kirill finally gathers courage

KIRILL
Papa I swear to you I was going
to
SEMYON

Kirill is hurt that Semyon seems only to be interested in
Nikolai After studying Nikolai for a while

SEMYON (CONTD)
If you are so well informed you
will know Soyka has brothers

NIKOLAI
(with a smile)
Thats OK Kirill has got me

Semyon shows the first flicker of admiration He then
looks at Kirill with utter contempt making the comparison
with Nikolai obvious

ANNA (CONTD)
You murdered her You bastards

Passers-by stare at Anna Helen and Stepan have come out

of the restaurant to restrain her Nikolai stops and judges
the fury on Annas face He speaks calmly

NIKOLAI
Anger is very dangerous It makes
people do stupid things Forget

in the wrong place Anna Ivanovna

He gestures at the burger restaurant

NIKOLAI (CONTD)
You belong in there With nice
people Stay away from people
like me

Anna and Nikolai are staring at each other suddenly a
strange connection between them

Then Stepan steps forward and spits in Nikolais face
delivering a Russian curse as he does so Nikolai almost
reacts out of instinct but stops himself

Nikolai wipes his face and peers into Annas eyes Finally
he gets into his car and drives away

TATIANA (VO) (CONTD)
Sometimes I think this is alla
hallucination

He sees Semyon approaching from the kitchen and closes the
diary Semyon grabs a bottle of vodka from the bar on his
way to sit opposite Nikolai Nikolai pushes the diary
across the table Semyon pours two drinks

SEMYON
It is good to have someone who I
can trust to do simple tasks

A pause as Semyon glances at a few pages of diary

SEMYON (CONTD)
In this business sometimes the
biggest danger comes from the most
stupid things You cant afford
to be careless in any area

Nikolai senses a change of attitude towards him As if
Semyon were beginning to accept him into the fold Semyon

raises a toast

SEMYON (CONTD)

Nasdrovia
NIKOLAI
Nasdrovia
After a moment
SEMYON

So what was the lie that Soyka was
spreading about my son

Nikolai looks anxious

NIKOLAI
(in Russian)
It was nothing important

SEMYON
Kirill had him killed for nothing
important

Semyon pours two more vodkas

NIKOLAI
I dont want to repeat it

PINK Revision - 111206 61

SEMYON
(smiling)
For me you will repeat it

Nikolai doesnt respond It is obvious that Semyon half
knows already He shrugs

SEMYON (CONTD)
You play with the Prince to do
business with the King But if
you want to do business with me
you must be open with me Thieves-
in-law

A pause Semyon nurses his vodka

SEMYON (CONTD)
What was Soyka saying about the

Prince
He stares into Nikolais eyes Finally Nikolai stammers
NIKOLAI
That he is a drunk And that he
is also a queer

Semyon swigs his vodka and Nikolai swigs his Semyon pours
two more Semyon has to stare out of the window to hide
his emotion

SEMYON
(softly in Russian)
My only son

They both knock their drinks back Semyon looks suddenly
angry as he peers out of the window

SEMYON (CONTD)
You know it never snows in this
City And its never hot London
is a city of whores and queers
My son

Semyon shrugs fighting deeper emotion

SEMYON (CONTD)
I think London is to blame for
what he is

WHITE Revision - 91206 62

NIKOLAI
So why dont you go home

Semyon smiles as if seeing Moscow through the window

SEMYON
The cold gets into my bones

A pause

SEMYON (CONTD)
And also the KGB would be waiting
for me

Nikolai smiles ruefully and glances at Semyon

NIKOLATI
FSB They are called FSB now

SEMYON
Whatever they call them they are
worse even than the KGB were Maybe
the KGB and the vory v zakone were
partners in a marriage We had
rules they had rules

He swigs some more vodka

SEMYON (CONTD)
Now in Moscow the thieves dont
wear tattoos and the police dont
wear uniforms You never know who
they are

Semyon seems to be taking the vodka less well than Nikolai
He pours some more
SEMYON (CONTD)
Youve heard about these new
policemen

Nikolai doesnt blink

SEMYON (CONTD)
They get under you over you behind
you inside you They are the
ones you least expect

Semyon peers at Nikolai and Nikolai doesnt respond
Mention of the new breed of FSB agent causes an almost
imperceptible tension in Nikolai

PINK Revision - 111206 63

52 Is Semyon too drunk to notice There is a strange game
going on here For now nothing is revealed

Semyon knocks back his vodka and Nikolai does the same
Semyon picks up the diary and holds it into the flame of
the candle It begins to burn and he drops it into the
ashtray The flames flicker for a while

SEMYON (CONTD)
The midwife said she had an uncle
A Russian

NIKOLAI
I met him

SEMYON
So you know what he looks like

Semyon peers at Nikolai

SEMYON (CONTD)
She said he has read the diary

A pause

SEMYON (CONTD)
We cant trust a Russian with that
kind of information

A pause

SEMYON (CONTD)
(in Russian)
Do you understand me

Semyon gets to his feet and smiles

SEMYON (CONTD)
Perhaps you can deal with him

Semyon leaves Nikolai to stare into the flames of the
burning diary

vicious yelling between the two groups Police are visibly
keeping order

his neck and is looking for trouble jeering at the Chelsea
supporters across the street

them grabs his Arsenal scarf and begins to strangle him

to escape

Inside a restaurant like this with its danger and vibrancy
Suddenly she is illuminated by headlights She turns and
sees that Nikolai is pulling up in his Mercedes Kirill is
in the passenger seat Nikolai gets out of the car and
stops when he sees Anna Anna is like a fox caught in

He goes for Anna again and this time Nikolai shoves Kirill
to the wet ground He looks up at Nikolai and slowly gets
to his feet He wipes his hands then stares into Nikolais
eyes

Nikolai has taken what Anna said on board He speaks

softly

Semyon stares at Kirill and Kirill knows the look

Kirill hesitates He is angry as hell but too scared of
his fathers gaze to say anything Finally he turns fast
and departs slamming his open hand against the door as he
goes

Semyon waits a moment before returning to the business of
cutting the cake Finally

long swig as Nikolai joins him He grins as he gestures
at the brandy

KIRILL

Nikolai sits down on a crate rests his head against the

like a stab in the back Finally Kirill swallows a huge
swig of brandy then turns awkwardly to hug Nikolai He
squeezes him hard for a long time then shoves him away

PINK Revision - 111206 79 67

NIKOLAI
Yes I have no mother and no

have always followed

VALERY

above your heart Where the stars

The questions and answers are delivered with great
solemnity making the ceremony feel almost religious

Semyon is silent throughout but listens attentively
Towards the end of the interview there is the ghost of a
smile on the Gypsys face and this pleases Semyon

only his underpants We circle Nikolai as the tattooist
begins to work on his knees preparing Nikolais knee caps
for the tattoos

The needle bites at Nikolais skin as the old tattooist
wipes away the blood

Then we see the needle working on the empty spaces above
Nikolais heart tattooing the star symbol

Nikolai now has a star tattoo on each knee and two eight-
pointed stars on his chest He is now a member of the vory

apart from an OLD TURKISH BATH-HOUSE ATTENDANT who is
distributing towels Ozim is unbuttoning his shirt

OZIM
Semyon recommends these places for
business meetings because you can
see what tattoos a man has

Nikolai is pulling off his shirt and Ozim reacts to the

chuckles

leans back against the cold wall his tattoo almost the
only visible thing through the steam

INT TURKISH BATHS CHANGING ROOM - DAY

Ozim is dressing frantically his face suddenly betraying
his real anxiety He checks his watch as he puts it back
on his wrist

After a moment the two Chechen brothers who killed Ekrem
enter the changing room They swagger up to Ozim

Ozim slaps his chest to denote the place where they will
see the vor tattoo They head towards the steam room as
Ozim grabs his shoes and hurries towards the exit

INT TURKISH BATHS STEAM ROOM - DAY

Nikolai is sweating hard staring at the ceiling The
steam room door opens but the steam is now so thick he
cant see who has entered

NIKOLAI
Ozim

He sees a shape a clothed body He realizes immediately
Suddenly one of the brothers is upon him and has him ina
head lock He strokes the tattoo on Nikolais chest as if
this were confirmation of who this is He grunts an
instruction and his brother emerges through the steam with
an open razor

Nikolai is naked alone

Suddenly he kicks the razor guy in the balls and uses a
martial arts chop to free himself from the other brother
In the steam there are boots and bare feet and knees and
fingers flying Nikolai manages to gouge the eye of one
brother and throw another against the wall He obviously
has serious combat training but the brothers are strong
and angry

Suddenly Nikolai is slashed across the arm by the razor
and blood oozes into the steam and hot water All the men
are slipping and falling on the blood and hot water
Another slash of the razor cuts his thigh open All the
men are now covered in blood and Nikolai with a final
surge of strength manages to cripple one brother with a
blow to the throat and the other with an elbow to the
temple

As the Chechens slump to the floor Nikolai fumbles in the
bloody water for the razor finds it kneels and slashes
their throats He lurches to his feet drops the razor
and staggers out of the steam room

on his chest scaring her even more

thirsty swig Finally

first-class ticket

A pause

He is of the old school He
understood the situation Exile

He said they throw a great party
at New Year And he said it was a
good excuse to get away from his

Its cold and the wind is blowing We see rooftops behind
them Yuri is lighting Nikolais cigarette Nikolai is

wearing Yuris overcoat loosely over his hospital gown
Yuri lights his own cigarette and they smoke in silence
for a moment

NIKOLAI
You got my message

Yuri chuckles

YURI
Using a dead body to file a progress
report must be against FSB
regulations

NIKOLAI
Its called improvisation

YURI
Youve been improvising quite a
lot lately And taking risks

He glances at the cuts on Nikolais hands

YURI (CONTD)
(in Russian)
Maybe too many

Nikolai suddenly glares at Yuri

NIKOLAI
(in Russian)
You didnt come here to give me
flowers

Yuri shakes his head and prepares to deliver bad news
Nikolai turns as if to go back inside Yuri grabs Nikolais
arm and speaks formally

PINK Revision - 111206

YURI
In light of what has happened to
you

Nikolai shakes his head wearily

NIKOLAI
(in Russian)
Ah Christ
YURI

and in light of other violent
incidents associated with you the
Russian desk at Scotland Yard have
made an official request to the
Russian embassy that your undercover
operation in London be terminated

Nikolai doesnt react for a moment

YURI (CONTD)
(in Russian)
You have gone beyond what was
agreed

With his cigarette dangling from his mouth Nikolai begins
to unbutton his overcoat

YURI (CONTD)
In my opinion you should see this
as good news Youve been in the
zone far too long

Nikolai turns and slowly pulls open the overcoat and the
thin hospital gown beneath it

He reveals the eight-pointed star tattoos on his chest and
Yuri reacts with absolute astonishment

YURI (CONTD)
My God

NIKOLAI
If they terminate the operation
now they will be wasting this

A pause Yuri looks shocked and slightly horrified
Nikolai too suddenly seems almost ashamed that he has got
this far After a long silence Nikolai mumbles

stars over my heart OK Tell
them Im through the door

you kill

Tell them I only killed myself

A pause Yuri is humbled They share a moment of
understanding as they smoke Finally

NIKOLAI (CONTD)
And you can tell them Im going to
replace Semyon at the head of the
London organization

Yuri laughs

YURI
What drugs are they giving you
Maybe its the anesthetic speaking

NIKOLAI
I need you to take Semyon out of
the picture I want you to arrest
him

Nikolai lights another cigarette from the stub of the one
he is smoking Yuri is incredulous

YURI
Arrest him for what

NIKOLAI
Rape

Yuri begins to chuckle

NIKOLAI (CONTD)
The girl was fourteen

BLUE Revision - 11406

YURI
(incredulous)
And of course she will testify

NIKOLAI
She doesnt have to Shes dead

A pause

NIKOLAI (CONTD)
But she had Semyons baby If you
prove the baby is his and prove
the girl was under age when the
baby was conceived thats statutory
rape

A pause Yuri begins it think it through

NIKOLAI (CONTD)
All you need is the baby and some
of Semyons DNA For poetic reasons
I suggest you take his blood

Yuri peers at Nikolai with awe A long pause

Yuri smiles

YURI
You intrigue me

A pause

YURI (CONTD)
If we had never had this
conversation they would have sent
you home You could have spent
the Spring in the mountains Riding
your bicycle to your office every
morning through fields of flowers

Instead of answering Anna lays the clothes on the bed

ANNA

Theyre from the morgue They
belonged to someone who died
yesterday

Nikolai picks up the jeans and examines them Theyre way

too big

ANNA (CONTD)
I cant believe Im doing a favor
for someone just because he had
the decency not to murder a member
of my family

Nikolai smiles but Anna turns to leave

Hey wait a minute

Nikolai steps behind the bed screen to pull on the jeans
He speaks from behind the screen

NIKOLAI (CONTD)
Is your bike still working OK

A pause Anna considers leaving but hesitates
ANNA
Yeah Its OK

Nikolai steps out from behind the screen the baggy jeans
tightly belted his chest bare For the first time Anna
sees the extent of Nikolais body tattoos and reacts

Nikolai sees her reaction to the tattoos and doesnt care
for it He grabs the T-shirt and pulls it on

like people ahead of me
Kirill is now unnerved by Semyons quiet confusion He

watches as Semyon grabs at the bottle of vodka to drink
He speaks softly as he swigs

Kirill smiles through his tears and nods

NIKOLAI (CONTD)

A pause Kirill dries his eyes and heads for the car
Nikolai looks at Anna who is hugging the baby He waits
a long time before realizing he must leave her

NIKOLAI (CONTD)
Youre OK yeah

Anna nods
ANNA

helped us

102 Nikolai cant answer truthfully though he longs to do so
There is a long pause before he manages to finds a suitable

lie
NIKOLATI
How can I become King if the King
is still in place
A pause He laughs

Anna studies him unsure More New Year fireworks explode
over the river Kirill yells from the car

KIRILL

(in Russian)
Thats a fucking order

Nikolai and Anna peer at each other

NIKOLATI

She shakes her head

ANNA

Nikolai nods not liking the information but hiding it
Nikolai comes close and gently uncovers Christines face
He smiles Kirill is hooting the car horn

After a moment Nikolai and Anna kiss each other gently
before Nikolai heads for the car

INT HELENS HOUSE KITCHEN - DAY

A summers day Anna Helen and Uncle Stepan are preparing
to eat Sunday lunch Stepan is carving The conversation
is jovial as Anna and Helen bring dishes of food to the
table

Then we hear a baby crying Anna goes to a small crib and
lifts a six-month-old Christine out She hands her to
Helen who hugs her Over this happy scene we hear Tatiana
in VO a repeat of the first words we heard her say

TATIANA (VO)
My name is Tatiana My father
died in the mines in my village
so he was already buried when he
died

Anna takes Christine back and takes her to the window to
peer outside staring across the park

INT TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - SAME DAY

Nikolai is sitting at a window table alone sipping vodka
staring back across the park He peers out at ordinary
life going on in the streets outside Tatianas VO
continues

TATIANA (VO)
We were all buried there Beneath
the soil of Russia That is why I
left to find a better life

Nikolai finishes his drink

THE END
