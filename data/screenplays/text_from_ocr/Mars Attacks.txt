The sound of a TRACTOR is heard approaching An old

FARMER

MR LEE a Filipino in his late 40s comes out of a side
door of the farmhouse He is carrying garbage

He goes down the path to the trash cans next to the mail-
box He waves to the Hillbilly approaching on the
tractor

The Hillbilly comes to a stop He frowns and wrinkles
his nose

HILLBILLY
Howdy Mister Lee What is this
Filipino New Years

MR LEE
No Why you say that

HILLBILLY
‘Cause youre cooking up a feast
You can smell it all the way from
the interstate What is it -- a
barbecue

Mr Lee sniffs He can smell it too

MR LEE
Oh yes
(mystified)
But its not coming from here

The THUNDEROUS ROAR of a thousand head of STAMPEDING
CATTLE becomes audible in the distance

HILLBILLY
Whats that noise

The RUMBLING ROAR GETS CLOSER Its coming from behind

the house The sound becomes DEAFENING The ground
shakes

( )

MRS LEE her two children and dog run out of the house
The children are screaming They join Mr Lee at the
tractor

HILLBILLY
Oh my Lord

A herd of burning cows appear from behind the house and
stampede across the garden -- like a river of flame
Mrs Lee pulls her children up on to the tractor

The cattle gallop past them and away across the wide
field -- into the night

Then theres a strange THROBBING NOISE

In the distance rising through the sky is a flying
saucer The flying saucer shoots straight up at
hyper-speed For a moment it is a silver dot in the
nightsky then it is gone

You mean they can read our

KESSLER
Potentially yes

Decker scowls all the way through the meeting He is not
happy

PRESIDENT
What about their intentions Are
they friendly

KESSLER
Logic dictates that given their
extremely high level of technical
development they are an advanced
culture -- therefore peaceful and
enlightened The human race on
the other hand is a dangerously
aggressive species I suspect
they have more to fear from us
than we from them Doctor

Kessler stands to one side as Zeigler crosses to where
an elaborate computer is set up

DOCTOR ZEIGLER
(German accent)

Thank you Professor For many
years I have been refining a

broken down 227 phonemes 48
diphthongs and 292 other sounds

range

I have run the Martian transmission
through seven different linguistics
programs The results are not
perfect but this may answer some
of your questions

Ambassador is heard Doctor Zeigler adjusts some
controls Computer tapes revolve and then a synthesized
voice speaks

For us applause is sign of
approval of approbation and

it may be offensive -- a sign of
aggression if you will Symbols
are not universal For example
among the hill tribes of New
Guinea if you smile it means
youre sad and if you frown
youre happy

and being filmed by a student TV crew In the crowd
watching them proudly are 4 handful of survivors --
including Louise Cedric and Neville their guns stuck
in their belts

On the steps holding two medals is Taffy Behind her
are two elderly mailmen

Medal of Honor The highest
decoration our nation can bestow

She hangs the medal around Grandmas neck -- and kisses
her on both cheeks

Shes beautiful She looks at him looking at her -- and
blushes Then she recovers herself and

TAFFY
Richard Norris on behalf of my
parents -- who couldnt be here

the Martians I hereby award you
the Medal of Honor

She puts the medal around his neck And is about to kiss
his cheek but hesitates She is very attracted to him
and it makes her shy
