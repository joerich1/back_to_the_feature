FADE IN
INT A MENTAL HOSPITAL - DAY

A few patients sit around fumbling with themselves One man
sits at a table scratching back and forth on a piece of paper
with a crayon Another stands in a corner smoking a cigarette
and staring at the crayon guy This is CHARLES Another man
KARL sits in a chair staring at the floor and rubbing his
hands together We cut back and forth between Charles staring
and Crayon Man scratching After a moment an attendant
approaches Charles

ATTENDANT
You cant smoke in here

Charles stares at him blankly for a moment and continues
smoking He looks back to Crayon Man again for a moment then
looks over at Karl and then goes and sits down beside him

CHARLES
A Mercury is a good car and thats
what I was driving that day Ive
owned a lot of cars Different
kinds Lots of different kinds of
cars She was standing this girl
on the side of the street where
there was a chicken stand not the
Colonel mind you but nevertheless
a chicken stand and I pulled the
Mercury over and rolled down the
window by electric power She was
wearing a leather skirt and she had
a lot of hair on her arms I like
that I like it a lot It means a
big bush I like a big bush She
said Are you dating I said
yes and she got in the car We
pulled to a remote location one
that she and I both felt
comfortable with and she said How
much can you spend I said What
it takes to see your bush I know
its a big one She said twenty
five dollars which to a working
man is not chicken feed I produced
the money and she put it in her
shoe and pulled up her skirt There
before me lay a thin crooked
uncircumcised penis You can
imagine how badly I wanted my
twenty-five dollars back
INT A HALLWAY - DAY

Two young women MARSHA DWIGGINS carrying a briefcase and
THERESA EVANS carrying two camera bags are being led down
the hallway by a GUARD

THERESA
I dont know why youre so weirded

MARSHA

INT AN OFFICE - DAY

MARSHA
Yes sir

WOOLRIDGE

I think there must have been a
little mix up I told your sponsor
or teacher or whatever he is there
couldnt be any pictures Its
sposed to be just a little story
or article or something isnt that
right

MARSHA
Well yeah its for the school
newspaper But it has pictures I
mean its a regular paper you
know

WOOLRIDGE

Karls real sensitive about having
his picture made He wouldnt even
be on the bulletin board for the
Easter Collage

(to guard)
Melvin would you get me a good hot
cup with two sugar substitutes You
girls want some coffee

MARSHA
No thank you

WOOLRIDGE

The other thing is I told your boss
on the phone to send a man Karl
wont talk to women

INT REC ROOM - DAY
CLOSE UP on Karls face Charles has started another
monologue

CHARLES
There was a young man named John
Liggit Hunter who was in the
filling station business and a good
filling station business He was
one of those young men that we run
across so often in life Im sure
youve run across them that didnt
deserve the things he had One of
those things was his beautiful
bride Sarah She was a Georgia
Peach As a matter of fact she
looked more like the picture Ive
had in my head than any woman Ive
ever seen I took it upon myself to
take her away from John Liggit
Hunter who didnt deserve her Im
not sure if I mentioned that he was
a Frenchman who claimed to be an
Englishman It took some very
strong nylon cord to take her away
from him She was a fighter as well
as a Georgia Peach

INT WOOLRIDGES OFFICE
The girls look confused

WOOLRIDGE
I dont know what to tell you Im
sorry I made myself pretty clear I
thought He probably got busy and
wasnt thinking I know how that
is I used to teach shop and eighth
grade science

MARSHA
Well what do we do We drove all
the way out here

THERESA
Lets just go Marsha

MARSHA
No we have to get this story

THERESA

people Hes very troubled

INT REC ROOM

CHARLES
(leaning in to Karl)
A shovel just makes too goddamn
much racket

INT WOOLRIDGES OFFICE

WOOLRIDGE

(takes a drink of coffee)
I dont think hes talked to a
woman in twenty-five or so years
That I know of anyway Thats why I
said to send a man At least maybe

college out believe me It might
be a real good article or story

MARSHA

interviewer Just get me in the

WOOLRIDGE
(to guard)
Melvin go get Karl and take him
down to the old classroom

WOOLRIDGE
Ill talk to him and see what we
can do

INT CLASSROOM - DAY

Woolridge is opening a door He enters and the women follow
him in He flips on a light switch and very bright florescent
lights illuminate the room

WOOLRIDGE
You see Karl growing up only
knew that sex was wrong and that
people who did it should be killed
for it He couldnt really read
but well neither could his
mother But his father made sure
that his mother knew what the Bible
said And she made sure Karl knew
You know he slept in a hole in the
ground under a toolshed right

MARSHA
I knew he slept in a toolshed

WOOLRIDGE
His mother told him that he was
their punishment Hers and his
fathers from God for having sex--

MARSHA
Before they were married

WOOLRIDGE
I dont think so Just period I
think She told him God gave
them the ugliest creation he could
think of Karl has an entire book --
a notebook On every page it says
Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number
1 He wrote that a few years ago
after hed learned to write His
fathers name was Franklin

MARSHA
Thats really strange What does it
mean

WOOLRIDGE

One of his Daddys Bible lessons I
imagine Yall pull up a chair
Ill go out and talk to him

INT REC ROOM
CLOSE UP on Charless face
CHARLES

You have to make something explode

examine the tiny particles while

MELVIN

Melvin and Karl walk down the hallway Woolridge stands
outside the door of the classroom They reach him and
Woolridge talks quietly to Karl

WOOLRIDGE

MARSHA

MARSHA

reevaluated He doesnt show any
signs any more

MARSHA
Signs

WOOLRIDGE
Homicidal signs Oh were gonna

Woolridge turns on a lamp on a desk and turns off the
overhead lights He opens the door and Melvin brings Karl in
In the semidarkness Woolridge pushes a chair up and motions
for Marsha to sit Karl stands beside Melvin motionless
Woolridge whispers to Theresa

WOOLRIDGE (CONTD)
Youll have to step outside

Theresa starts to protest

WOOLRIDGE (CONTD)
Please

Karl sits down in a folding chair near a lamp as Melvin
ushers Theresa outside into the hallway Karl sits staring at
the floor Rubbing his palms together and breathing
strangely as usual He sits silent for what seems like
forever

INT HALLWAY - DAY

Theresa stands on one side of the door Melvin on the other
THERESA
Can I just sneak in there I wont
take any pictures I promise I
just want to listen

MELVIN
No matam Im sorry you cant

Theresa takes a cigarette from her purse and starts to light
it

MELVIN (CONTD)
You cant smoke in here Im sorry

INT CLASSROOM - DAY

Marsha is staring at Karl Karl still breathing and rubbing
his palms starts to speak His voice is low and raspy but
not just low and raspy strange

KARL

Well I reckon what youre a
wanting to know is what Im doing
in here I reckon the reason Im in
here is cause I killed somebody
But I reckon what you was a wanting
to know is how come me to kill
somebody Well I reckon Ill start
at the front and tell you

(pause heavy breathing)
I lived most of my life out behind
my mother and fathers house ina
little old shed and my daddyd
built for me They didnt too much
want me up there in the house with
the rest of em I mostly just set
around out there in the shed all
the time a lookin at the ground
It didnt have no floor but I had
me a hole dug out to lay down in
and a quilt or tow that I put down
there

(pause more breathing)
My daddy was a hard workin man
most of his life not that I can
say the same fer myself I most
just set around the shed and
tinkered around with a lawn mower
or two and went to school off and
on from time to time but the
children there made quite a bit of
sport of me made fun of me quite a
bit Some of em roughed me up
sometimes so mostly I stayed out
back there in the shed My daddy
worked down at the sawmill there
down there at the planer mill for
an old man named Dixon
Old man Dixon was a very cruel
feller he didnt treat his
employees very well didnt pay em
much of a wage didnt pay my daddy
much of a wage just barely enough
to get by on But I reckon he got
by all right they come out one or
the other of em usually my
mother and fed me pretty regular
At least I know he made enough for
me to have mustard and biscuits
three or four times a week Old man
Dixon had a boy named Jesse Dixon
Jesse was really more cruel than
his daddy He made quite a bit of
sport of me and takened advantage
of the little girls around the
neighborhood quite a bit

(pause)
He used to say my mother was a very
pretty woman He said it quite a
bit from time to time when I was
at the school house Well I reckon
you want me to get on and tell you
what happened so I reckon Ill tell
you I was settin out in the shed
one evenin not doin too much
just kindly starin at the wall and
a waitin fer my mother to come out
and give me my Bible lesson and I
heared a commotion up in the house
there so I got up and run up on the
screened-in porch there to see what
was a goin on and I looked in the
kitchen window and I seen my mother
a layin there on the floor without
any clothes on

(pause breathing)
And seen Jesse Dixon a layin on
top of her having his way with her

(pause)
Well I just seen red I picked up
a kaiser blade that was a layin
there by the screen door some
folks calls it a sling blade I
call it a kaiser blade Its just a

long handle like a axe handle with
a long blade on it thats shaped
kind of like a banana Sharp on one
edge and dull on the other Its
what the highway boys use to cut
down weeds and whatnot
I went in the kitchen there and I
hit Jesse Dixon up side the head
with it and knocked him off my
mother I reckon that didnt quite
satisfy me so I hit him again in
the neck with the sharp edge and
just plumb near cut his head off
Killed him Well my mother she
jumped up from there and started
yellin What did you kill Jesse
fer What did you kill Jesse fer

(pause intense breathing)
Well come to find out my mother
didnt really mind what Jesse was a
doin to her I reckon that made me
madder than what Jesse had made me
I takened the kaiser blade some
folks calls it a sling blade I
call it a kaiser blade and hit my
mother up side the head with it an
killed her

(long pause breathing)
Some folks has asked me if I had it
to do over again would I do the
same thing dont know I reckon
I would Anyhow they seen fit to
put me in here and here Ive been
for a great long while Ive
learned to read some took me four
years to read the Bible I reckon I
understand a good deal of it It
wasnt what expected in a lot of
places Ive slept in a good bed
for a great long while Theyve
seen fit to put me out now They
tell me theyre a settin me free
today Anyhow I reckon thats all
you need to know If you want any
more details I reckon I can tell
em to you dont know if thats
enough for your newspaper or not

Suddenly Marsha speaks from the darkness

MARSHA
Will you ever kill anybody again
Karl

This seems to startle the very room itself Woolridge motions
for Marsha to shut up and Karl stops still Very still He
breathes hard for a moment then starts to calm down He seems
almost at ease He slowly looks up From Karls point of view
we barely see Marshas face in the dim light Karl is looking
straight at Marsha

KARL
(slowly)
I dont reckon I got no reason to
kill nobody

INT HALLWAY - DAY

Woolridge stands just outside the classroom door with Marsha
and Theresa Karl stands down the way a few feet with Melvin

MARSHA
Is he leaving right this minute

WOOLRIDGE

parking lot

MARSHA

Marsha and Theresa walk toward the exit As they pass Karl he
speaks to Marsha

EXT WOODED AREA - LATE AFTERNOON

Karl and Frank sit on stumps in a little clearing enjoying
the spoils of their Bens Dollar Store visit

FRANK
This is what I call my secret place
cause I come out here when I feel
like bein by myself I used to
come here with Karen Cross Shes
kind of like my girlfriend or used
to be She says she likes Jerry
Maroney now But Im gonna get her
back cause I love her We used to
come here and hold hands and talk
and read books to each other with a
flashlight She didnt want to have
anything to do with me in front of
other people cause I dont have
any money Well mama and me I
mean She seemed to like me a whole
lot when we were out here though
She said she loved me too Out
here Settin right on that stump
youre on See her daddys a
dentist so theyre rich Sos Jerry
Maroneys daddy He owns the ice
plant Was your folks well off

KARL
Naw Didnt have too much Enough
to scrape by on I reckon

FRANK
They still around your folks

KARL
My mothers dead My daddys
sposed to be around still He
dont want to have nothin to do
with me though

FRANK
How do you know

KARL
He never did want to I figure he
aint changed his mind much

FRANK
How did your mama die

KARL

(long pause)
You dont need to know all of that
Youre just a boy
You need to think about good
thoughts while youre still a boy
Theyll be plenty of time for the
other

FRANK

Ive had a lot of bad thoughts
since my daddy died Sometimes I
wish I was still real little and he
was still here My mamas real
good but I wish I had both of em

(pause)
When we went to Memphis one time in
the car it was rainin so hard we
couldnt see the road But I wadnt
scared because I thought as long as
daddy was drivin nothin could
happen to us I feel that way about
mama now

(he looks at the ground

for a moment)
Mama has a boyfriend now His name
is Doyle Hargraves He works
construction so he makes a pretty
good livin He still dont help
mama out with any money though He
aint no good Hes mean to her He
dont like me at all Mama says
its because hes jealous I belong
to my daddy instead of him He
stays with us all night sometimes
but hes got his own house
Somebody told me its so he can
still have other girlfriends I
like it on the nights when he aint
at our house Im not so nervous
then

KARL
How come her to keep bein
girlfriends and all with him if
hes mean to her

FRANK

She says its for the times when
hes good to her Shes lonely
since daddy died She said
sometimes she dont know why
(pause)

He threatened to kill her if she
ever left him My daddy would kill
him if he was here and somebody was
mean to mama Vaughan hes real
good to mama Vaughan that you met
But hes not able to do anything to
Doyle hes funny you know Not
funny ha ha funny queer He likes
to go with men instead of women
That makes him not to be able to
fight too good He sure is nice
though Hes from St Louis People
who are queer can get along better
in a big town He got transferred
here to work But mama said the
real reason he left is cause his
daddy hated him For bein the way
he is I wish he liked to go with
women Id rather him be mamas
boyfriend than Doyle

Pause as Frank looks at the ground again He seems troubled

FRANK (CONTD)
Karl
(pause)
You know when I said daddy got hit
by a train

KARL
Yeah I remember you a-tellin me
that

FRANK

It aint the truth He shot hisself
with a shotgun on purpose
KARL
Why did he do that reckon

FRANK

Cause he didnt have enough money
to take care of us the way he
wanted to Thats what the letter
said He got laid off from work and
had to just work odd jobs I
thought he took care of us fine

(pause)
Karl did you really kill somebody

KARL
Yeah I did

FRANK
Who did you kill

KARL
Two people

FRANK
Were they bad people

KARL
I thought they was

FRANK
Maybe they needed it

KARL
I growed up and got taught it aint
right to kill nobody

FRANK
Its okay if youre lookin out for
yourself If its self-defense Was
it self-defense

Karl shifts around and makes a noise in his throat and
doesnt answer

FRANK (CONTD)
My daddy was good I think too many
good people die It aint right

DISSOLVE TO
INT HAMBURGER ESTABLISHMENT - DAY

Vaughan is carrying a tray of food as Karl follows him to a
table and they sit and immediately start to eat After a few
bites Vaughan starts to speak in an official manner

VAUGHAN
Okay Karl the reason I brought
you here was to talk to you about
something that is on my mind
(pauses for a response
instead Karl eats french
fries and stares at the
table)
I guess Ill put it right out on
the table Where do I start Linda
and Frank are very important to me
Theyre like family My own family
was never like family Theyre
horrible people As a matter of
fact I prayed every night for years
that my father would die I finally
realized through a lot of therapy
that I was wasting my energy on
hating him Now I just dont care

(pause)
You see you and I are a lot alike
strange as that may seem I mean
not physically or even mentally
really just well maybe
emotionally or actually the hand
weve been dealt in life Were
different People see us as being
different anyway Youre -- well
you have your affliction or
whatever and I well mines not as
easy to see Im just going to say
it Im gay

(watts)
Does that surprise you

(watts)
That Im gay You know what being
gay is dont you

KARL
I reckon not

VAUGHAN
Homosexual I like men Sexually

KARL
Not funny ha ha funny queer

VAUGHAN
Well thats a very offensive way to
put it You shouldnt say that You
were taught that werent you

KARL
Ive heard it said that way

VAUGHAN
Anyway its hard to live gay
thats the right way to say it in
a small town like this Ive wanted
to leave many times but my love
for Linda and Frank and another
certain person that we wont go
into have kept me from it Anyway
Im rambling If youre going to
live in the Wheatly garage you need
to know that it wont be easy
Doyle is a monster Not just a
closed minded redneck but a
monster A dangerous person Ive
told Linda that one day that man is
going to really hurt her or that
boy Maybe even kill one of them I
see it in his eyes Im very in
tune maybe even psychic Doyle
will make your life hell Youre a
perfect target When I first saw
you I was afraid of you Not really
afraid I guess just taken aback
But also I felt a real sensitive
feeling from you And for some
reason Frank has adopted you Much
like a stray animal Im sorry I
didnt mean it like that In a good
way Anyway I just want you to
know what youre in for I have a
good feeling about you Youre good
for Frank Maybe its that he can
have an adult friend on a childs
level
Im sorry I didnt mean it ina
bad way

(pause)
Theres one more thing Its none
of my business why you were in the
state hospital Everyone has
something in their past maybe you
tried suicide maybe you did
something -- terrible But what I
see before me is a gentle simple
man All I want you to promise me
is that youre capable of being
around Linda and Frank You know
You would never hurt them under any
circumstances would you

KARL
I wouldnt never hurt them

VAUGHAN
Thats what I thought I hope I
havent offended you in any way
You seem like a thinker You seem
to always be in deep thought Tell
me something What are you thinking
right now
Karl looks up and stares for a moment

KARL
I was thinkin I could use me
another helpin of these potaters

VAUGHAN
Oh How about before that

KARL
Before that I was thinkin itd be
good if I could get another three
or four cans of that potted meat if
you got any extry

INT DOYLES TRUCK - NIGHT

Doyle is driving Vaughan in the middle and Karl by the
window Doyle cranks up the truck and pops in a cassette
tape The first few notes of Ghost Riders in the Sky play

VAUGHAN
Are you sure you can drive Youve
really had a lot of alcohol

DOYLE
Shhhh This is the national anthem

They take off tires screaming on the pavement as the song
goes louder

EXT STREET - NIGHT

The truck fishtails into the night and we see the rest of the
band in the back of the truck trying to control Terences
wheelchair as it rolls back and forth

INT TRUCK - NIGHT

DOYLE
(points to tape player)
Not that you afflicted sons of
bitches would know anything about
it but this is art

They are stopped by a red traffic light A police car pulls
up beside them and Doyle looks over at the RED-FACED COP on
the passenger side and turns down the music

DOYLE (CONTD)
Hey Freddy whats goin on boy I
seen your pitcher in the paper for
catchin that big-ass bass

FREDDY
Yeah She was a big un You aint

DOYLE

FREDDY
(laughing)

Doyle peels out and the music blares again

DOYLE (CONTD)

men in a dual wheel truck dont
you

VAUGHAN
Oh yeah Im thrilled

DOYLE
Sarcastic right
(pause)
You know the boys in the band are
probably gonna stay over tonight
Wed be glad to have you

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Doyle slouches in his chair drinking whiskey from the bottle
Terence and Morris are sitting facing Karl and Vaughan who
are on the sofa Randy and The Johnson are sitting across the
room in straight-backed chairs drinking beer They really
stocked up at the county line and beer and liquor bottles are
strewn everywhere Morris is in the middle of a monologue
which has obviously been going on for awhile

MORRIS
Anyhow Im not sure if you follow
me on those particular points but
its not really important in the
smaller picture which is where
most people dwell anyway Not that
being manager of Bens Dollar Store
is insignificant Or that making it
through years of incarceration in a
state supported facility is any
small feat
THE JOHNSON
Morris hes the only one in the
band that went to college

RANDY
Im in junior college right now
over in Westfield

THE JOHNSON
That aint no college thats trade
school Auto repair aint ever made
a genius out of nobody

MORRIS
Holidays are for campers

RANDY
What do you know about bein a
genius Johnson You cant even
hardly keep a steady beat on that
high-price drum set

TERENCE
I think yall play really tight
together Randy Yall shouldnt
throw off on one another

MORRIS
Anything that has to be discussed
cant mean anything

DOYLE
You got that shit right

VAUGHAN
What exactly do you mean by that I
dont understand

MORRIS
Exactly the point my young
levelheaded friend

VAUGHAN
I dont get it

MORRIS
I rest my case

TERENCE
Morris is real smart with
philosophies and things Thats why
him and me are the songwriting team
of our group I make up good tunes
or melodies as we call them and
Morris is the lyrics

MORRIS
Not unlike Gary Brooker of the
Protocol Harum

RANDY
We dont ever play any songs that
yall wrote I never even heard one
of em Yall just talk

THE JOHNSON
We dont even play any songs with
words at all that I remember We
aint got no fuckin microphone Or
speaker set up

TERENCE
We wrote one last night standin
outside Mini-Mart Morris called it
Stuart Drives a Comfortable Car
Then you know like on country
songs in parenthesis it says There
is usually someone in the trunk I
came up with a tune just humming

DOYLE
See Vaughan you shouldnt question
a genius Morris is a modern day
poet like in the old days

MORRIS
Our latest composition is as
follows entitled
The Thrill --
I stand on the hill
Not for a thrill
but for a breath
of a fresh kill
Never mind the man
who contemplates
doing away with license plates
He stands alone anyway
Baking the cookies of discontent
By the heat of a laundrymat vent
Leaving his soul
(Then like in poetry I have dot dot
dot then drop down to the next line
kind of off center)
Leaving his soul parting waters
Under the medulla oblongata

of (then dot dot dot again)
mankind

Silence for a moment as everyone in the room just stares at
something other than Morris

TERENCE

I dont think thats right I
believe dot dot dot come between
medulla and oblongata or something
like that

(Morris stares at him)
Well it did It wadnt before
mankind I know that much

MORRIS
The dots are where I say they are
Melody and tune Thats your trade
Youre a tunesmith Terence

VAUGHAN
dont really understand the
meaning of the words

DOYLE
£ yall dont shut up Im gonna go
out of my mind And plus youre
liable to bust a spring in Karls
head Hes already off balance

TERENCE
That wadnt the way you made it up
before Morris Thats all I know

RANDY
We dont need fancy words we need
to practice We dont ever
rehearse

THE JOHNSON
We need some payin gigs instead of
just messin around on first one
patio and then anothern

RANDY
Morris you should just be the
manager you cant play nothin
anyway

Doyle jumps up and throws his whiskey bottle through the
window He has changed from groggy drunk to a wild-eyed
madman ina flash

DOYLE
We dont have a goddamn band Yall
just shut the fuck up We dont
need no practicin or managers
cause we aint no fuckin band
Morris aint no genius and the rest
of you are just losers Am I the
only one sane human bein around
here Just get the hell out of my
house and dont come back

VAUGHAN
Its not your house Doyle its
Lindas

DOYLE

Tll kill you you fuckin faggot
You mind your own business Now get
out Now before I get too mad to
turn back

TERENCE
What about our instruments

Doyle grabs the handles of Terences wheelchair and pushes
him right out the screen door We hear the chair clatter down
the steps and a cry of pain from Terence

DOYLE
Now

They all file out the door except Vaughan and Karl who sit
frozen on the sofa

THE JOHNSON
(turning back)
You aint right Doyle Somethins
wrong with you Nobody needs your
shit

MORRIS
(stops at the door)
The dots just look good on paper
You dont sing em anyway Youre
showing your true Aries colors now

DOYLE
Get out of my goddamn face you
fuckin buzzard
He slams the door and turns to see Vaughan and Karl on the
sofa and Linda and Frank in their nightclothes standing in
the doorway

DOYLE (CONTD)
I thought I told everybody to get
out of my house That includes
cocksuckers and retards Get off
your asses and go

LINDA
This is not your house Doyle This
is my house and Ill say who stays
and goes Youve got a house why

girlfriends and go home to it

DOYLE

VAUGHAN
Doyle dont you lay one hand on
her

DOYLE

Linda walks up to him with Frank close behind Vaughan gets
up also Karl stares at the floor rubbing his hands together

LINDA

DOYLE

She shoves him in the chest and he slaps her hard in the
face Vaughan starts looking for a weapon and Frank goes
wild He starts throwing anything he can find at Doyle Empty
cans bottles a lampstand

He connects with an encyclopedia to the head Doyle goes to
the door His face has changed from angry to sad almost
pitiful

DOYLE (CONTD)
Okay Ill leave and sober up

FRANK

ALBERT the friend Linda
MELINDA the Dollar-Store girl

Frank Karl

picks at hers and the others are engaged in idle chit chat

This goes on for a few moments

to Karl

ALBERT
So Karl do you intend to stay in
the lawnmower business for a while
or do you have other plans

KARL
I reckon

VAUGHAN
I think Karl is going to be a
writer or a librarian eventually
You should see all the books he
has He must read constantly

KARL
I aint read em yet except two or
three of em I cant understand a
lot of what I try to read My mind
hit wonders off to somethin else
when I try to read

ALBERT
Im the same way Of course in my
line of work I stay too busy to
read
But at least I have job security
People may stop doing a lot of
things but one thing is for sure
they wont stop dying

LINDA
(looks at Frank)
Why dont we talk about something a
little more festive

VAUGHAN

mama So I switched over to
thinkin about his mama and then
what he told me would happen

FRANK
I kind of like you tellin me what

daddy I didnt mind him tellin

get away from him is for him to get
away from us That we cant leave
him or hell try and hurt her

KARL
He aint no count

FRANK
And then some people you dont like
right off Its funny
(pause)
You know why I want you to play
ball with me

KARL
Naw

FRANK
Cause its fun It dont matter if
you aint no good It takes your
mind off of everything else while
youre doin it When you run real
fast tryin to make a touchdown you
dont think about anything else I
aint no good but my daddy always
said he was proud of me when I
threw a ball or ran with it Did
you have any brothers and sisters
growin up to play with

KARL
I had one there for little bit Hit
didnt get old enough to play with

FRANK
Why not It died

KARL
Yeah

FRANK
Why

KARL

Hit was borned a little too early
on My mother and father made hit
come too early some way or other I
reckon they changed their mind
about havin anothern I was about
six or eight year old then and they
didnt care too much for me so I
reckon they didnt need somethin
else to worry ‘em with

FRANK
So it died when it come out

KARL
My daddy come to the shed out back
and got me and said throw this here
away and handed me a towel with
somethin in it I went for the
trash barrel there and opened up
the towel to see cause they was a
noise and somethin movin in it
Hit was bloody-like around that
towel Hit was a little ol bitty
baby no bigger than a squirrel

FRANK
It was alive

KARL
Yes sir Right then it was

FRANK
A boy or girl

KARL
A little ol boy

FRANK
You threw it in a trash barrel

KARL
I didnt feel right about doin
that I takened a shoe box from
there in the shed and emptied out
some screwdrivers and nuts and
warshers from it and put the little
feller in that and buried him in
the corner of the yard there That
seemed more proper to me I reckon

FRANK
t was still alive when you buried
it

KARL
heared it cryin a little through
that box

FRANK
That dont seem right It seems
like you should have kept him alive
and took care of him if he was your
brother

KARL
I wadnt but six or eight I reckon
I didnt know what to do I didnt
know how to care for no baby Mama
and Daddy didnt want him They
learned me to do what they told me
to These days I figure it might of
been best to give him right back to
the Good Lord right off the bat
anyhow

FRANK
That makes me feel real sad
Couldnt you have done somethin
arl I would have I wish I would
of had him Hed be here right now
Livin

KARL

Hits been hard thinkin about it
They aint a day goes by I dont
think about it I kindly have a
picture of it up in my head that I
see Hit makes me sad too I have
bad thoughts on it I wished they
was somethin I could of did too
Shouldnt no bad things happen to
childern All the ol bad things
ort to be saved up for folks thats
growed up the way I see it I
shouldnt of told you about that A
boy ort not hear about such things
It just kindly come out

FRANK

I didnt mean to say anything bad
about you I know youre good You
didnt mean no harm

(pause)
Did you ever think about killin
yourself on purpose like my daddy
did

KARL
Ive studied about it The Bible
says not to or you end up goin to
Hades Some folks calls it Hell I
call it Hades

FRANK
Bible says the same thing about
killin others too

KARL
Yes sir I reckon it does

ball just as Karl bites the dirt Frank goes into the end
