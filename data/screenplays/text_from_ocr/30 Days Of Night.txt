EXT ALASKAN COAST - DUSK - PRE-TITLES 1

TITLE TWO DAYS AGO Snowstorm A single man in a rowboat --
the STRANGER -- forges through the icy waters toward the

coast It’s hard to say how old he is -- 20s 40s -- because
he’s so filthy and red-eyed and yet so fiercely driven

In shadows behind him stands the eerie forbidding SHIP which
brought him this far Hitting the edge of the ice the
Stranger clambers out of his boat and trudges inland smiling
thinly as he sees the boat drift away no use to him anymore --

TITLES ROLL as we follow the Stranger through the wide eerie
twilight of the Alaskan wilderness -- blasted by the wind yet
persevering too yearning and wild-eyed to slow down --

As he crests a small ridge of ice we see a clutch of lights
shimmering in the distance BARROW ALASKA An Arctic outpost
of a town an oil and mining outpost ringed with derricks and
tundra The Stranger grins as he sees Barrow twinkling
through the snowstorm and presses onward AS TITLES END --

EXT SLOPE - SUNDOWN 2

TITLE TONIGHT A MAN stands back to the setting sun his
face cloaked in shadows -- until he turns thoughtfully the
light gradually revealing a weathered and soulful gaze He is
SHERIFF EBEN OLESON early 30s --

EBEN
Strange

He faces BILLY KITKA earnest 40s wearing a deputy’s badge
and shining a flashlight into a snowbank west of Barrow --

BILLY
Ain’t it Who’d do a thing like this

THEIR POV a smoldering eerie hole in the snow -- filled with
BURNED CELL AND SATELLITE PHONES --

Eben kneels down to examine the firepit baffled --

BILLY (cont’d)
Someone got a little upset about
roaming charges

EBEN
Stealing satellite phones’d make
sense you could hock them maybe run
up charges on someone’s account But
burning them

BILLY
Kids Pulling some prank

EBEN
There’d be a message “Fuck you” to
their parents or the world or whoever

Eben walks up toward the summit thoughtfully --

EBEN (cont’d)
Best place to solve this is the Diner
Billy Get people talking they’1l
gossip and figure it out for us

Billy watches as Eben keeps hiking toward the crest --
EXT SUMMIT - SUNDOWN 3

The last golden arc of the sun gleams silhouetting Eben as
Billy comes to join him

BILLY
I remember I brought Peggy here on our
first date

EBEN
We all did Not Peggy I mean just --

BILLY
(light chuckle)
I gotcha C’mon let’s do the sign --
(studying his friend)
You okay

Eben stares out at the sun quietly wistfully --

EBEN
Yeah I only --
(a beat)
Last sunset for a month some years
it’s easier to take y’know

Eben turns not ready to say more and Billy knows better than
to ask Shoving his feelings down deep Eben hikes back
toward the 4x4 waiting at the bottom of the slope --

OMITTED 3A
EXT BARROW CITY LIMITS - DUSK 4
The sun’s down but light filters through approaching night

The 4x4 comes to a stop beside a bright good-natured sign
from a Tourism Bureau with a sense of humor
5A

“WELCOME TO BARROW ALASKA -- TOP OF THE WORLD POPULATION
563 -- WARNING DANGER POLAR BEARS”

Billy jumps from the 4x4 to the “WELCOME TO BARROW” sign
pulling out some metal tags Eben calls from the car --

EBEN
Nobody’s gonna see that sign for the
next thirty days --

BILLY
It’s a tradition

Billy hangs the tags “152” over the “563” changing the
population for the winter OVER THIS THE SOUND OF DOGS
BARKING FIERCELY --

EXT RIIS HOME - DUSK 5
Elongating shadows from the fleeting amber daylight The
residential side of Barrow Homes are built on stilts to
avoid the stresses of ice and critters in their foundations
All the homes have crawlspaces underneath of varying sizes

FOUR HUSKIES ARE BARKING from behind the fence of the RIIS
residence -- sled dogs deeply unhappy about something --

A SHADOW passes across the screen -- the dogs follow the

shadow angrily -- until suddenly there is a GLEAMING FLASH AND

HISS OF A BLADE -- the SICKENING SLICE OF A KNIFE INTO FLESH
and the barks are replaced by horrifying WHINES OF PAIN

EXT BARROW CITY LIMITSEBEN’S 4X4 - DUSK 5A

At the edge of town Eben and Billy pull over beside a HUGE
SNOWPLOW swerved crookedly onto the shoulder The back is
covered with a tarp a stream of oil drips from the truckbed
Working under the open hood is BEAU BROWER late 50s thick-
bearded an ox of a man with the social skills to match

EBEN
Little problem

BEAU
(not a glance up)
Nothin’ I can’t handle my own fuckin’
self

Eben gets out of his 4x4 circles the vehicle pulls a leaking

GAS CAN from under the tarp

EBEN
This for generators

BEAU
Mostly

EBEN
I can’t have it leaking all over the
roads Beau I’1l have to cite you

He pulls out a citation book scribbles away as Beau rants --

BEAU

HAVETA do anything That’s why we
live up here innit So we gotta

that cute wifey of his One of us

Eben rips a ticket blithely tucks it in Beau’s parka --

EBEN
Happy motoring

BEAU
I‘1l add this to my collection

Eben climbs back in the 4x4 and starts the engine --

BILLY
Beau’s not so bad Why do you bother
writing him up

EBEN
He lives all by himself in that cabin
on the south ridge y’know A little
citation now and then reminds Beau
he’s part of this town

BILLY
He’s right though --

EBEN
About what

BILLY
You should drop me at home The wife

Dark --

Eben gently smirks as the WALKIE-TALKIE BLARES with the VOICE
of his elderly dispatcher HELEN --

checks forms on her clipboard closes it heads for her 4x4 --

STELLA

She starts up her engine as Adam sighs -- shame to see a woman
like this alone --

EXTINT BARROW CITY LIMITSSTELLA’S 4X4 - DUSK 6C

Stella’s driving hellbent for the airport Coming from the
left at a desolate intersection is a large DITCH DRILLER -- an
enormous RUMBLING truck with treads instead of tires and a
maneuverable ROARING CHAINSAW mounted on its nose The ditch
driller SHOULD stop at a STOP SIGN --

But to Stella’s shock the ditch driller DOESN’T stop
imbedding its chainsaw in one of Stella’s FRONT TIRES and
fishtailing Stella’s 4x4 to a full stop --

Stella emerges from her 4x4 livid --

STELLA
Goddamn it Malekai Don’t you know
what a stop sign means

Climbing out of the cab is MALEKAI HAMM 20 abashed --

MALEKAT
I’m sorry Stella the brakes jammed --

Mute with anger Stella inspects both her own useless vehicle
and the ditch driller --

MALEKAI (contd)
Eben wanted this back from the airport
before the storm hits I was just
trying to --

Stella doesn’t have time for Malekai’s sputtering guilt she
pops the trunk on her 4x4 and pulls out her carryon bag
looking at the snowy isolated expanse around them --

STELLA

Who’s gonna run me to the airport
ADAM

Wouldn’t Eben --

Stella sighs deeply of course Eben would but --
STELLA
I just popped into town for work I
didn’t want things to get messy --
MALEKAT
My mom could bring the towtruck -- but
yknow she doesn’t move so fast --

STELLA
Thanks Malekai --

For nothing Stella gives up and pulls out her cellphone --

Stella anxious next to a sheepish Malekai not looking
forward to this call --

STELLA
Surprise I need a ride to the
airport
EBEN
Wait -- what You’re in town --

STELLA

355 gotta get back to Anchorage
before the airport closes You want
to talk we can do it on the drive --

EXT STREETSEBEN’S 4X4 - DUSK - RESUME 7B

Maybe Eben doesn’t want to talk if this is how she’s gonna be
He covers the cellphone checks his watch Opening his door
he YELLS DOWN THE STREET to the departing Billy --

EBEN
HEY BILLY Stella’s at Ransom and
355 can you get her to a plane

Billy signals thumbs up hikes off quickly as Eben calmly
gets back on the cell --

EBEN (cont’d)

Stella glances at the damaged car again decides to take a
look at the ditch driller while Malekai haplessly loads all
his junk out of the vehicle She kneels by the tires
inspects the brakes -- and frowns --

BILLY (0S)
Your limo’s here Ms Oleson --

Stella jumps up thankfully grabs her carryon and boards
Billy’s 4x4 as they talk --

STELLA

Just drive okay

EXT PIPELINE - NIGHT TE

Three oil workers 20s wobble past the PIPELINE AARON (with
half-empty Jack Daniels) and GABE eye DENISE hopefully while

They all laugh none of them sure where this might be heading

but willing to see -- as Eben pulls up beside them

EBEN
Hey Aaron -- you know there’s no
drinking till the sun’s back up

They shift embarrassed to be busted as Gabe takes the bottle

from Aaron and hands it to Eben --

GABE

drunk on Denise’s beauty and charm

DENISE
(laughing)

This wasn’t done long enough ago that

INT SHERIFF’S STATION - NIGHT 15

JAKE 15 plays Risk against himself moving from one side of
the board to the other Bright pale he’s like the love
child of David Byrne and Elvis Costello As he plays --

JAKE
Itd be easier if you played Helen --

Across the room HELEN late 60s sits at the radio console
She doesn’t like you to know that she’s fighting cancer a
positive attitude is one of her weapons against it

HELEN
I don’t really care for games like
that if you want to know the truth
Don’t you learn a lot when you play
against yourself

JAKE
Yeah yeah yeah Playing yourself is
the ultimate blahdy-blah-blah --

Helen nods toward the entering Eben laboriously sheds his
winter gear --

HELEN
Try your brother

Eben appraises the gameboard as he takes a blast from an
albuterol INHALER -- something he only does among family --

EBEN
“The Classic Game of Global
Domination” I’m a little jammed
today --

Helen hands Eben some reports --
HELEN
While you were busy with John Riis
Carter and Wilson called about a
vandalism problem at the Utilidor --

Eben sighs laboriously puts everything back on --

EBEN
Damn What the hell’s goin’ on

He heads out with a nod to Jake instructions for Helen --

EBEN (cont’d)
Call Point Hope and Wainwright see if
they’re having any troubles --

EXT UTILIDOR - NIGHT 16

THE UTILIDOR SEWAGE PLANT sits on the edge of town a PUMP
HOUSE and TWO TOWERING STORAGE TANKS From the pump house
comes CARTER DAVIES 50s Santa Claus build in a Tourism
Bureau T-shirt depicting a license plate reading “ALASKA
B4UDIE” He calls to the burly JAYKO TWINS PAUL AND XAVIER
(both 36) cleaning a large SEWAGE PIPE some distance away --

CARTER
Guys you can’t get that pipe fixed
tonight Seal it off from the town
and come back tomorrow --

The twins nod and seal off the pipe Eben walks from his 4x4 --
EBEN

WILSON BULOSAN joins Carter in the doorway his down vest
reading “POLAR TOURS” Filipino early 30s normally

gregarious but now troubled he gestures inside --

WILSON
You need to see this Eben --

INT PUMP HOUSE UTILIDOR - NIGHT 17

Eben follows Carter and Wilson through the pump house where
Carter monitors the sewage system His control panel is
adorned with knickknacks and photos especially a PHOTO of
Carter with his WIFE AND FOUR KIDS Eben examines it --

EBEN
Can’t your wife send you a sweater or
two And bring the whole tribe back
here while she’s at it

CARTER
(shrugs diffidently)
They’1l come when they’re ready I
guess --

EBEN
(gentle advice)
A family oughta be together Carter --

Carter nods in quiet resignation acknowledging his friend but
changing the subject --

CARTER
So I’ve found all kindsa garbage here
over the years Blue jeans bikes
Sometimes I can yank ‘em out before
the Muffin Monster chews ‘em to shit --

WILSON
The Muffin Monster

CARTER
My little nickname for it --

OMITTED 18
INT MUFFIN MONSTER - NIGHT 19

Eben Carter and Wilson stand before a HIGH-TORQUE FOUR-SHAFT
SHREDDER a device that can literally turn steel drums into
confetti This is the Muffin Monster where all the pipes
lead disposing of Barrow’s garbage and sewage The razor-
edged shafts spin steadily Carter pulls up a trashcan --

CARTER
Saw Wilson’s logo pulled this stuff
out before it got totally shredded --

Wilson angrily shows Eben a pile of chewed-up debris -- seat
belts fragments of passenger seats dashboard controls -- a
couple of which bear the “POLAR TOURS” logo --

EBEN
You keep your copter under lock and
key don’t you Wilson

WILSON
Yep I put it in drydock when the
tourists headed south Haven’t looked
at it for days

EBEN
(examines the damage)
Could you fix it up if you needed to

WILSON
Not without parts from Anchorage
This is my living Eben Why would
someone rip the hell out of my bird

Wilson takes some of the debris and angrily tosses it into the
Muffin Monster -- which chews it all up with STARTLING SPEED

EXT DISH TOWER - NIGHT 20
An impressive SATELLITE DISH TOWER at the north end of town
Bristling with ANTENNAE AND CELL RECEIVERS The product of
big time oil money The Trans-Alaska PIPELINE runs past the
base of the tower beyond the barbed fence --

It’s starting to SNOW the white flecks swirling about in the
darkness TRACK THROUGH THE SNOW AROUND THE TOWER --

A DEAD-WHITE FACE FLASHES IN THE STORM -- and is gone before
we can be sure we saw it at all --

INT DISH TOWER - NIGHT 21

GUS LAMBERT late 60s portly sits at a control panel
WHISTLES an old swing band tune to himself --

SOMEWHERE OUTSIDE -- WE HEAR A DISTANT ETHEREAL HOWL ARCING
UP THE TOP OF THE SCALE --

Gus stops he’s never heard anything like that before Still
he’d ignore it until THERE’S AN ELECTRONIC SIZZLE -- HALF THE
DIALS ON THE CONTROL PANEL BLINK OUT Gus grabs his parka
buttons up and heads for the door --

EXT DISH TOWER - NIGHT 22

Snow falls Gus opens the door walks out into the dark
shivering as his breath clouds around him Behind him THE
CRUNCH OF A FOOTFALL IN SNOW He whirls shining his
flashlight everywhere in the eerie silence but sees nothing --

Gus pushes forward into the darkness as a SHAPE FLASHES
BEHIND HIM unseen by us -- he spins again as there’s ANOTHER
CRUNCH in the snow He exploring for the source of the sound
but there’s still nothing He’s tensing realizing he doesn’t
want to be out here heading back for the building --

When he comes across several lines of FOOTPRINTS crossing the
path back to the dish tower --

Quivering now following the footprints with his flashlight
Gus comes across a pair of GLEAMING BLACK EYES sizing him up
in the darkness --

Then they’re gone He sweeps the beam urgently like a
searchlight -- when a SHADOW CROSSES THE BEAM -- MUCH CLOSER
TO HIM THIS TIME -- AND THEN IT’S GONE

Gus works to catch his breath -- what the hell is going on
here Then from right over his shoulder A LOW GUTTERAL
CHUCKLE HARSH AND HUNGRY --

Gus drops the flashlight and the beam shines into his
terrified face He’s surrounded by a GROUP OF SHADOWS
figures that loom menacingly toward him --

GUS
Who -- who are you people --

WHOOOOM -- A SHADOW RIPS A TALONED HAND ACROSS GUS’ NECK --

Blood arcs through the darkness as Gus staggers backward --
and ONE OF THE SHADOWS LUNGES AT GUS THERE IS A COARSE
SAWING SOUND as Gus’s head is wrenched back and forth the
creature SAWING ITS WAY THROUGH GUS’S NECK as they fall -- and
then we hear Gus’s neck SNAP as they hit the ice and he is
rendered nothing but prey --

OMITTED 23
EXT IKOS DINER - NIGHT 24
A little neon oasis in the snowfall --

STRANGER (0S)
(WHISPERS )
No whiskey No rum

INT IKOS DINER - NIGHT 25

LUCY IKOS sturdy late 60s stares uncertainly at the tense
Stranger sitting at her diner counter The Stranger WILL ONLY
EVER SPEAK IN A SIBILANT SLIMY WHISPER --

LUCY
Alcohol’s illegal this month -- folks
have a hard enough time in the dark
without booze making it worse --

STRANGER
Forget the liquor Lucy Bring me a
bowl of raw hamburger

LUCY
You can only get meat two ways around
here -- frozen and burnt

STRANGER
You don’t give me what I want to eat
What I want to drink

He runs a nail across her cheek threateningly Eben claps a
hand on the Stranger’s shoulder --

EBEN
That’s enough pal Leave the woman
be time to hit the road

The Stranger rises out to intimidate -- he’s a bit taller
than Eben but Eben stands his ground without a flinch --

STRANGER
What’s wrong with a man wanting a
little fresh meat

EBEN
If you refuse to leave I’1ll escort
you out of here myself

STRANGER
(looms over Eben)
I‘d like to see that

A GUN BARREL presses against the back of the Stranger’s head
STELLA IS HERE with Billy behind her as she pulls back the
hammer on her weapon --

STELLA
I would too -- but then Lucy’d have to
clean up after Eben kicked your ass
it’s more trouble than you’re worth

As Eben takes out cuffs for the Stranger he takes in Stella’s
presence -- too cool to react but his energy noticeably
different as he looks to Stella’s gun with a raised eyebrow --

EBEN
Fire marshal’s office lets you carry
that

Stella’s also different being around Eben but she knows the
best defense is a good offense --

STELLA
Funny thing I never asked them

Eben grins to himself as he cuffs the Stranger it’s clear he
respects how tough Stella is He looks to Billy --

EBEN
My deputy could’ve helped me here --

BILLY
(an affable shrug)
Yeah but well Eben it’s Stella

Eben nods Billy has a point He tries to keep things
diplomatic with Stella --

EBEN
Missed your plane That sucks Where
are you gonna stay

STELLA
Billy and Peggy are putting me up

EBEN
(that sucks too)
Well Talk to you sometime I guess

It’s awkward and luckily for Eben he’s got work to do But
Stella shoots a look at Billy that maybe she’1ll leave him
here then looks to Eben as he leads the cuffed Stranger out --

STELLA
Maybe I’11 come along -- say hi to
Jake and Helen --

Eben’s got mixed feelings about it can’t figure out a reason
to say yes can’t figure out a reason to say no --

25A INT EBEN’S 4X4 - NIGHT 25A

Eben drives while Stella rides shotgun with the Stranger
cuffed and seething in the back They are silent for several
moments neither of them ready for small talk Finally --

EBEN
-- suddenly there’s more vandalism
here than in the last three years --

Silence Finally --

STELLA
Don’t you know how to take care of
this town without me

It’s one of those jokes that hit so wrong Eben’s answer could
take a day and a half Finally Stella gets to why she really
came along --

STELLA (cont’d)
Look I didn’t want to mention it in
public but I think somebody screwed
with the brakes on the ditch driller --

Silence Finally --

EBEN
Hell of a day

STRANGER
Just wait

Eben silences the Stranger with a glare shoots a glance to
Stella let’s not talk now for God’s sake

INT SHERIFFS STATION - NIGHT 26

CELL BARS SLAM in the Stranger’s face as Eben locks him up and
questions him Jake watching warily in the bg

EBEN
You don’t work at the refinery You’d
have been seen flying in When’d you
get here
(off his silence)
Weve got all night --

The Stranger smirks raising an eyebrow do they Suddenly
Helen bangs at her monitor --

HELEN
Oh criminy Computer’s down

EBEN
I’1l1 call Gus --
(lifting the phone)
Phone’s dead too

Eben SLAMS the receiver down in frustration as the Stranger
WHISPERS WITH A SMIRK --

STRANGER
Mr and Mrs Sheriff So sweet So
helpless against what’s coming

Jake pulls into a corner freaked out Stella reassures him --

STELLA
He’s just trying to get our blood up

JAKE
It’s working

EBEN
Weve got better things to worry
about I’11 check on Gus

STRANGER
Check on Gus Board the windows Try
to hide They’re coming and this time
they’1l take me with them honor me
for all I’ve done --

EBEN
Who are “they”

The Stranger stares steadily at Eben not giving an inch
Jake tries to focus on his game BEHIND HIM THROUGH THE
WINDOW A DEAD-WHITE FACE APPEARS FOR A FLASH THEN IT’S
GONE just as Jake turns sensing it --

LIGHTS BLACK OUT -- throwing the room into darkness The
Stranger WHISPERS again surer and surer of himself --

STRANGER
Board the windows -- try to hide --

But before Helen can intercede Eben lifts up a flashlight and
shines it on a plastic bag filled with pot He’s baffled --

EBEN
What the hell is this

JAKE
(off Helen)
Pot It helps with her cancer She’s
got a little greenhouse at home

HELEN
(lightly)
Didn’t tell you didn’t want you to
have to arrest me

Eben shakes his head perplexed hands a second flash to
Stella as he looks back to Jake --

EBEN
Now I get why you moved into Helen’s
spare room --

JAKE
(protests too much)
Noooo I just thought you and Stella
oughta have privacy --

EBEN
Yeah that’s worked out real well
I’m heading for the cell tower

JAKE
(off the Stranger’s grin)
We have to stay here with him

STELLA
(a good pal for Jake)
Sure we can sit here and mock him

Jake beams appreciatively -- we can see he’s glad to have
Stella back around Eben notes it too but he’s too focused
on his yellow alert to respond --

EBEN
Helen as soon as the lines are up
get Billy over here Stay on the
walkie-talkie with me till the power’s
back --

Helen nods as the Stranger grins in expectation --

pistol ready He rounds a corner and stops pale --

The chain-link fence is down twisted and bent in the snow

down broken -- the antennas bent and snapped WIRES SPARKING

FROZEN BLOOD in the snow red and glossy Following the

in a tangle of wires and bent steel

CONTINUING THE SWEEP WITH HIS FLASHLIGHT -- EBEN SEES A POLE
STUCK IN THE ICE -- ATOP WHICH SITS GUS’S HEAD WIDE-EYED IN

this way and that squinting his way through the snowfall --
WHERE is her SCREAM coming from He searches the ground for
tracks but the snow’s already filling in his own footsteps
He circles about more and more anxious -- and loses his
breath as he sees there’s still a faint trail leading to THE
CRAWLSPACE UNDERNEATH THE HOUSE --

He kneels points his gun under the house -- and SOMETHING
GRABS HIM RIPS A SCAR ACROSS HIS FACE

HE EMPTIES BOTH BARRELS INTO THE FIGURE -- only to GASP as the
SHOTGUN IS TORN FROM HIS HANDS tossed away and lost ina
snowbank --

He drops to the ground HISSING IN PAIN and blinded by the
snow clutching his right leg -- the calf has been broken --

Riis clears his eyes drags himself crying in pain toward
Ally SHE’S SCREAMING and fighting like a banshee against a
shadowy figure Riis lunges for her grabs her hand --

But the creature easily drags her away -- Riis tries to hang

on which pulls him underneath the house himself until he can
no longer maintain his grip --

Which of you’ll they take first The

The kid Or the old gal

JAKE
SHUT UP

Jake loses it throws a game token at the Stranger who picks
it up gloating --

STRANGER
Thanks for the plastic I can snap
this apart use it to pick the lock --

The Stranger’s doing no such thing -- he’s just idly playing
with the token teasing Jake and leading him on --

JAKE
No you won’t --

STELLA
Jake he can’t --

Before Stella can stop him Jake heads for the cell --
unprepared as THE STRANGER GRABS JAKE AND PULLS HIM TIGHT
AGAINST THE CELL BARS --

JAKE GASPS IN PAIN trying to call out but unable to get his
breath as the Stranger slowly strangles him HISSING

Stella seethes hating this deal but having no choice As

reaches for the keyring --

Better hurry --

The keys CLANG as Stella reaches for the lock opening the
door --

for some window to act The Stranger moves an arm around the

Jake falls as well with Helen embracing him --

over the prone form of the Stranger soberly absorbing what
he’s done He looks to Helen concerned for her --

EBEN
Do you need to go home Take Jake

HELEN

EBEN
(searching for the words)
Someone -- took him apart

(nods toward the Stranger)

Eben checks the magazine in his pistol as Stella paces
restlessly ready for action --

Eben knows she’s right not going to give her the satisfaction
of acknowledging it He looks to Helen --

HELEN
We’ve got the walkie-talkies we’ll be
fine

Well be fine
Eben nods in appreciation to Helen turns curtly to Stella --

Stella swallows her temptation to talk back --
EXTINT STREETSEBEN’S 4X4 - NIGHT 37

Snowfall Stella drives through empty dark streets glancing
now and then at Eben careful not to let him see her doing so

When she focuses on the road Eben glances back at her also
not giving any ground But when he returns his gaze to the
road peering through the snow he suddenly lifts his gun --

EBEN
Stop the truck

STELLA
What

EBEN

STOP THE FUCKING TRUCK
She brakes quickly senses on high alert knowing where Eben’s
tone comes from They step out searching down the street
but there’s nothing visible in the snowy haze --

EBEN (cont’d)
I know I saw something --

Stella knows Eben too well to doubt him --

Eben nods curtly still staring dead ahead straining his eyes
through the blackness Stella reaches in the back of the

deep within in -- SHADOWS MOVING COMING RIGHT AT THEM --

Eben reaches for his gun --

WHAM WHAM WHAM The roof is POUNDED as MASSIVE DENTS
appear above their heads Eben’s window SHATTERS --

He reaches out and aims his pistol at the roof FIRING --

it under control and driving back to the station --

back on a desk short of breath staggered by the shock of
losing his grandmother -- he fumbles for his inhaler and gives
himself a BLAST --

EXT STREETSEBEN’S 4X4 - NIGHT 42

Snowfall Stella drives them off into the barren streets with
their ALARM LIGHTS FLASHING as --

DOWN THE STREET BEHIND THEM -- figures gather in a desolate
intersection watching When we can catch a glimpse of them
through the shadows they are gaunt dead-pale of varying
heights and ages from young to seasoned to ancient Their
breath does not cloud in the cold They wear blacks greys
and browns their clothing old and worn most of it scavenged
from the dead Their eyes are ENTIRELY BLACK diamond-hard
and shiny so that the snow sometimes reflects in them They
walk like humans would -- if humans were nothing but muscle
and hunger and cruel cunning

Seventeen of them swarm around the alpha leader of the group --
MARLOW Mid 30s feral ragged relentless He cracks the
frozen blood on his face lets it fall as he HISSES in an
ancient glottal unrecognizable language --

contradicted even as he knows she’s right --

If we’d headed there when this all
started we might’ve made it But

They rack their brains Doug watches them anxiously sweating
in hope that somebody has an answer --

down ladder you can’t tell it’s
there it’d be tight but we could fit

He would’ve boarded up his home before

(this time HE’S right)
Which is why it’s a good idea We can
pull down a board to get in then tack
it back --

trust most right now He settles on his friend Carter --

Falling into the dash Eben and Stella reach for firearms --

while anyone else would be reeling this creature’s only

stunned by the shot -- its jaws are still open slavering --

as his gun is grabbed and hurled away into the snow --

He looks over to see Marlow and Iris dragging Stella from her
side of the 4x4 as A GRITTY ROAR RISES FROM NOWHERE --

Eben lunges for her desperately but he’s being pulled out his
own side of the 4x4 Their eyes lock they’re about to die --

Until the GRITTY ROAR CLIMAXES a SNOWPLOW careens out of
nowhere SLAMS Stella’s attackers into a brick wall --

Beau Brower is behind the wheel He reaches out hauls Stella
in She stretches for her dropped gun but there’s no time --

Quick goddamn it

Eben’s attackers turn toward the snowplow -- Eben scrambles
and grabs onto the passenger side as Beau FLOORS IT --

Eben and Stella are both still clambering inside the cab as
Beau’s driving off he can’t linger an extra second for them
As they land beside Beau Eben and Stella instinctively look
at each other eyes wide -- they’ve just seen each other
nearly killed and it’s hit them each where they live --

attackers has latched onto the rear bumper and starts to climb
toward the front of the snowplow as Beau ROARS AWAY --

get fragged

Eben nods a little too distracted to acknowledge the point
any more than that as Beau checks the sideview mirrors -- all
clear Then he checks his rearview --

THE IMAGE OF THE CREATURE’S EYES AND FANGS FILLS THE REARVIEW
Beau freaks for a moment -- then WHIPS the snowplow under a
LOW-HANGING CANOPY SHEARING OFF THE CREATURE as he rounds
another corner not sure he’s believing what he’s just done --

it won’t help but it couldn’t hurt when --

look to each other --

inspects the hallway ceiling --

Maybe they filed their teeth down and
they’re some sort of cult

hope so much and Eben finds a bit more of his stride --

brutally grab Doug by the neck and stare him down --

The more of us go the more chance
well be seen

BEAU
I’m coming with you

Agreeing Stella rises reaching for her gear --

EBEN
Protecting this attic is the first
priority --
(aside to Stella private)
Stella these folks need hope you’re
better at that --

Stella nods she doesn’t like it but he’s right Eben
reaches for the pistol -- and Beau hefts up his shotgun --

BEAU
So let’s go Eben --

EBEN
I don’t want company

BEAU
Didn’t ask what you want lLet’s move

EBEN
Beau I’m Sheriff of this town it’s
my job to keep you all safe --

DOUG
Yeah hell of a job you’ve been doing

Eben stares daggers at Doug while Stella turns to Beau --

STELLA
Listen We have two firearms Eben’s
taking the pistol he found downstairs
We need the bigger weapon here with
us Beau We need you here

DOUG
I shot one of them to hell he just
shrugged it off Weapons won’t help

BEAU
(pugnacious)
Maybe YOURS wont

Beau takes a post with his shotgun by the trapdoor Eben
leans into Stella as he leaves whispers to her --

EBEN
Told you you’re better with people --

Stella looks back evenly not giving him any ground Holding
his breath Eben quietly lowers the staircase and leaves
Once he’s gone Stella corners Doug taking no prisoners --

STELLA
I hear another slam at Eben from you
I‘1l throw you to those things myself

DOUG
(taken aback)
-- I thought you and he were --

STELLA
Thinking That’s where it all goes
awry for you Doug

She turns away and looks outside apprehensively -- her
thoughts with Eben despite everything --

68A EXT STREETS - NIGHT 68A

In the starlight white now with exhaustion and pain Kirsten
Toomey makes another circuit of the town -- now some distance
from the Kelso house --

KIRSTEN
-- hello -- anybody --

She rounds a corner to find Marlow Iris and four other
vampires looking at her hungrily --

KIRSTEN (contd)
Please -- I tried -- there’s nobody
left -- please God --

The vampires circle her slowly deliberately The pale
fleshy ARCHIBALD and the cadaverous Arvin look to Marlow
still SPEAKING THEIR ANCIENT TONGUE --

ARCHIBALD
(rasp of hunger)

ARVIN
(sycophantic plea)

MARLOW
(permission to begin)

The vampires nod with Marlow’s go-ahead -- then we see one
FLASH OF A CLAW -- there is a red streak on Kirsten’s face --
69-75

75A

ANOTHER CLAW FLASHES THEN ANOTHER -- bit by bit she’s being
carved away as the vampires each take a turn circling closer
and closer --

While around the CORNER OF THE CLOSEST HOUSE -- Eben sidles
into view -- fighting not to be crushed by the discovery that
Kirsten is beyond help --

And as he leans against the house in a moment of grief --

A DRIFT OF SNOW FALLS FROM THE HOUSE TO THE SNOW A THUD that
makes two vampires turn in his direction as Eben steals off --

OMITTED 69-75
EXT RIIS HOME - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 75A

Eben hurries to flatten himself against an exterior wall of
the house between supplies for Riis’s sled dogs He works to
control his breath -- the sudden move threatening to set off
his asthma -- while in the distance he sees the two vampires
searching heading off He may be safe for the moment --
until his BLOOD RUNS COLD AS HE HEARS

RIIS (0S)
Ebennnn --

EBEN’S POV Across the street in the shadows of the
crawlspace under his house is an agonized John Reese

EBEN
John how long have you been out here

RIIS
(disoriented)
-- not sure --

Eben can sense something’s not quite right about Reese though
it’s not clear what --

EBEN
Where’s Ally --

RIIS
They took her -- they bit my face
then took her -- couldn’t follow leg
hurts -- so cold --

EBEN

Hang on we’ll get you to safety --

RIIS
So hungry -- so hungry --

Eben edges to the edge of the house all is quiet He reaches
out a hand to Riis --

EBEN
I‘1l pull you out -- just stay quiet --

Eben hauls Riis forward Riis uses his left leg only to help
propel himself Eben tugs the gasping Riis to his feet
bracing him --

And in the moonlight we can now see that RIIS’S SCAR HAS
TURNED BLACK -- HIS EYES HAVE TURNED VAMPIRE-BLACK --

RIIS
Ebennnnnn --

He opens his mouth wide -- his gums have dried up making his
incisors look as long as fangs He aims for Eben’s face --

Eben sees it just in time -- slugs Riis in the stomach --

He pulls away slipping on ice losing his gun in deep snow
Riis falls dazed -- but driven by inexplicable hunger he
limps after Eben who charges off searching for cover --

EXT RIIS BACKYARD - NIGHT 76
Eben charges through Riis’s backyard -- but one snowdrift is
deeper than he expects and he loses his balance reaching out

to the chains on a child’s swingset to right himself --

Riis lunges for Eben the two tangled in the chains unable to
escape each other Reese’s jaws strain to reach Eben --

Eben pulls out his pistol but Riis pries it from Eben’s
grasp dropping it so it disappears in the snow --

EBEN
What the hell happened to you --

Riis blinks his eyes he truly doesn’t know what happened to
him Eben searches about in panic his BREATH GROWING RASPIER
AND RASPIER finally seeing --

A PILE OF FIREWOOD ON THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE -- AND AN AXE

Eben strains the chains of the swing -- it’1ll mean letting go
of Riis for a moment but he dives to reach the axe --

Riis free now yearns toward Eben jaws salivating about to
clamp his teeth down on Eben’s neck --

Eben swings the axe hard CATCHING Riis in the shoulder --

RIIS
(in pain but still going)
EBENNNNNNNN --

Black blood flows from Riis’s wound as Eben wriggles loose
gets his bearings and then SWINGS AGAIN AND AGAIN -- focusing
on Eben’s pain as he’s forced to do what must be done --

Finally he staggers back against the woodpile groping for his
inhaler GIVING HIMSELF A BLAST But it’s the last blast --
Eben tosses the now-useless inhaler into the snow He’s not
sure how he’1l make it without the inhaler but for now he has
no choice PAN from Eben toward the swingset where a
headless corpse hangs caught up in the chains of the swings

INT KELSO HOME - NIGHT 77

Stella and Beau meet a drained Eben sweeping his tracks They
pull the board closed as Eben joins them inside with his axe --

EBEN
-- lost my gun --

BEAU
-- wouldn’ta done any good anyway --

EBEN

-- think there’s close to twenty of
them but there might as well be two
hundred -- they’re watching
everywhere don’t know what they’re
planning --

(the worst revelation)
-- and John became one of them

Stella and Beau try to absorb this -- it can’t be true --

STELLA
How’d you stop him

Eben nods grimly toward his bloodied axe --

EBEN
Nothing lives without a head

Stella watches Eben wrestling with what he’s done --

STELLA
You had to

EBEN
I may have to again -- they can turn
us into them --

STELLA
Oh God --
Stella and Eben wrestle with the shock -- the world is so much
more horrible than they ever dreamed -- as Beau examines the

bloodied axe soberly eyes full of dread

attic with a sudden apprehension --

STELLA (cont’d)
If we tell everyone they’1ll panic --

EBEN
People deserve to know

BEAU
And if they don’t know they could get
us killed -- they gotta get what’s at
stake --

STELLA
(still not sure)
How do we tell them

EBEN
(a beat)
How do we not

JAKE
You sure you don’t want the last
(Stella shakes her head)
I used to like the little devil on
these cans

STELLA
If we can last till daylight’s back --
they didn’t show up till sundown
Maybe they can’t stand the light
It’s only two and a half weeks --

He looks to Iris
Who could have

Jake scoops the last from a can of Deviled

DENISE
(a helpless laugh)
Yeah that’s all

DOUG
We can’t hold out without food --

LUCY
What about other houses People
mightve left something

EBEN
They could be hiding and living on it
themselves There were 152 folks in
town Billy and his family Paul
Jayko the Robbinses Adam and
Jeannie we’re not the only ones left

The others look toward the outside considering as Eben shows
them a crude map he’s drawn on the back of a traffic ticket --

EBEN (cont’d)

Look Before too long there’1ll be a
blizzard And when it happens we
just need to walk

(indicating on the map)
Each lot in town’s twenty-five feet
wide So the general store’s two
hundred seventy-five feet east The
Utilidor’s seventy-five west then due
north as far as you can go We can
hit the store for food and then burrow
down in the Utilidor

(as the others absorb it)
We know this town We can walk it
blindfolded We just have to wait for
the weather we’ve lived with since we
were born

The survivors stir with hope even Doug takes a breath and
finds a bit of patience Stella turns privately toward Eben
taking him aside --

STELLA
Hey You know how you told me you
could never be a dad Bullshit The
way you look out for these people --

EBEN
Don’t compliment me you’ll just
confuse me
79A-79B

STELLA
It’s not a compliment It’s an
attempt to ram something through that
concrete skull you can pull off more
than you think you can

EBEN
(a beat)
Not if I have to worry my wife’ll run
away when we can’t work something out

They glare at each other in frustration -- not sure why every
conversation between them has to end in a quarrel --

INT KELSO HOME - NIGHT 81

Isaac has lowered the ladder he’s walking downstairs --
Stella follows him with her flashlight WHISPERING URGENTLY
Unlike everyone else who must not speak above a hiss Isaac
speaks in his normal full voice calm and determined --

ISAAC
I’m walking to Wainwright --

STELLA
It’s eighty miles there’s no way to
get there Come back upstairs --

Wilson descends the staircase alarmed --

ISAAC
Wilson Come along we need to get
out Bring your mother too --

Stella holds onto Isaac before he can reach the front door he
works to shake her off

STELLA
We’‘ll die if you go out there --

ISAAC
(angry now)
NO NO ILL DIE IF I STAY IN HERE --—

Stella clamps a hand over Isaac’s mouth Stella and Wilson
struggle to hold Isaac back -- he wriggles and writhes until
finally he CRIES and stops resisting --

ISAAC (contd)
(WHISPERING AT LAST)

I’m sorry -- Jesus look at me -- I’m
so sorry --
WILSON
(lost for words)
It’s all right Dad -- anyone would --
STELLA
Just stay quiet Mr Bulosan --
ISAAC
(looks around confused)
Can I -- the bathroom --
STELLA

Remember you can’t flush the noise --
we’‘ll just open the valve afterward --

Isaac nods not understanding fully but cooperating for now
They lead him delicately to the bathroom and Wilson closes the
door on his father -- then slides down the wall drained
Stella tries to encourage him --

STELLA (cont’d)
What are the odds we would make it
this long We’re ahead of the curve

WILSON
Every day they need more food
They’1l be back

STELLA

Maybe they’1ll starve first Ever
think of that We can see in the
empty houses they’re not rifling
through pantries they’re not living
on frozen food --

WILSON
We’re their frozen food --

Suddenly a SLIDING RASP from inside the bathroom They look
to each other in alarm Wilson TAPS on the door --

WILSON (cont’d)
Dad
(silence)
Dad --
(rising to Stella)
Should we break in

STELLA
The noise

She pulls out her drivers license slips it through the door
to manipulate it open She shines her flashlight inside --

Revealing an empty bathroom -- and an OPEN WINDOW
Wilson turns and runs for the front Stella catches him --

STELLA (cont’d)
Wait You can’t just rush out there

WILSON
HE’S MY FATHER --
Wilson tugs loose -- Stella reaches for him again Without
warning he turns around and SLUGS her flat -- she lands with a

THUMP as Wilson escapes out the front door --
INT ATTIC - NIGHT - SIMULTANEOUS 82
The THUMP makes Eben’s eyes blink instantly awake --

EBEN
Stella --

He searches the room Only Doug and Lucy are awake Lucy
points down the ladder Eben bolts up disoriented and
alarmed and reaches for his axe --

INT KELSO HOME - NIGHT 83

Eben descends the ladder warily axe ready -- only to find
Stella dazed on the floor where she fell --

EBEN
What the hell happened

STELLA
I’m fine thanks --

He knows that but he’s too alarmed at the signs of danger to
say anything of comfort --

EBEN
How long has this ladder been down
STELLA
(getting her bearings)
Oh God -- maybe five minutes --

Eben lifts the ladder back into place as Stella rises --

STELLA (cont’d)
Isaac took off for Wainwright Wilson
went to find him --

EBEN
And you let them go

Stella rubs her jaw archly --

STELLA
Yeah that’s just what I did

EXT STREET - NIGHT 84
Wilson moves quickly risking death every second he’s out --
in the attic he was only wearing a down vest unprepared for
the savagery of the cold --
WILSON
(hissing)

Dad Dad --

Silence SNOW BEGINS TO FALL WIND GROWS Wilson looks to
the sky down an alley under a house growing desperate --

The loose door of a house SLAMS in the wind -- Wilson
startles backing away from the house --

Shivering teeth starting to chatter he’s realizing this is a
very BAD idea but he can’t abandon his father --

WILSON (cont’d)

Daaaad --
His breath billows -- he wipes snow and tears from his face --
steps into a small snowbank -- and is suddenly PULLED THE REST

OF THE WAY IN --

He starts to GASP -- when his cries are MUFFLED IN THE SNOW
Second by second the snowbank turns RED WITH HIS BLOOD

INT KELSO HOUSE - NIGHT 85
Eben and Stella simmer bitter with losing Wilson --

EBEN
You should’ve stopped him

STELLA
I fucking tried

EBEN
Oh yeah How hard Part of you
probably thought of course he should
look for his dad right

STELLA
(a beat stung)
At least Wilson went out doing what he
had to for his family --

Eben can’t believe she’s throwing this at him now -- tersely
he returns the favor --

EBEN
Or he was just screwed because someone
ran out on him

Eben and Stella stare each other down -- too angry to know how
to work through this until --

ANEERIE SCRATCHING SUDDENLY FILLS THE ROOM ABOVE
Eben and Stella scramble upstairs and pull the ladder closed --

freaking everyone as Eben moves to kill the propane heater --

EBEN

Get down -- cover up --

Eben Stella and Jake flatten against the wall by the
peephole The others dive under sleeping blankets -- fighting
to stay quiet and remain still --

THE SCRABBLING MOVES FROM ONE SIDE OF THE ROOF TO ANOTHER --
THEN IT DOUBLES AND TRIPLES AS IF THERE ARE THREE CREATURES
ON THE ROOF NOW --

Lucy quivers Denise and even Doug both tremble as they feel
surrounded --

There is silence for a moment -- the survivors wonder if they
can relax --

THEN DENISE STIFLES A SCREAM AS A CRUEL BLACK EYE LOOKS IN
THROUGH THE WINDOW SEARCHING --

Eben tenses his breathing tight and thin Stella and Jake
look to him in concern --

After an achingly fearful moment the eye disappears the
SCRABBLING SOUNDS STOP

Eben looks to the others his voice tight with congestion and
alarm -- clearly the Kelso house is compromised now --

EBEN (cont’d)

It’s snowing -- grab trashbags from

downstairs we’re getting all the food

we can carry --
But his breathing is also compromised -- Eben’s chest heaves

sucking in air Stella approaches sotto voce

STELLA
Your inhaler --
DOUG
(not sure he heard that)
What --
EBEN
(between breaths)
Useless -- threw it in the snow --
DOUG
WHAT --
STELLA DOUG
What’re you going to do Wait a minute wait a minute
without an inhaler Do they what You’ve got like some
have them in the store -- kinda breathing problem
Eben nods tersely to both of them fighting for breath as
Doug reappraises Eben in a panic --
DOUG (contd)
We’re following your plans and you’re
keeping secrets What else don’t we
know --
EBEN

(had enough of this)
-- shut up Doug --

DOUG
Fuck no YOU shut up

Furious Doug SHOVES Eben back -- and even through his pained
breaths Eben BACKHANDS Doug into the wall Stella intercedes
as Eben braces himself against Jake pulling in air --

STELLA
Jesus Doug

BEAU
(over re Eben)
He’s right we need food --

Doug’s about to speak again when Jake SLAMS him to the floor

JAKE
What the hell When the shit went
down who kept it together You were
busy shouting “They can’t be shot”

on the living room floor wrenched from their hiding place
Adam a newly-fired pistol in his hand stares in amazement --

Marlow BLOOD DRIPPING FROM HIS CHEST glares at them while
ripping the gun from Adam’s hands He speaks in a GUTTERAL
RASP -- his English not easy his accent unplaceable --

MARLOW
You had your chance to help us find
your friends Now you’1ll have to
watch

Marlow lifts up Adam reaches for a fireplace poker and
IMPALES Adam through the guts and into the wall Choking in
pain Adam is unable to move as Marlow takes Adam’s chin and
directs his gaze toward Iris --

MARLOW (cont’d)
Iris You may take your time

Neither Marlow nor Iris takes any sadistic pleasure from this
it’s simply the price that Adam and Jeannie must pay for
resistance Iris reaches for a hand of the terrified sobbing
Jeannie -- WE HEAR HIS FINGERS SNAPPING ONE AT A TIME --

ADAM
NOOOOcCO0000 --

Marlow not as distracted by this as he wishes he could be
drops his hold on Adam wanders to the stereo system As
Jeannie GASPS in the bg with each finger SNAPPED Marlow
rests a talon on a phonograph record sitting on the turntable
It’s almost as if through his talons he listens to the music
in the record grooves his thoughts alive but unreadable --

energized for a plan a plan not everyone trusts yet --

Melanson the kid we met kissing his girlfriend farewell --

Oh honey you need to come with --

The girl turns and looks at them Her mouth is covered in
blood and we see now that it’s Tom Melanson who’s doing the
sobbing -- the girl is a vampire --

She places a taloned hand on Tom’s jaw and RIPS as she eyes
them eerily --

as a weapon while the others charge back into the store --

shovel clattering uselessly behind him Eben drops his
beartraps brandishes an axe ready to swing --

But the little girl careens out of the storage room like a
dervish presenting a smaller target than Eben expected -- he
swings over her head and she knocks him down --

The little girl’s about to pounce on Eben when Stella grabs
her from behind and THROWS HER AWAY DOWN THE AISLE --

Doug pulls Denise toward the front as Carter reaches for a
can of MACE and sprays it into the little girl’s face --

IT SHRIEKS and only lunges for Carter all the harder ripping
off his cap and baring her fangs --

But now Eben’s back -- he charges the girl and fights to pin
her against the wall -- she kicks and spits like a snake --

her long --

automatic nervous movement for a few moments Eben Stella

knocked for a loop by what he’s done fighting tears --

Eben studies his old friend hearing how Carter’s offering
himself for that role --

brought the sun early

operation at home --

Stella’s fighting for strength she and Gail both suffering
from the chills their skin turning brittle and blue She

EBEN (0S) (cont’d)
They’re up to something can’t tell
what -- just run like hell if I call --

Stella CLICKS TWICE to acknowledge him --

Eben takes a breath determined to do something as rough for
him as surviving in the cold is for Stella --

EBEN (0S) (cont’d)

just couldn’t see how to --

(stepping up to the plate)
Listen We get through this -- when

desperation -- it would be so easy to go to sleep forever --

But within moments Eben’s breath becomes fuller dee
takes the inhaler and stares at it in amazement --

EXT UTILIDOR - NIGHT 210
Smoke floods the air -- down the road the town is in full

blaze Suddenly the door KICKS OPEN -- and Eben emerges
fighting for balance unaccustomed to his new senses

squinting through the smoke face torn with pain and mission --

Like the vampires Eben’s breath does not billow in the cold
but he’s wrapped up in winter gear so that no one notices --

Eben works for his bearings -- then trudges directly toward
Marlow the CRUNCH of his steps in the ice making Marlow turn
Marlow recognizes Eben HISSING vindictively --

MARLOW
The one who fights

Eben nods -- the angry bond between himself and Marlow clear
He keeps walking steadily toward Marlow The other vampires

circle but Marlow cautions them back with a wave of his arm --

he doesn’t need doesn’t want any help for dealing with Eben
No this will be a pleasure

Eben lurches toward the other vampires for a moment -- they
watch uncertain what the hell he has in mind --

Then he resumes trudging toward Marlow as Marlow shakes his
head nearly pitying how far gone Eben appears to be --

way through their smoky coffin toward the outside --

stumble out yearning for safety legs shaky from a day’s
worth of cold and inaction --

EXT UTILIDOR - NIGHT 214
Eben pushes forward knowing any moment might be his last --

Finally he’s nearly two yards away from Marlow -- and suddenly
he reaches for Marlow trying to grab at him with surprising
speed But Marlow BACKHANDS HIM INTO THE ICE --

Eben struggles to his feet throws a fist at Marlow -- who
catches the fist and throws Eben back --

Eben lunges again for Marlow knocking him down for a moment --

Then Marlow SNARLING HURLS HIMSELF at Eben ripping at him
again and again tearing his parka loose battering his face
and body mercilessly --

Eben desperately crawls trying to get his feet under him --

Until Marlow pulls him by his hair and WHIPS him bitterly
face up against the ice --

Eben GASPS for breath fighting to suck in some strength --
his mouth is bloody and the blood makes the ice slicker as
they fight --

Zurial and the other vampires watch intently -- impressed by
Eben’s ability to survive against Marlow even this long --

STELLA -- stops with Gail seeing through the smoke that in
the crowd ahead her husband is fighting for all their lives --

MARLOW -- REACHES DOWN AND ENCIRCLES EBEN’S LEFT HAND IN HIS
CLAWLIKE FINGERS -- HE SQUEEZES AND SQUEEZES RELENTLESSLY
UNTIL WE HEAR THE SNAPPING OF BONES --

Eben fights not to feel the pain but HIS VISION IS BLURRING
it’s hard to see how much longer he can last --

He glances to the night sky above --

EXT SKIES - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 215
IS IT A FEW DEGREES LIGHTER THAN IT SEEMED A MOMENT AGO

EXT UTILIDOR - NIGHT 216
Zurial and the other vampires look to the sky warily tensing
at the knowledge that the night is almost gone -- realizing

they face a decision --

Marlow circles Eben gloating in triumph --

Eben summons up his strength and butts his head into Marlow
knocking him onto the ice --

Insulted Marlow SPITS FERALLY and regains his haunches like
a wolf who will not give up his prey --

Eben wobbles for a moment on the ice but determines to keep
the momentum on his side With brutal drive he bolts toward
Marlow his left arm hanging limply with its fingers now
broken ready to strike another blow --

AT THE PUMP HOUSE DOOR -- Jake Denise and Lucy watch in
dread helpless if Eben fails --

ON THE ICE -- the permafrost CRACKS as Marlow dodges Eben and
WHACKS him into the unforgiving ground again and again It’s
a savage onslaught that makes Eben’s very skull seem to SHAKE
from the impact --

Eben knows he needs a moment to recoup -- he tries to crawl
away to gain a breather --

But Marlow drags him back mercilessly as the smoke whirls
around them Eben’s face lacerating against the ice --

Then he grabs Eben’s throat with one hand lifting him up from
the frozen ground with a sadistic smile --

Marlow hurls Eben to the ground -- KICKS HIS FACE VICIOUSLY
and then towers over Eben --

FROM THE TOWN -- a handful of tattered drained survivors
driven north by the smoke and fire emerge to watch in awe
struggling to understand what is happening -- the gaunt
veterans of thirty days of night mute witnesses to this
battle that will decide their fates JOINING A TRANSFIXED
STELLA AND GAIL --

ON THE ICE -- Eben struggles to remain conscious searching
about until he sees --

STELLA -- her heart breaking her eyes filled with both HOPE
AND GRIEF He takes it all in --

Marlow follows Eben’s gaze seeing Stella as well With a
cruel smile he drops Eben stalking toward Stella ready to
rob Eben of his companion even as Eben ruined Marlow’s toy --

Eben seeing Marlow heading for Stella WRENCHES HIMSELF OFF
THE ICE and hurls himself at Marlow --

They tumble together a small chaos of fury and bloodlust --
as Marlow emerges on top ready to finish Eben off --

Marlow bares his fangs -- this last kill will be so very
satisfying --
Eben’s eyes are nearly swollen shut -- his face is a mass of

welts and agony --

BUT THEN EBEN FORCES HIS EYES WIDE STARING UP AT HIS ENEMY --
AND HIS DEATH-BLACK PUPILS MATCH THOSE OF MARLOW --

Marlow hesitates for a nanosecond confused --

Eben facing his last does the thing he didn’t think he could
do -- he reaches into his depths and pulls up the ferocity and
strength of a wildcat --

Reaching up he takes hold of Marlow’s jaw with his wounded
hand and in a berserker rage SLAMS HIS GOOD HAND ALL THE WAY
INTO MARLOW’S MOUTH --

The vampires gape in AWE AT THE SOUND OF RIPPING FLESH --

And MARLOW’S HEAD lands on the ice in a rush of red pain and

shock still not realizing he’s lost His eyes close -- he is
gone
Eben stares blinking astonished by it all unable to

comprehend for a moment that he’s won Slowly he pulls
himself to his knees --

Zurial looks grimly to the sky -- two other vampires take a
step back retreating as their night runs out --

The survivors at the pump house BREATHE IN DEEPLY unable to
contain their swelling hope --

STELLA -- however sees there’s something far worse to learn
yet -- she runs to Eben kneeling beside him on the ice --
STELLA

-- what did you do to yourself

EBEN
(a solemn beat)
What I had to

She embraces him desperately -- overwhelmed by his sacrifice
He fights his way to his feet looking at Marlow’s blood on
his hands He needs it -- the blood would taste so very good
But he can’t bring himself to go there --

Clenching his jaw he looks around -- THE VAMPIRES ARE
ENTIRELY GONE --

EBEN (cont’d)
Should I go after them

STELLA
They won’t come back

Gail looks about lost and overwhelmed --

Seeing Gail Eben looks to Stella in silent sacred agreement
Stella takes Eben’s meaning and nods kneeling to Gail --

STELLA (cont’d)
Come here sweetheart --

Stella folds a grateful Gail in her arms then reaches out to
include Jake as well -- her new family

JAKE

Stella looks up to the skies apprehensive --

dawn Stella holds onto Gail and Jake for balance weak as
she realizes the full extent of Eben’s transformation --

Denise turns to the survivors --

DENISE

hydrants see what we can save --

Lucy and Jake join the other Barrowites moving to recapture
their town Stella rises from Gail’s side to caress Eben’s
cheek her face wet with tears --

for you --

EBEN (contd)
It’s getting hard to fight -- I’m
forgetting everything but the pain
There’s just one place for me to go --

He turns wishing to spare Stella what is to come --

STELLA

OFF Eben heartened by knowing Stella’s standing by him --
EXT SUMMIT - DAWN 219
In the distance the smoke curls up slowly now from Barrow --
the flames have subsided Much of the town is charred but
there is still a town worth reclaiming

Eben and Stella sit together as the sun edges over the distant

icy horizon Eben his skin a landscape of agony shivers
while Stella grasps his hands with both hands --

EBEN
-- I sent Billy to take you to the
airport -- knew he wouldn’t make it --

wanted you to stay --
A grateful nod from Stella she always suspected it She
works to contain her fears as he winces not sure he can
endure the pain any longer --

EBEN (cont’d)

Baby --
STELLA
I’m here I’m here with you
EBEN
Listen -- listen to me --
STELLA
(time slipping away)
Yes -- I’m here I’m listening --
EBEN
I could live forever -- but I don’t
want to breathe another second -- if I
can’t remember what it feels like to

love you --

Fighting back tears because they can’t risk missing a moment
together their eyes lock Everything they’ve ever said to
each other everything they’ve never said and should have it
all passes between them --

THE SUN STARES DOWN AT THEM BEAUTIFUL AND DEADLY SEARING
THEM WITH LETHAL RADIANCE CAMERA CIRCLES AROUND THEM as
Eben winces gasps in pain --

Stella throws her arms around him for dear life --

Eben’s skin finishes CHARRING TO BLACK as Stella holds him --
within moments he is dead

CLOSE ON STELLA THE SUN REFLECTED IN HER EYES AS HER HEART
BREAKS FOR EBEN AND HIS SACRIFICE PULL CLOSER AND CLOSER ON
STELLA UNTIL --

CUT TO BLACK
