102 INT SUBURBAN SEMI DAY

Vaughn sits in the conservatory and drinks his morning tea
His gaze out into the garden is broken by something in the
cup in the tea that gets his attention Troubled and
preoccupied he frowns as he looks at the tea in the tea cup

His daughter PIP rushes into the conservatory in her
pyjamas and throws herself on him her beloved wonderful

She doesnt look at Vaughn
Vaughn watches in a distracted way

As she speaks SUPERSUBTITLE the real meaning of her words

What the fuck is wrong with you

Vaughn grunts something then goes to help her but its half

hearted He can barely remember where the cereal goes

MIA
Wrong time of the month

Vaughn laughs slightly too loudly Still no eye contact
His mind elsewhere he helps her put the shopping away

Mia takes a deep breath to control herself

MIA
Dont worry Seriously

SUPER

I love you with every fibre To the end
Vaughn holds a can of soup - all thats left of his dignity
Mia puts the shopping away in the cupboards and the fridge
The tension is palpable Silence strangles them both
Mia finishes putting things away without looking at him
The last item goes in the last cupboard Bags are stored
A beat Vaughns body is wracked by guilty tension

MIA
(still no eye contact)

You out later then darling

SUPER
Dont do this to me - please
Vaughn hides his torment and indecision as best he can

VAUGHN

Outside the house Vaughn throws an overnight bag onto the back
seat of the car He gets into the car He slams the door shut

He starts the engine

against the biting cold He checks his mobile again Nothing
The unthinkable crosses his face Surely not But then

BROOKE walks across the playground toward him She sees
him hurries It takes him a moment to recognise her That
troubles him He smiles at her his first smile in a long
time Her smile speaks of very real joy after very real pain

He stands in order to greet her She tries not to cry but
its impossible She embraces and kisses him passionately

She looks at him like hes all she ever wanted He sees
disguised scars on her face The scars of pain in her eyes

His mobile phone bleeps a text message He ignores it

VAUGHN
Come on You dont owe me

He grabs her kisses her He looks like a man trying to
convince himself that if he ignores it reality will go away

Emotion overwhelms her so she gets busy with the tea Vaughn
looks around again and out of the window A cheap view too

BROOKE

This place is huge Its also soulless and grim Row upon row
of gated storage areas are crammed with peoples belongings

Between these rows walks CY (50s) with female admin staffer

stopped searching for his dreams Self-dissatisfaction hatred
even haunts his tired face He doesnt want to be here

DOLORES

a charge for that

Of course there is

They approach a storage area numbered 110 Dolores reaches for
a skeleton key attached to her belt by a security chain

There is an unusually long delay before Mo responds

Mo approaches and stops when he reaches DOLORES

MO

smiles however the smile seems out of place on his face

MO
No worries Doll

Mo laughs A strange laugh She throws him an angry face
DOLORES

She heads off pulling one last face at Mo as she goes

Cys voice is barely audible as he rummages in boxes
Mo looks in at him He gets a text checks it and responds

With a ‘ha Cy pulls something out of a box Mo waits As he
does so he shifts his weight from his right foot to his left

Cy emerges from the storage area looking flushed with effort

Thanks
MO

Mo goes to lock storage area 110 Cy looks at the object he
has retrieved an old VHS video cassette Mo sees it

MO
Wow thats an old VHS isnt it

manager who has been like a
surrogate father to him for
years now turns against him
disgusted that the boy he
believed in turned out to
be a lamentable sausage jockey
Am I right

Cy is too smashed and bloody and ruined to do more than grunt
But something catches his eye in the filthy gloom he sees a
WHITE feather lying on the ground in the corner of 222

from beginning to end a truth
so hideous that it could be
called ordinary A verity of

play the game

of psychology

And then imagine the one

person the liar could turn to
turning away
was left with nothing but the

lie

so that the liar

Imagine exploding with

the desire to be what you

are

to be real and to be

accepted for what you are
perhaps even loved Not loved
with money for playing games
but loved with respect for
having the strength to stand

apart

Imagine that But the

works of the imagination must
cede to that we call reality

Austen attacks him but Jaden restrains him

He gets a text He checks the message Doesnt reply

A police car cruises Jaden doesnt react to it but he does
so in a way that suggests that this is a measured response

He grabs his phone hits some keys Someone picks up

JADEN

Where you at fam Nah Nah My

Owe ya back boy Easy now

He kills the call stows his mobile
A car slows near him and stops at traffic lights Jadens
attention is drawn by a WHITE feather on the back window

shelf A shadow crosses Jadens face The car pulls away

He approaches a group of young male hoodies smoking and
texting outside a corner store They greet with touched fists

Jaden talks with a few of them and then walks on Its clear
that he has their respect though they show it very subtly

Jadens hands are together in respect for Paul Austen
deliberately pays no attention to the ritual at all

PAUL
for this gift of daily
bread we thank thee oh Lord

Jaden throws Austen a look Mean and fierce And now suddenly
we see what hes capable of Fear overcomes Austens
arrogance He puts his hands together and closes his eyes

PAUL
and for the gift of these
fine sons I thank thee oh Lord

The crucifix on the wall Christs tormented face in the cheap
shadows of this dull crappy kitchen Its all Paul has
PAUL
beseech thee to look down
on them and protect them with
thy everlasting mercy
Seeing Jadens eyes now closed in prayer for Pauls sake
Austen cant resist feeling the wad of new cash in his pocket

359 INT PAULS ROOM - EVENING
Later a knock on Pauls door No response Jaden pushes the
door open a crack revealing Paul lost and alone on his bed in
a tiny sliver of light among infinite council house darkness
Seen like this the marks life has left on Paul are obvious
JADEN
(a whisper)

Goin out dad OK

Paul just frowns He seems too tired to speak He expresses
“come back safely in a way that is very hard to bear

Jaden enters the room He tucks his old man up in bed safe
Then he leaves the room quietly and pulls the door shut safe
He goes downstairs and exits the house quietly

The ceramic Christ on the Cross in the hallway is silent

360 EXT E3 EVENING
Jaden walks He is assured and cool This is his stage

He feels the bulge in his belt at the base of his spine

He gets a text He checks the message likes it He replies

He takes a call makes another texts and talks Smooth

urban landscape dancing to the beat of his feet But

Apparently mild mannered URI (40s) writes on his desktop He
is dressed like an accountant conservative but efficient

His blue stocking home counties WIFE enters with a tray of
tea She puts the tray down and passes Uri a cup of tea

WIFE
Wont be long

Clicking off the Word Window on which hes working on his
computer quickly he responds with a nondescript smile

She kisses his forehead and exits the room

Uri re-opens the Window on his computer He looks out of the
window Uri is living with something that cant be lived with

He swigs from a bottle of JD that he retrieves from a drawer
He turns back to the computer reads what hes written

URI VO
But now the buck must stop
Exculpation is no longer
an option The state has
lied to you Mrs Pentane and
whatever the consequences I
feel it my duty to put the
record straight Why I feel
thus obliged will become
apparent should we meet I
leave that up to you

has pulled a muscle Shaved headed Thug2 pulls a face

THUGH2

Get some deep heat on it

URI
(frustrated)
If were kindly ready Mister Tyne

Uri then goes back to reading his novel
Thug2 almost smiles almost Not a face made for smiling
Thug1 works out the tension in the pulled muscle He then
PUNCHES
NICHOLAS (30s) aman tied naked to an old chair
Nicholas is a mass of cuts sores burns and untreated wounds
He is filthy and unshaven He is delirious with agony
Nicholas barely reacts to the blow hes too far gone
URI

(without looking up from his book)

Nicholas its really so very

simple

Nicholas tries to open a swollen bloodshot eye He cant

Uri nods to Thugl again but now Thug1 pulls his blood
soiled rubber gloves off He goes to put a new pair on

Uri puts his book down and pulls an exasperated face
Thug2 steps in hungry for exercise

Thug2 starts to beat Nicholas up He has the powerful fluid
movements of a prize fighter He treats this as a workout

Thug1 looks outraged as if this is against union rules
Thug2 works Nicholas expertly and with professional care
URI
Alright alright thank you

Mister Karaczun This is

This is getting them nowhere Uri looks at Nicholas pulped
face at the new damage that Thug2 has done Pointless

Thug2 stands back waits

lays out the implements on a metal table beside Nicholas
He goes to work
493 INT ARTIST STUDIO DAY

ELLE (30s) draws a female nude in white pastel on black
paper The drawing is as exquisite as she is if thats
possible Elle is the kind of woman that men will do anything
for - the kind of unforgettable beauty you see very rarely

Elle takes extreme care with the drawing Her attention to it
and involvement with it is absolute She is alone in the
studio which contains other drawings and simple furnature

The SOUNDS of Uri torturing Nicholas OVER are in extreme
hideous contrast to the beauty of Elle and her drawings

The contours of Elles face and the fine lines and moments of
shade in her drawing The sounds of unimaginable suffering

Five minutes of drawing Five minutes of Nicholas screams

Then the SOUND of Uri dropping an implement and cursing

The Thugs mumbling

Uri sits at a huge polished oak business meeting table He is

Theres never a good time

SILK
Yes sir

Silk makes a note on his iPad
Boothy looks at Uri as if waiting for an explanation

URI
Our intelligence

The irony of that comment creates a response that emanates
from Boothy and travels round the table hierarchically

BOOTHY
As the board understood it the
prisoner was verified as the
jihadi There was DNA

URI
We now believe the evidenced

Was there any form of extraction

The oddness of that causes some rolled eyes around the table
Boothy studies the information on his laptop

therefore do the same Uri smartens his suit and shirt cuffs

URI
It was a fruitless interrogation
sir - yes

Boothy eventually looks up from his laptop

Boothy ignores

BOOTHY
So not only do we have no further

have another next of kin a
nuclear bloody winter of media
fallout and the inevitable

PARKER
Mission creep

It should be funny but somehow its sick

BOOTHY
What were here to establish is
how a freelance writer gets
wrongly arrested subjected to

tortured by experts in the

a terrorist planning acts

Elle listens to the caring sharing voice on the phone

collapses Theres a certain grace to the way she does it

Boothy reads from his laptop again then removes his glasses

BOOTHY
What were left with is
something of a mess Im sure
you agree

He looks at Uri and waits The others do the same

URI
Sorry sir I dont suppose we
could get some Im

Uri makes a thirsty gesture Mildly irritated Boothy presses
a button on an intercom It buzzes the other end then

inform you of the circumstances
under which your husband

seem so ordinary so dull and so average He drinks more JD

plate of digestives down on the table and leaves the room

She goes to the door Eventually she opens it

Uri stands there He smiles thinly extends a hand As she
takes it he looks at his hand This hand killed her love

ELLE

URI
No really Im fine Thank you

He has trouble meeting her eyes That unsettles her even more
URI
Such platitudes Here we are
trapped inside a Terrence
Rattigan three act

Wary of him in the extreme he gestures to a seat reluctantly
She sits down opposite him Her body language is pure defence
URI
Mrs Pentane A delicate subject

of course Your husband
She blinks He can see the unimaginable depth of her grief
Uri gets some correspondence out of his briefcase
URI
Good old fashioned paper
Nothing like it

He waves the sheets of paper around She cant even react

URI
Misses Pentane

attention A mother and her two sons They smile at her

She tries to smile closes the door slightly
Uri is almost hyperventilating by now

ELLE
You need to get the hell away
from me Sorry but

URI
Misses Pentane the fact is that
your husband was subjected to
rendition Not as you may have
heard of it but in a form

She has to lean against the wall

URI
Whilst in this instance your
husband wasnt transported
abroad because of logistics

ELLE
(a whisper)
Logistics

URI
He was subjected here in the
United Kingdom to a process
designed to get him to confess
4107 INT BOARD ROOM FACILITY - DAY
Uri feels his burnt tongue Boothy Silk and Parker observe

BOOTHY
What we need to establish Uri
is whether having found out

71 Page

(contd)
that you had made a mistake
you killed Nicholas Pentane
deliberately or whether his
death was merely a product of
of the processes to which he
was being subjected

URI
He was no longer any use By
that stage his body was his
mind He would never have
been able to lead an ordinary
life work have relationships

BOOTHY
So you did the judicious thing
and disposed of the suspect
accordingly

4108 INT ELLES APARTMENT DAY SAME TIME
Elle stands by the door She buckles He wants to help her
URI
Your husband was tortured
Misses Pentane
His voice has an unnatural edge to it It sounds weird

She starts to laugh hysterically Its all a joke Of course

URI
These are measures taken
occasionally and in conditions
of the utmost secrecy against
certain suspects accused of
terrorism Im sure youre aware

She stops laughing

She stares at him tries to form words
Her knees give out He goes to her helps her

ELLE
DONT TOUCH ME

She pushes him away in panic He recoils

Another text message bleeps ludicrously from her phone

URI
This isnt exactly what I came
here to tell you Misses
Not entirely

He seems to reach a critical mass Emotion leaves him

URI
What I came here to tell you
today that it was me I oversaw
the torture and tortured your
husband It was under my
ministrations

She is incredulous of the use of the word
URI
It was me you see I killed
him An accident Only so much
Her world has become a nightmare Nothing is real
URI
I know this is a lot to take
in Misses Pentane

The words dont seem like hers

ELLE

Uri almost smiles Little old me

As if in a dream she looks around searching for something
ELLE

other artefacts in a lit glass fronted display cabinet

Elle drops the stone statue again stumbles away

the deep shadows to conceal himself He scopes out the back of
the houses he walks past as if looking for an opportunity

A radio advert ends OVER

AD VO
snot that youll be needing
one now that your house
assurance is on the house Cheers

As the VO ends there is the sound of drinking glasses knocking
together in a busy pub then an inane radio ad jingle then

5113 INT RADIO STATION DJ BOOTH NIGHT

FEMALE DJ VO
So welcome back and if youve
just joined us welcome Im
talking to Chris Marlow the
barrister who represented
decorated Afghanistan para
veteran Shona Barnes earlier
this year If you recall Shona
was sentenced to seven years
in Wormwood Scrubs for the
murder of Caleb Rounds’ the
man who broke into her house
shot and held her hostage for
several hours on the night of
March the twelfth last year
Chris so in your
opinion Shonas Post-Traumatic
Stress Disorder a condition
she suffered following action
an incident with an IED in
Helmand Province in Afghanistan
in May two thousand and ten

77 Page
(contd)

an incident that killed a
close colleague of hers and
resulted in Shona being
pensioned invalided out of
the army In your opinion Chris
this - the PTSD - should have
been crucial to the decision
not to prosecute Shona for
murder a charge you now feel
should have been reduced to
what manslaughter She didnt
seem like much of an invalid
in the way she dealt with Rounds
did she So for you - was this
a travesty of justice Really

MARLOW VO
My sense of it is Christie
as Ive said and the reason I
feel I failed really is that
the state must find a way
to take responsibility

The hoodie climbs over the back fence of a house He then
proceeds up the garden again hugging the shadows for cover

FEMALE DJ VO
But now youre considering
retiring With a future as
QC certain A Law Lord perhaps
Youre regarded by many as a
(laughs) legal wunderkind

MARLOW VO
Well I dont know about that
But yes Im looking to move
out of the legal profession now

FEMALE DJ VO
Because of this case specifically
As Queens Council you could help
people like Shona Lots of Shonas

MARLOW
I know But look For me its
this we send her out to
Afghanistan We tell her to kill
people who resisted our invasion
(as the DJ starts to speak) But

78 Page
(contd)

anyway look we make her

an expert A killing machine

And then war breaks our machine

So then our machine needs
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
drugs in order to function in
normal life To make a cup of
tea for God sake (silence a
beat then) Shes a broken
child Chrissie We broke her
So then when she kills a known
psychotic child molester and
murderer in her home in the
middle of the night in her
home - in self-defence we
the state we call that murder
and we throw her to the dogs We
screw her up in the name of a
cause in some country some
people - and lets face it
in a part of the world not
many British people know or
give a damn about - and then we
finish the job We prosecute her
for murder and lock her up

The hoodie chooses a ground floor window He jemmies it open

FEMALE DJ VO
But ultimately the only
alternative is that we dont
have a professional a standing
army We rely on

MARLOW VO

I understand I understand
that when you sign up you
take your chances You become
an organ of the state and if
that state tells you to kill
people in its name it chooses
not to call that murder It
chooses then to call you a
hero especially if you die

FEMALE DJ VO
So these young people the
soldiers who give their lives
in the defence of our liberty

79 Page
(contd)
dont deserve the label hero
Is that what youre saying

The hoodie climbs through the window he has jemmied open

MARLOW VO
Nation states have always
protected themselves from their
own imperial absurdities What
would be left if there was no
chance of glory Why would anyone
sign up Look in war anywhere
people do what they can to
survive All I can say is that
personally I mean as Shonas
brief I failed to make the court
see sense For me you know its
like you can murder in the so
called defence of the state but
if you kill in the defence of
yourself You know its
like I mean as Shakespeare

manages to stand as Shona attacks him She moves fast and with
focus a shape in the darkness moving very fast Caleb lashes
out with his right fist He misses She lands another two
punches to his neck and face He yells and lashes out again
This time he connects with the side of her head She goes
sprawling He dives towards her and pounds her with his fists

CALEB
What the fuck easy-peasy ho

She fights him the focussed power of a trained soldier but
hes too strong and doesnt seem to feel blows that should be
causing him a lot of pain He PUNCHES her in the head twice

She goes still

Caleb now pulls the SILENCED GUN hes been trying to get his
hands on throughout the fight from his jacket pocket He
stands gasping for breath He aims the gun at her

As he goes to pull his pecker out she stands As if shes had
enough of the game she looks at him like a bug dead already

CALEB
Sit the fuck

Lightning fast she POUNDS her index and first fingers into
his EYES blinding him At the same time she snap PUNCHES his
THROAT collapsing his oesophagus completely In less than a
second Caleb goes from being in charge to being a grovelling
screaming piece of crap on the floor at her feet But now he
FIRES

His gun wildly up at her anywhere Succumbing to the drugs
she dodges as the bullets THUD into the walls and furnature

SHONA
Stop Please

She KICKS at his gun hand Its inaccurate because now the
drugs are overwhelming her He keeps hold of the gun
screaming and gasping for breath he will never draw again

A bullet SLAMS into the wall beside her Reluctantly she
Forces herself to FOCUS to hold the drugs back as she

92 Page
SMASHES

The back of his neck with the side of her fist A loud
CRACK
Caleb stops moving instantly DEAD
Shona stands there breathing hard trying to focus
And then slowly surely the tears come The drugs win
A radio ad OVER
AD vo 1
(male)
I should cocoa Betty
AD vO 2
(female)
Me too Bill Nighty-night

The sounds of polite kissing and an inane radio ad jingle as

Shona collapses As she loses consciousness BLACKNESS and
the SOUND of distant hallucinatory police SIRENS as we

DISSOLVE TO
5125 INT POLICE HOLDING CELL DAY
The radio ad jingle and bullshit fades to SILENCE as

A year later Shona sits looking at CAMERA She is handcuffed
Her face bears the scars Her eyes in ECU they are dark
damaged strong and sad She is searching for our affirmation

Slowly surely we
FADE TO BLACK
