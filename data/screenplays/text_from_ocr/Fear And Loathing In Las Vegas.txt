FEAR and LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS
by

Terry Gilliam and Toy Grisoni

BLACK SCREEN

A desert wind moans sadly From somewhere within the wind
comes the tinkly syrupy-sweet sounds of the Lennon Sisters
singing My Favorite Things A series of sepia images of
anti-war protests from the mid-sixties appear one after
another on the screen

In the violently scrawled style of Ralph Steadman the title
FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS splashes onto the screen A
beat and then it runs down and off revealing

TITLE He who makes a beast of himself
Gets rid of the pain
Of being a man
Dr Johnson

The VOICE OF HUNTER S THOMPSON -- aka RAOUL DUKE
DUKE (VO)
We were somewhere around Barstow on

the edge of the desert when the
drugs began to take hold

A red Chevy convertible -- THE RED SHARK -- wipes the black
screen

EXT ON THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY

THE RED SHARK races down the desert highway at a hundred
miles an hour THE STONES Sympathy For the Devil blares

AT THE WHEEL

STRANGELY STILL AND TENSE RAOUL DUKE DRIVES -- SKELETAL
BEER IN HAND -- STARES STRAIGHT AHEAD

BESIDE HIM FACE TURNED TO THE SUN EYES CLOSED BEHIND
WRAPAROUND SPANISH SUNGLASSES IS HIS SWARTHY AND UNNERVINGLY
UNPREDICTABLE ATTORNEY DR GONZO

The music pounds DUKE stares straight ahead GONZO froths
up a can of beer - uses it as shaving foam

DUKE (VO)
I remember saying something like
I feel a bit lightheaded Maybe
you should drive

GONZO starts shaving

DUKE (VO)
Suddenly there was a terrible roar
all around us and the sky was full
of what looked like huge bats all
swooping and screeching and diving
around the car

Close on DUKE -- shadows flutter across his face The
reflections of bats swirl within his eyes We push in close
to one eye ball -- SCREECHING SWIRLING BAT-LIKE SHAPES

DUKE (VO)
and a voice was screaming Holy
Jesus What are these goddamn
animals

CUT TO WIDE SHOT OF CAR -

DUKE eyes rigid flails at the air No bats anywhere
GONZO casually looks over

GONZO
What are you yelling about

DUCK SCREECHES to the side of the road The sudden wrench
makes GONZO nick his face with his razor

DUKE
Never mind Its your turn to drive

DUKE (VO)
No point mentioning these bats I
thought The poor bastard will see
them soon enough
DUKE hops out of the car keeping an eye out for bats
frantically opens the trunk to reveal what looks like A
MOBILE POLICE NARCOTICS LAB DUKE desperately rifles
through the impressive stash

DUKE (VO)
We had two bags of grass seventy-
five pellets of mescaline five
sheets of high powered blotter
acid a salt shaker half full of
cocaine a whole galaxy of multi-
colored uppers downers screamers
laughers Also a quart of tequila
a quart of rum a case of beer a
pint of raw ether and two dozen
amyls

DUKE eyes darting madly as he hears what sounds like the
SHRIEKS OF BATS returning grabs an assortment along with
another six-pack of beer - slams the trunk shut and dives
back into the car

DUKE (VO)
Not that we needed all that for the
trip but once you get locked into
a serious drug collection the
tendency is to push it as far as
you can

THE RED SHARK RACES INTO THE DISTANCE on the ground
weakly flapping is a SEMI-SQUASHED SLOWLY DYING ANIMAL A
BAT

EXT FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY
IN THE RED SHARK

GONZO grips the wheel - stares maniacally down the road - a
lousy driver

DUKE (VO)
The only thing that really worried
me was the ether There is nothing
in the world more helpless and
irresponsible and depraved than a
man in the depths of an ether binge
And I knew wed get into that
rotten stuff pretty soon
The radio news wars with SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL on a tape
recorder

RADIO NEWS
An overdose of heroin was listed as
the official cause of death for
pretty 19 year old Diane Hanby
whose body was found stuffed ina
refrigerator last week

GONZO changes the station - ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE SWEET
JESUS ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE vies with SYMPATHY He
sings along - washes a couple of pills back with a new beer
The RED SHARK fishtails

GONZO
One toke over the line sweet
Jesus

DUKE

(muttering to himself)
One toke You poor fool Wait
till you see those goddamn bats

UP AHEAD - AT THE SIDE OF THE DESERTED ROAD

A LONE HITCHHIKER spots them jumps up and sticks out a
thumb The RED SHARK roars past Then fifty yards down
the road

GONZO
Lets give that boy a lift

GONZO wrenches the wheel - THE RED SHARK swerves to the side
of the road

DUKE
We cant stop here - this is bat
country

GONZO JAMS THE CAR INTO REVERSE AND ROCKETS BACKWARDS The
HITCHHIKER races to the car A poor OKIE KID with a big grin

HITCHHIKER
Hot damn I never rode ina
convertible before

Then the big grin freezes on the OKIE KIDs face at the
sight of DUKE and GONZO looking out at him with HYPER-
NORMAL shit-eating SMILES
DUKE
Is that right Well I guess

youre about ready eh

The HITCHHIKER hesitates

GONZO
Were your friends Were not like
the others

DUKE

(hissing sharply)
No more of that talk or Ill put
the leeches on you

DUKE turns back to the HITCHHIKER - smiles reassuringly
EXT EVEN FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY

The HITCHHIKER sits nervously in the back seat as the RED
SHARK screams down the road

GONZO sings along to the tape player

The HITCHHIKERs eyes go to the door - considers jumping out
and taking his chances

DUKE sweating bullets STARES AT THE HITCHHIKER in the rear
view mirror

DUKE (VO)
How long could we maintain I
wondered How long before one of
us starts raving and jabbering at
this boy What will he think then
This same lonely desert was the
last known home of the Manson family

The HITCHHIKERs eyes notice a thin line of blood trickling
down GONZOs neck

DUKE (VO)
Would he make that grim connection
when my attorney starts screaming
about bats and huge manta rays
coming down on the car
DUKEs mouth moves intermittently - sometimes in sync with
the words sometimes not

DUKE (VO)
If so - well well just have to
cut his head off and bury him
somewhere Because it goes without
saying that we cant turn him loose
Hed report us at once to some kind
of outback Nazi law enforcement
agency and theyll run us down
like dogs

DUKE
(out loud to himself)
Jesus Did I say that

DUKE (V0)
Or just think it Was I talking
Did they hear me

GONZO
(reassuringly to HITCHHIKER)
Its okay Hes admiring the shape
of your skull

DUKE gives the HITCHHIKER a FINE BIG GRIN and the HITCHHIKER
giggles nervously

DUKE (VO)
Maybe I better have a chat with
this boy I thought Perhaps if I
explain things hell rest easy

DUKE
(roaring over the
road noise)
THERES ONE THING YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY UNDERSTAND --

The HITCHHIKER stares at him not blinking
DUKE
(yells)
CAN YOU HEAR ME

The HITCHHIKER nods -- giggles -- terrified DUKE climbs
into the back seat
DUKE

Thats good Because I want you to
have all the background This is a
very ominous assignment -- with
overtones of extreme personal
danger Im a Doctor of Journalism
This is important goddamnit This
is a true story

(WHACKS the BACK OF

THE DRIVERS SEAT

with his fist)

The CAR SWERVES SICKENINGLY then straightens out

GONZO
(screams )
Keep your hands off my fucking neck

The HITCHHIKER makes a sudden lunge for freedom DUKE GRABS
HIM BACK DOWN

DUKE (VO)
Our vibrations were getting nasty --
but why Was there no communication
in this car Had we deteriorated
to the level of dumb beasts

The HITCHHIKER STRUGGLES IN PANIC

DUKE

(to HITCHHIKER)
I want you to understand that this
man at the wheel is my attorney
Hes not just some dingbat I found
on the Strip Hes a foreigner I
think hes probably Samoan But it
doesnt matter does it Are you
prejudiced

HITCHHIKER
Hell no

DUKE
I didnt think so Because in
spite of his race this man is
extremely valuable to me Hell I
forgot all about this beer You
want one
(HITCHHIKER shakes
his head)
How about some ether

HITCHHIKER
What

DUKE
Never mind Lets get right to the
heart of this thing Twenty-four
hours ago we were sitting in the
Pogo Lounge of the Beverly Wills
Hotel

INT THE BEVERLY WILLS HOTEL POGO LOUNGE 1971 - DAY

A uniformed DWARF carries a shockingly PINK TELEPHONE
through the glittering tranquil POGO LOUNGE CROWD They
are the ELOI HENDRIX AFROS and DROOPING MUSTACHES and BELL
BOTTOMS and LOVE BEADS and BELLS ACTRESSES sip Singapore
Slings and PROMOTERS sip ACTRESSES in this MONIED SANITISED
VERSION OF THE GREAT REVOLUTION YEARS

DUKE (VO)
in the patio section of
course drinking Singapore Slings
with mescal on the side hiding
from the brutish realities of this
foul year of Our Lord 1971

The DWARF reaches DUKE -- T-shirt levis sneakers and
shades GONZO -- white rayon bellbottoms and a khaki tank
top undershirt They are in the middle of a serious
conversation

DUKE
Im telling you the Salazar story
is getting too complicated The
weasels have started closing in

The DWARF sneers

DWARF
Perhaps this is the call youve
been waiting for all this time
sir

DUKE lifts the receiver -- listens
DUKE
Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh

DUKE hangs up the PHONE with the DEAD-PAN EXPRESSION OF A
MOVIE SPY

DWARF
That was headquarters They want
me to go to Las Vegas at once and
make contact with a Portuguese
photographer named Lacerda Hell
have the details All I have to do
is check into my sound proof suite
and hell seek me out

GONZO says nothing for a moment then POUNDS the table

GONZO

God hell I think I see the
pattern This one sounds like real
trouble Youre going to need
plenty of legal advice before this
thing is over As your attorney I
must advise you that youll need a
very fast car with no top and after
that the cocaine And then the
tape recorder for special music
and some Acapulco shirts

(GONZO tucks his

khaki undershirt into

his white

bellbottoms -- he

means business)
This blows my weekend because
naturally Ill have to go with
you -- and well have to arm
ourselves

DUKE
Why not If a things worth doing
its worth doing right

DUKE and GONZO are up and off The DWARF chases after them
with the (very large) check in his hand

They sweep out through the Lounge door unaware of it
swinging back into the face of the pursuing DWARF

DUKE
I tell you my man This is the
American Dream in action Wed be
fools not to ride this strange
torpedo all the way to the end

GONZO
Indeed We must do it What kind
of story is this

EXT BEVERLY WILLS HOTEL - FRONT ENTRANCE - DAY
DUKE and GONZO emerge

DUKE

The Mint 400 The richest off-road
race for motorcycles and dune-
buggies in the history of organized
sport

(handing parking

ticket to Valet)
-- a fantastic spectacle in honor
of some fatback grossero who owns
the luxurious Mint Hotel in the
heart of downtown Vegas at least
thats what the press release says

Their car arrives -- rusted out smashed door panels They
jump in
DUKE
Were going to have to drum it up
on our own Pure Gonzo Journalism

And theyre off in a cloud of black exhaust as the nose-
bleeding DWARF stumbles out with the unpaid bill in his hand

EXT SUNSET BLVD - DAY
The PINTO races through shot
DUKE (V0)
Getting hold of the drugs and

shirts had been no problem

EXT POLYNESIAN BAR - DAY

The PINTO skids to a halt outside Polynesian bar the back

DUKE (VO CONTD)
but the car and tape recorder
were not easy things to round up at
630 on a Friday afternoon in
Hollywood

INT POLYNESIAN BAR - DAY

TORN YELLOW PAGES with dealers ads ticked off lie in a pile
as GONZO yells into a PAYPHONE DUKE carries over four
Singapore Slings

GONZO

OK OK yes Hang onto it

(to DUKE -- hand over

the PHONE)
I finally located a car with
adequate horsepower and the proper
coloring

(into PHONE)
What OF COURSE the gentleman has
a major credit card Do you
realize who the fuck youre talking

to

DUKE
Dont take any guff from these
swine

(GONZO slams the

phone down)
Now we need a sound store with the
finest equipment Nothing dinky
One of those new Belgian Heliowatts
with a voice-activated shotgun
mike for picking up conversations
in oncoming cars

GONZO
We wont make the nut unless we
have unlimited credit

DUKE
We will You Samoans are all the
same You have no faith in the
essential decency of the white
mans culture

EXT SUNSET BLVD - DUSK
The PINTO races down street

DUKE (VO)
The store was closed but the
salesman said he would wait if we
hurried

EXT SUNSET BLVD - TRAFFIC JAM - DUSK

Directly in front of them BLOODY CARNAGE -- a covered
corpse is loaded into an ambulance by PARAMEDICS

EXT CAR RENTAL AGENCY - NIGHT

DUKE (V0)
We had trouble again at the car
rental agency

Behind the wheel of the RED SHARK DUKE grins with
satisfaction -- checking it out A nervous AGENT holds out
a clipboard DUKE signs without looking at the rental papers

AGENT
Say uh you fellas are going
to be careful with this car arent
you

DUKE
Of course

DUKE throws the car into reverse -- roars backwards past the
gas pumps to where GONZO is unloading their rusted out car

AGENT
Well good god You just backed
over that two foot concrete abutment
and you didnt even slow down
Forty-five in reverse And you
barely missed the pump

DUKE
No harm done I always test the
transmission that way The rear
end For stress factors

GONZO transfers boxes of new sound equipment and a large box
of rum and ice into the RED SHARK

AGENT
Say Are you fellows drinking

DUKE
Not me Were responsible people

He JAMS the car into LOW GEAR and lurches into traffic The
AGENT runs into the street and helplessly watches them go

GONZO
Theres another worrier Hes
probably all cranked up on speed

EXT RUNDOWN BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT

STRANGE AND MAGICAL In the moonlight the silhouetted
figures of DUKE and GONZO as they pack the RED SHARK

DUKE (VO)
We spent the rest of that night
rounding up materials and packing
the car Then we ate some mescaline
and went swimming

The surf crashes in the distance
EXT PACIFIC OCEAN - NIGHT

DUKE cries out as he dives into the ocean He lets himself
float up through the silvery bubbles

DUKE AND GONZO FLOAT BEATIFICALLY IN THE GLOWING SHIMMERING
MOONLIT SURF

DUKE (VO)
Our trip was different It was to
be a classic affirmation of
everything right and true in the
national character a gross
physical salute to the fantastic
possibilities of life in this
country But only for those with
true grit
EXT AND EVEN FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY

He said he understood but I could
see in his eyes that he didnt He
was lying to me

GONZO
My heart

GONZO clutches his heart The car veers off the road and

screeches to a halt He slumps over the wheel

GONZO (CONTD)
Wheres the medicine

DUKE

out into the cloud of dust
EXT DESERT - DAY
Nothing Except for a THICK CLOUD OF DUST

Barely visible a motorcycle comes speeding into the pits
The RIDER staggers off his bike The PIT CREW gas it up and
sends it back with a FRESH RIDER

DUKE watches him disappear back into the dust cloud

DUKE (V0)
By 10 they were spread out all over
the course It was no longer a
race now it was an Endurance
Contest The idea of trying to
cover this race in any
conventional press sense was absurd

A HORN HONKS A shiny BLACK BRONCO with DRIVER LACERDA
hangs out of the window

LACERDA
Its great isnt it Jump in

DUKE gets into the Bronco and they head into the DUST CLOUD
EXT DESERT - DAY
IN THE BRONCO

DUKE hangs on with his beer Nothing all around but the
HUGE IMPENETRABLE CLOUD OF DUST LACERDA snaps madly away
at nothing at all

LACERDA
Ill just keep trying different
combos of film and lenses till I
find one that works in this dust

The SOUND OF MOTORCYCLES RACING
We hear music and voices singing

BATTLE HYMN
As we go marching on
When I reach my final campground
in
that land beyond the sun
And the Great Commander asks me
What did he ask you Rusty
Did you fight or did you run

A moment later the Bronco races out of the dust DUKE
coughs chokes drinks beer

BATTLE HYMN
(continuing)
And what did you tell them
Rusty
We responded to their rifle fire
with everything we had

The sound of gun shots
A DUNE BUGGY races toward them loaded down with THREE

RETIRED PETTY OFFICERS DRUNK AS HELL The radio blares
THE BATTLE HYMN OF LIEUTENANT CALLEY
The dune buggy is COVERED WITH OMINOUS SYMBOLS SCREAMING
EAGLES CARRYING AMERICAN FLAGS IN THEIR CLAWS A slant-eyed
Snake being chopped to bits by a buzz-saw made of stars and
stripes A MACHINE GUN MOUNT on the passenger side They
yell over the roaring engines

DUNE BUGGY DRIVER
Wheres the damn race

DUKE
Beats me Were just good patriotic
Americans like yourself

DUKE gives DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER 2 A NICE BIG GRIN In
response the PASSENGER 2 narrows his eyes -- tightens his
grip on an automatic weapon

DUNE BUGGY DRIVER
(suspiciously)
What outfit you fellas with

DUKE
The sporting press Were
friendlies Hired geeks

The DRIVER and DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER 2 exchange looks

DUKE
If you want a good chase you
should get after that skunk from
CBS News up ahead in the black jeep
Hes the man responsible for that
book THE SELLING OF THE PENTAGON

DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER 1
HOT DAMN

DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER 2
A black jeep you say

LACERDA

DUKE gets out of the Bronco

DUKE

Youre fired

After a moments hesitation

roar away leaving

DUKE alone in the cloud of dust

Agonizing Reappraisal of the whole

Are you ready

He switches WHITE RABBIT back on GONZO HOWLS AND MOANS
AND THRASHES TO THE MUSIC straining to get over the top

Meanwhile DUKE picks up a grapefruit from the sink -- a
good two-pounder he gets a grip on it and when WHITE
RABBIT peaks HE HURLS IT INTO THE TUB LIKE A CANNONBALL

GONZO SCREAMS CRAZILY THRASHING AND CHURNING -- CAUSING A

GONZO shuffles back into the bathroom DUKE wedges a chair
up against the bathroom doorknob and puts the mace can next
to the clock

DUKE turns on the TV WHITE NOISE FILLS THE ROOM He
collapses onto the sofa and lights up his lightbulb as pipe

Ignore the nightmare in the bathroom
Just another ugly refugee from the
Love Generation

The WHITE NOISE snow storm on the TV is reflected in his
face The camera pulls back revealing THE ENTIRE WALL
BEHIND HIM TO BE SWIRLING WITH THE FIZZING SNOWSTORM PATTERN

DUKE (V0)
My attorney had never been able to
accept the notion -- often espoused
by former drug abusers -- that you
can get a lot higher without drugs
than with them And neither have
I for that matter

The pattern on the wall changes to A 60S VISCOUS OIL

A ROAD-PERSON with a big pack on his back is shouting The

Good thinking But I spilled the
rest on the sleeve of my red
Pendleton shirt

DUKE stares at his sleeve uncertain what to do CU of the
door to the mens room as a MUSICIAN enters speaking in
slow-motion

MUSICIAN
Whats the trouble

DUKE
(also in slow-motion)
Well all this white stuff on my
sleeve is LSD

The MUSICIAN approaches and looks down at DUKES arm A
long pause

Cut back to tight shot of door as it opens and a very clean-
cut PREPPY STOCKBROKER TYPE enters He freezes in horror
We cut to his POV DUKE is standing in the middle of the
mens room with the MUSICIAN hunkered down at his side
sucking on his sleeve A very gross tableau The
STOCKBROKER slowly eases out of the room

DUKE (V0)
With a bit of luck his life was
ruined -- forever thinking that

just behind some narrow door in all
his favorite bars men in red
Pendleton shirts are getting
incredible kicks from things hell
never know

INT A BAR - YEARS LATER - NIGHT

The STOCKBROKER LOOKING CONSIDERABLY OLDER sits looking
lost confused a nervous wreck The image flares out ina
TV white noise snowstorm

INT MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE sits staring at the TV

DUKE (VO)

Strange memories on this nervous
night in Las Vegas

(he gets up pours

himself a drink)
Has it been five years Six It
seems like a lifetime -- the kind
of peak that never comes again
San Francisco in the middle sixties
was a very special time and place
to be a part of But no
explanation no mix of words or
music or memories can touch that
sense of knowing that you were
there and alive in that corner of
time and the world Whatever it
meant

DUKE throws open the curtains Light streams in
EXT 1965 STOCK FOOTAGE
We are in SAN FRANCISCO IMAGES OF THE TIME FLOOD IN

DUKE (VO)
THERE WAS MADNESS IN ANY DIRECTION
AT ANY HOUR YOU COULD STRIKE
SPARKS ANYWHERE THERE WAS A
FANTASTIC UNIVERSAL SENSE THAT
WHATEVER WE WERE DOING WAS RIGHT
THAT WE WERE WINNING AND THAT I
THINK WAS THE HANDLE -- THAT SENSE
OF INEVITABLE VICTORY OVER THE
FORCES OF OLD AND EVIL NOT IN ANY
MEAN OR MILITARY SENSE WE DIDNT
NEED THAT OUR ENERGY WOULD SIMPLY
prevail We had all the momentum
we were riding the crest of a high
and beautiful wave

DUKES FACE IS SUFFUSED WITH A SADNESS AND SERENITY WE HAVE
NEVER SEEN BEFORE

DUKE (VO)
So now less than five years later
you can go up on a steep hill in
Las Vegas and look west and with
the right kind of eyes you can
almost see the high water mark --
that place where the wave finally
broke and rolled back

The memories dissolve into the night skyline of Vegas
Suddenly towering over the casinos is a 200 foot high Nazi
shouting WOODSTOCK UBER ALLES

INT MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE closes the curtain The room is in darkness again

INT MINT HOTEL SUITE - DAWN

A harsh door buzzer DUKE jerks awake Alone Looking
like shit Around him is the wreckage of their stay

DUKE (V0)
The decision to flee came suddenly
Or maybe not

DUKE opens the door to a BELL BOY with a trolley load of
fruit drinks and flowers and a smile

BELL BOY
Room service

The BELL BOY wheels the trolley across the room -- already
stacked with EVEN MORE BOXES OF GOODIES

DUKE (VO)
Maybe Id planned it all along --
subconsciously waiting for the
right moment The bill was a
factor I think Because had no
money to pay for it

DUKE slams the door -- starts FRANTICALLY PACKING

DUKE (V0)
Our room service tabs had been
running somewhere between 29 and
36 per hour for forty-eight

consecutive hours Incredible
How could it happen

DUKE sees the DISCARDED WRAPPINGS OF EXPENSIVE HAND TOOLED
LUGGAGE A sudden thought He rushes to GONZOs room --
empty His plastic briefcase remains on the bed

DUKE (VO)
But by the time I asked this
question there was no one around
to answer

DUKE opens the briefcase -- finds the 357 MAGNUM inside

DUKE (V0)
My attorney was gone He must have
sensed trouble

Panic

INT CORRIDOR OUTSIDE HOTEL SUITE - DAY

DUKE emerges with his bag and Gonzos plastic briefcase --
leaves the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door -- checks both
ways then hurries away down the corridor

DUKE (V0)
It crept up my spine like first
rising vibes of an acid frenzy
All these horrible realities began
to dawn on me

INT MINT HOTEL ELEVATOR - DAY

An anxiety ridden DUKE watches the floor numbers as the
elevator descends He searches his pockets

DUKE (V0)
Here I was alone in Las Vegas
with this goddamned incredibly
expensive car completely twisted
on drugs no cash no story for the
magazine And on top of everything
else I had a gigantic goddamn hotel
bill to deal with

DUKE finds a last crumpled 5 bill

The door opens A SECURITY GUARD enters with an OLD LADY IN
HANDCUFFS

DUKE hides the bill -- crams back into the corner Doors
close

DUKE (V0)
I didnt even know who had won the
race Maybe nobody

INT MINT HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

DUKE hurries out of the elevator -- eyes on a hovering
MANAGER Past the curious look of the reception CLERK

DUKE
(muttering to himself)
How would Horatio Alger have
handled this situation

EXT MINT HOTEL - DAY
Motoring DUKE gives his 5 bill to the HOTEL FRONT DOORMAN

with a smile The DOORMAN blows a frantic whistle and waves
at the CAR BOY

DUKE (V0)
Stay calm Stay calm Ima
relatively respectable citizen -- a

multiple felon perhaps but
certainly not dangerous

The CAR BOY pulls up with a screech DUKE jumps in The
back seat is stacked with bars of Neutrogena piles of Mint
400 t-shirts boxes of grapefruit

DUKE (VO CONTD)
Luckily I had taken the soap and
grapefruit and other luggage out to
the car a few hours earlier Now
it was only a matter of slipping
the noose
DUKE shifts into drive Deliverance

DUKE freezes

CLERKS VOICE

Mr Duke Weve been looking for

you

DUKE (VO)
The game was up They had me

DUKE
(to himself)

Well why not Many fine books

have been written in prison

Resigned DUKE turns off the ignition A young CLERK

arrives breathlessly with a smile and a YELLOW LETTER IN HIS

HAND

CLERK
Sir
(thrusts out a TELEGRAM)
This telegram came for you

Actually it isnt for you Its
for somebody named Thompson but it
says care of Raoul Duke does

that make sense

DUKE
(barely able to speak)
Yes It makes sense

DUKE stuffs the telegram into his top pocket

The CLERK peers into the car -- sees part of the enormous

stash inside

CLERK

I checked the register for this man
Thompson We dont show him but I
figured he might be part of your

team

DUKE
He is Dont worry Ill get it to
him

He fires up the engine -- eases the RED SHARK into low gear

SECURITY GUARDS are looking across -- sharing a quiet word
or two

CLERK
What confused us was Dr Gonzos
signature on the telegram from Los
Angeles When we knew he was right
here in the hotel

DUKE
You did the right thing Never try
to understand a press message
About half the time we use codes --
especially with Dr Gonzo

CLERK
Tell me When will the doctor be
awake

DUKE
(tenses)
Awake What do you mean

DUKEs eyes are on the SECURITY GUARDS -- moving closer

CLERK
(uncomfortably)

Well the manager Mr Heem
would like to meet him Nothing
unusual Mr Heem likes to meet
all our large accounts put them
on a personal basis just a chat
and a handshake you understand

DUKE
Of course But if I were you Id
leave the Doctor alone until after
hes eaten breakfast Hes a very
crude man

DUKE edges the car forward but is stopped by the CLERK

CLERK
But he will be available Perhaps
later this morning

DUKE
Look That telegram was all
scrambled It was actually from
Thompson not to him Western
Union must have gotten the names
reversed I have to get going I
have to get out to the track

CLERK
Theres no hurry The race is over

DUKE
(taking off)
Not for me
He waves the CLERK off the car -- roars away
CLERK

The COP relaxes -- actually smiles He reaches out for
DUKEs wallet then holds out his other hand for the beer

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Could I have that please

DUKE
Why not It was getting warm anyway

The HIGHWAY PATROLMAN takes it pours out the beer --
glances in the back seat of the RED SHARK Amongst the bars
of soap A case of warm beer DUKE smiles back at him

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
You realize
He looks at

The HIGHWAY

DUKE
Yeah I know Im guilty I
understand that I knew it was a
crime but I did it anyway Shit

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Thats a strange attitude

DUKE thoughtfully

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
You know -- I get the feeling you

area up ahead Why dont you pull
over and sleep a few hours

DUKE
A nap wont help Ive been awake
for too long -- three or four
nights I cant even remember If

I go to sleep now Im dead for
twenty hours

PATROLMAN smiles

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Okay Heres how it is What goes
into my book as of noon is that I
apprehended you for driving too
fast and advised you to proceed no
further than the next rest area
your stated destination right
Where you plan to take a long nap
Do I make myself clear

DUKE
How far is Baker I was hoping to
stop there for lunch

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN

in the notion of running a savage
burn on one Las Vegas hotel and
then just wheeling across town and
checking into another

LUCY eyes DUKE venomously

GONZO

LUCY keeps her eyes on DUKE GONZO idles over and puts his
arm round her shoulder

GONZO
Lucy this is my client This is
Mr Duke the famous journalist
Hes paying for this suite Lucy
Hes on our side

DUKE flops onto the sofa

GONZO
Mr Duke is my friend He loves
artists

DUKE notices for the first time that the room is full of
artwork Maybe 40 or 50 portraits some in oil some in
charcoal all more or less the same size and same face

GONZO
Lucy paints portraits of Barbra
Streisand

LUCY

I drew these from TV

GONZO
Fantastic She came all the way
down here from Montana just to give
these portraits to Barbra Were
going over to the Americana Hotel

(struggling to focus)
Shit I met her on the plane and I
had all that acid

(he shrugs)
You know those little blue barrels
I gave her a cap before I realized
shes a religious freak Jesus
shes never even had a drink

DUKE
Well Itll probably work out
We can keep her loaded and peddle
her ass at the drug convention

GONZO stares uneasily at DUKE

GONZO
Listen shes running away from
home for something like the fifth
time in six months Its terrible

DUKE
Shes perfect for this gig These
cops will go fifty bucks a head to
beat her into submission and then
gang fuck her We can set her up
in one of these back street motels
hang pictures of Jesus all over the
room then turn these pigs loose on
her Hell shes strong shell
hold her own

GONZOs face twitches badly

GONZO
Jesus Christ I knew you were sick
but I never expected to hear you
actually say that kind of stuff

DUKE
Its straight economics This girl
is a god-send Shit she can make
us a grand a day

GONZO
NO Stop talking like that

DUKE
I figure she can do about four at a
time Christ if we keep her full
of acid thats more like two grand
a day Maybe three

GONZO
You filthy bastard I should cave
your fucking head in

DUKE
In a few hours shell probably be
sane enough to work herself into a
towering Jesus-based rage at the
hazy recollection of being seduced
by some kind of cruel Samoan who
fed her liquor and LSD dragged her
to a Vegas hotel room and savagely
penetrated every orifice in her
body with his throbbing
uncircumcised member

GONZO starts crying

GONZO

NO I felt sorry for the girl I
wanted to help her

DUKE
Youll go straight to the gas
chamber And even if you manage to
beat that theyll send you back to
Nevada for Rape and Consensual
Sodomy Shes got to go

Pause

GONZO
Shit it doesnt pay to try to help
somebody these days

A silence

DUKE (VO)
The only alternative was to take
her out to the desert and feed her
remains to the lizards But it
seemed a bit heavy for the thing we

were trying to protect My attorney

GONZO
We have to cut her loose Shes
got two hundred dollars And we
can always call the cops up there
in Montana where she lives and
turn her in

monster are you

has no witnesses Anything that
she says about us is completely
worthless

ever cool He is not with it
that is he doesnt know whats

figure it out he moves up a notch
to hip

reason with every weapon at his
command -- including yours

Sorry sick Beg pardon Feeling

BEWARE Any officer apprehending a
suspected marijuana addict should
use all necessary force immediately
One stitch in time on him will
usually save nine on you

DUKE CRASHES OUT THROUGH THE DOOR
INT CASINO BAR - DAY

DUKE sees GONZO at the bar -- talking to a SPORTY LOOKING
COP about 40 whose name tag identifies him as a DISTRICT
ATTORNEY FROM GEORGIA

DA
Im a whiskey man myself We dont
have much trouble from drugs where
I come from
GONZO
You will One of these nights
youll wake up and find a junkie
tearing your bedroom apart

DA
Naw

GONZO
Theyll climb right into your
bedroom and sit on your chest with
big Bowie knives They might even
sit on your wifes chest Put the
blade right down on her throat

DA
Not down in my parts

DUKE joins them

DUKE
(to WAITRESS)
Rum and ice please

DA
(looks at DUKES NAME TAG)
Youre another one of these

California boys Your friend
heres been tellin us about dope
fiends

DUKE

Theyre everywhere Nobodys safe
And sure as hell not in the South
They like warm weather Youd
never believe it In LA its out
of control First it was drugs
now its witchcraft

DA
Witchcraft Shit you cant mean it

The BARTENDER cleans his glasses one ear straining for the
conversation

GONZO
Read the newspapers

DUKE
Man you dont know trouble until
you have to face down a bunch of
these addicts gone crazy for human
sacrifice

DA
Naw Thats science fiction stuff

DUKE
Not where we operate

GONZO
Hell in Malibu alone these
goddamn Satan worshippers kill six
or eight people every day All
they want is the blood Theyll
take people right off the street if
they have to

DUKE
Just the other day we had a case
where they grabbed a girl right out
of a McDonalds hamburger stand
She was a waitress about sixteen
years old with a lot of people
watching too

The BARTENDER keeps cleaning the same glass -- more and more

furiously

DA
What happened What did they do to
her

GONZO
Do Jesus Christ man They
chopped her goddamn head off right
there in the parking lot Then
they cut all kinds of holes in her
head and sucked out the blood

DA
(DA ad-libs a
summation of the crime)
And nobody did anything

DUKE
What could they do The guy that
took the head was about six-seven
and maybe three-hundred pounds He
was packing two Lugers and the
others had M-16s

GONZO
They just ran back out into Death
Valley -- you know where Manson
turned up

DUKE

Like big lizards

GONZO
» and every one of them stacked
naked

DA
Naked

DUKE
Naked

GONZO
Yeh naked except for the
weapons

DUKE

They were all veterans

DA

Agog with the horrors of the story the BARTENDER polishes
the glass -- faster and faster

GONZO
Yeh The big guy used to be a
major in the Marines

DA
A major

GONZO
We know where he lives but we
cant get near the house

DA
Naw Not a major
GONZO
He wanted the pineal gland

DA
Really

GONZO
Thats how he got so big When he
quit the Marines he was just a
little guy

DUKE
Usually its whole families
During the night Most of them
dont even wake up until they feel
their heads going -- and then of
course its too late

The glass smashes in the BARTENDERs hand

DUKE (CONTD)
Happens every day

DUKE turns to a WAITRESS with a warm smile

DUKE (CONTD)
Three more rums Plenty of ice
Maybe a handful of lime chunks

WAITRESS
Are you guys with the police
convention upstairs

DA
We sure are Miss

WAITRESS
I thought so I never heard that
kind of talk around here before
Jesus Christ How do you guys
stand that kind of work

GONZO
(grinning)
We like it Its groovy
The WAITRESS stares -- sickened -- at GONZO

DUKE
Whats wrong with you Hell
somebody has to do it

GONZO
Hurry up with those drinks Were
thirsty Only two rums Make mine
a Bloody Mary

DA

(whacks his fist on

the bar)
Hell I really hate to hear this
Because everything that happens in
California seems to get down our
way sooner or later Mostly
Atlanta But that was back when
the goddamn bastards were peaceful
All we had to do was to keep em
under surveillance They didnt
roam around much But now Jesus
it seems nobodys safe

GONZO
(with a conspiratorial
nod)
Youre going to need to take the
bull by the horns -- go to the mat

with this scum

DA
What do you mean by that

GONZO
You know what I mean Weve done
it before and we can damn well do
it again

DUKE
Cut their goddamn heads off Every
one of them Thats what were
doing in California

DA
(stupefied)
WHAT

GONZO
Sure Its all on the QT but
everybody who matters is with us

all the way down the line

DUKE
We keep it quiet Its not the
kind of thing youd want to talk
about upstairs Not with the press
around

DA
(recovering slightly)
Hell no Wed never hear the
goddamn end of it

DUKE
Dobermans dont talk

DA
What

GONZO
Sometimes its easier to just rip
out the backstraps

DUKE
Theyll fight like hell if you try
to take the head without the dogs

DA
God almighty
(muttering in a daze)
I dont think I should tell my wife
about this Shed never understand
You know how women are

DUKE gives the DA a brotherly slap on the back
DUKE
Just be thankful your heart is

young and strong

DUKE and GONZO leave the stunned DA -- staring into the
swirling ice in drink

INT HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - DAY
DUKE and GONZO fall into the suite in fits of laughter

DUKE
(slowly carefully)
Lucy is looking for you

GONZO
(laughing)
No shes looking for you

DUKE

GONZO

only way I could get rid of her was
by saying you were taking me out to
the desert for a showdown -- that
you wanted me out of the way so you
could have her all to yourself

(laughing again)
I guess she figures you won That
phone message wasnt for me was it

A look of stunned realization from DUKE

bottle in my shaving kit

DUKE goes in the bathroom He finds a little bottle -- a
label DRINK ME

hash pipe)
Wheres the opium

DUKE stares at the back of GONZOs neck SOMETHING VERY
STRANGE IS HAPPENING TO HIM

DUKE (V0)

I remember slumping on the bed his
performance had given me a bad jolt
For a moment I thought his mind had
snapped -- that he actually believed
he was being attacked by invisible
enemies But the room was quiet
again

DUKE CLUTCHES THE BROWN BOTTLE

DUKE
Whered you get this

GONZO
Never mind its absolutely pure

DUKE
Jesus what kind of monster
client have you picked up this time
Theres only one source for this
stuff -- the adrenaline gland from
a living human body

GONZO turns to smile at DUKE

GONZO

I know but the guy didnt have any
cash to pay me Hes one of these
Satanism freaks He offered me
human blood -- said it would take
me higher than Ive ever been in my
life

(laughs -- struts

round DUKE -- eyes

bright with expectation)
I thought he was kidding so I told
him Id just as soon have an ounce
or so of pure adrenochrome -- or
maybe just a fresh adrenaline gland
to chew on

DUKE (V0)
I could already feel the stuff
working on me -- the first wave
felt like a combination of mescaline
and methedrine -- maybe I should
take a swim I thought

DUKE sees that GONZO is TOYING WITH HIS HUNTING KNIFE

GONZO
Yeah they nailed this guy for
child molesting He swore he
didnt do it Why should I fuck
with children he says Theyre
too small Christ werewolf is
entitled to legal counsel I
didnt dare turn the creep down
He might have picked up a letter
opener and gone after my pineal
gland

GONZO JABS WITH THE RAZOR BRIGHT KNIFE DUKES BODY IS
GOING RIGID -- HE SPEAKS THROUGH GRITTED TEETH

DUKE
Why not We should get some of
that Just eat a big handful and
see what happens

GONZO
Some of what

DUKE
(spitting words)
Extract of pineal

GONZO
(STARING AT DUKE WITH
A STRANGE SMILE)

whiff of that shit would turn you
into something out of a goddamn
medical encyclopedia

GONZO GROWS HORNS -- HIS FACE BECOMES A MEXICAN DEMON MASK

about a hundred pounds in two
hours

GONZOS VOICE FADES AWAY -- DUKES frenzied gaze reveals
GONZO REVERTED TO NORMAL HUMAN SHAPE AND SIZE

GONZO
Man Ill try about anything but
Id never touch a pineal gland

DUKE
FINISH THE FUCKING STORY What
happened What about the glands

GONZO a small smile on his lips backs away warily
towards the TV -- NOW A HUNDRED FEET AWAY IN THE DISTANCE

GONZO
Jesus that stuff got right on top
of you didnt it

VEINS stand out on DUKEs forehead He is purplish-red
OVER THE TOP Too late he realizes he is NEAR DEATH

DUKE
Maybe you could just shove me
into the pool or something

GONZO shakes his head disgustedly

GONZO
If I put you in the pool right now
youd sink like a goddamn stone
You took too much Jesus look at
your face youre about to explode

GONZO sits back down watching the TV

GONZO
Dont try and fight it or youll
get brain bubbles Strokes

and die

INT FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

Darkness Insanely somewhere NILSSON plays -- Put the
lime in the coconut and mix em all up

DUKE (VO)
What kind of rat-bastard psychotic
would play that song -- right now

at this moment

DUKE opens his eyes and the hotel suite rushes in He lies
awkwardly twisted -- unable to move He could have been
there days -- months

DUKE (VO)
When I came to the general back
alley ambiance of the suite was so
rotten so incredibly foul How
long had I been lying there Hours
Days Months All these signs of
violence What had happened

DUKE moves his eyes -- taking in his surroundings Like THE
SIGHT OF SOME DISASTROUS ZOOLOGICAL EXPERIMENT involving
whisky and gorillas Blue and red Christmas tree lights
replace lightbulbs used towels hanging everywhere
pornographic pictures ripped out of a magazine are plastered
on a shattered mirror

DUKE (V0O)
There was evidence in this room of
excessive consumption of almost
every type of drug known to
civilized man since 1544 AD

DUKE manages to move -- stiffly gets to his bare feet --
HOBBLES ROUND THE TRASHED ROOM like a newly risen ape

DUKE (V0)
But what kind of addict would need
all these coconut husks and crushed
honeydew rinds Would the presence
of junkies account for all these
uneaten french fries These
puddles of glazed ketchup on the
bureau Maybe so but then why all
this booze And these crude
pornographic photos smeared with
mustard that had dried to a hard
yellow crust

DUKE peers into Gonzos room -- HIS BED LIKE A BURNED OUT
RATS NEST -- blackened springs and wires
DUKE (V0)
These were not the hoof prints of
your normal god-fearing junkie It

was too savage too aggressive
QUICK FLASHBACK
GONZO SMASHES THE TEN FOOT MIRROR WITH A HAMMER
BACK IN THE ROOM
DUKE stares at the smashed mirror

DUKE (V0)
Grim memories and bad flashbacks

In the bathroom DUKES unlaced boots CRUSH BROKEN GLASS IN
VOMIT AND GRAPEFRUIT RINDS

DUKE unzips and pisses THERE IN THE TOILET BOWL IS THE
MAGNUM 357

DUKE (V0)
Something ugly had happened I was
sure of it
DUKE stares at the golden stream SPLASHING ON THE GUN
The SOUNDS OF VOMITING come from a closet near the front door

DUKE looks into the room He sees GONZOs ass sticking out
of the closet He opens his mouth to speak when IN THE
SMASHED MIRROR HE SEES THE FRAGMENTED REFLECTION OF HIMSELF

sleeping on the sofa
The ominous SOUND OF A KEY TURNING in the room lock

A hellish scream wakes up the SLEEPING DUKE He sees GONZO
grappling naked with the maid -- gun to her head GONZO is
muffling her screams with an ice bag

MAID
Please please Im only the
maid I didnt mean nothin

DUKE
(jumps up from the
bed flashing his
press badge)
YOURE UNDER ARREST

GONZO
(to DUKE)
She must have used a pass key I
was polishing my shoes in the
closet when I noticed her sneaking
in-so I took her

DUKE shakes his head

DUKE
(barks at the MAID)
What made you do it Who paid you
off

MAID
Nobody Im the maid

GONZO
Youre lying You were after the
evidence Who put you up to
this -- the manager

MAID

part of it as they are

MAID

DUKE

MAID
(blubbering)

GONZO laughs

GONZO
Come on baby dont try to tell us

MAID
No No I swear to Jesus I never
heard of that stuff

DUKE
Maybe shes telling the truth
Maybe shes not part of it

MAID
No I swear Im not

GONZO
(long pause)
In that case maybe she can help

MAID
Yes Ill help you all you need
I hate dope

DUKE
So do we lady

GONZO
(helping her up)
I think we should put her on the

payroll See what she comes up with

DUKE
Do you think you can handle it

MAID
What

GONZO
One phone call every day Just
tell us what youve seen Dont
worry if it doesnt add up thats
our problem

GONZO hustles the MAID to the door

MAID
Youd pay me for that

DUKE
Youre damn right But the first
time you say anything about this
to anybody -- youll go straight to
prison for the rest of your life
Whats your name

MAID
Alice Just ring Linen Service and
ask for Alice

GONZO
Alright Alice youll be
contacted by Inspector Rock
Arthur Rock Hell be posing as a
politician

DUKE

Inspector Rock will pay you In
cash A thousand dollars on the
ninth of every month

MAID
Oh Lord Id do just about anything
for that

GONZO
You and a lot of other people

DUKE
The password is One Hand Washes
The Other The minute you hear
that you say I fear nothing

MAID
I fear nothing

She repeats the password several times while they listen to
make sure she has it right

GONZO
Oh and dont bother to make up the
room That way we wont have to
risk another of these little
incidents will we

MAID

Whatever you say gentlemen I
cant tell you how sorry I am about
what happened

GONZO
Dont worry its all over now
Thank God for the decent people

She smiles repeating to herself One Hand Washes The Other
as GONZO hangs the DO NOT DISTURB sign and shuts the door

CUT BACK TO THE PRESENT
A grimy tape runs through a grunged-up portable tape recorder

GONZO ON TAPE
Thank God for the decent people

DUKE sits in the middle of the wrecked suite with his
mangled tape recorder in front of him

DUKE (VO)

hazy

DUKE (V0)
He did it very casually but I knew
that our peace was about to be

shattered

DUKE
What was that

GONZO shrugs

The WAITRESS stands at the end of the counter with her back
to them while she ponders the napkin She turns
WAITRESS
What is this

GONZO
A napkin

THE WAITRESS slams the napkin down on the counter

WAITRESS
Dont give me that bullshit I
know what it means You goddamn

fat pimp bastard

GONZO
Thats the name of a horse I used
to own Whats wrong with you

WAITRESS
You sonofabitch I take a lot of
shit in this place but I sure as
hell dont have to take it off a
SPIC PIMP

GONZO GOES VERY VERY STILL AT THIS

DUKE (V0)
Jesus I thought whats happening

DUKE picks up the napkin On it is printed in careful red
letters BACK DOOR BEAUTY

DUKE (VO CONTD)
The question mark was emphasized

WAITRESS
(screams )
Pay your bill and get the hell out
You want me to call the cops

GONZO
Spic pimp

GONZOs hand goes inside his shirt He PULLS OUT THE RAZOR-
SHARP HUNTING KNIFE

GONZO KEEPS HIS EYES ON THE WAITRESS He walks about six
feet down the aisle and lifts the receiver of the pay phone
He SLICES IT OFF then brings the receiver back to his stool
and sits down
DUKE (VO)

I was stupid with shock -- not
knowing whether to run or start
laughing
GONZO
(casual)

How much is the lemon meringue pie

DUKE (V0)
Her eyes were turgid with fear but
her brain was functioning on some
basic motor survival level

WAITRESS
(blurting -- on automatic)
Thirty-five cents

GONZO
(laughing)
I mean the whole pie

The WAITRESS MOANS GONZO places a 5 BILL on the counter

GONZO
Lets say five dollars Okay

GONZO walks round the counter TAKING THE PIE OUT OF THE
DISPLAY CASE

DUKE (V0)
The sight of the blade had triggered
bad memories The glazed look in

her eyes said her throat had been
cut She was still in the grip of
paralysis when we left

DUKE IS ROOTED TO THE SPOT

GONZO urges him out the door The camera retreats with them

The WAITRESS STANDS THERE -- PETRIFIED Alone in a lousy
bar at night

INT FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKEs face as he stares at the knife -- remembering
GONZO (V0)
Drive Drive Drive We have
fifteen fucking minutes to get me
on that plane

EXT ROAD ON OUTSKIRTS OF LAS VEGAS - DAY

The WHITE WHALE looking like shit -- its TOP HALF UP
TORN SLAPPING IN THE WIND -- ROARS THROUGH AN INTERSECTION
as the light turns red

DR GONZO FRANTICALLY PAWS OVER A MAP

DUKE drives -- SILENT AND FURIOUS -- sick to his stomach
with the PSYCHOTIC GONZO

GONZO
What are you doing You were
supposed to turn back there

DUKE (VO)
We had abused every rule that Vegas
lived by -- burning the locals
abusing the tourists terrifying
the help The only chance now I
felt was the possibility that wed
gone to such excess that nobody in
the position to bring the hammer
down on us could possibility
believe it

DUKE suddenly SLAMS ON THE BRAKES

GONZO
Jesus Christ
There crossing the road in front of them is LUCY -- her
paintings under her arm -- looking lost SHE LOOKS UP WITH

A VAGUE SENSE OF RECOGNITION

DUKE throws the car into a SKIDDING REVERSE TURN AND ROARS
OFF

EXT DESERT ROAD OUTSIDE LAS VEGAS - DAY

THE WHITE WHALE TEARS DOWN THE DESERTED FREEWAY GONZO
looks wildly around

GONZO
Goddamnit Were lost What are
we doing out here on this
godforsaken road

GONZO sees that THEYRE RUNNING PARALLEL WITH THE AIRPORT
RUNWAY

GONZO
The airport is over there

DUKE
Never missed a plane yet

DUKE HITS THE BRAKES and wrenches the wheel -- takes the
WHALE down into the grassy freeway divider WHEELS CHURNING
HE MAKES IT UP THE OPPOSITE BANK nose of the car straight
up then BOUNCES ONTO THE FREEWAY and keeps going right OVER
A FENCE dragging it through a cactus field and onto the
RUNWAY

GONZO is FROZEN WITH FEAR -- GRIPPING THE DASHBOARD He
throws a worried look at DUKE

DUKE
Ill drop you right next to the
plane

They SPEED UNDER A PARKED AIRPLANE SHOUTING ABOVE THE JET
ENGINE SCREAM

GONZO
No I cant get out Theyll
crucify me Ill have to take the
blame

DUKE

(irritatedly)
Ridiculous Just say you were
hitchhiking to the airport and I
picked you up You never saw me
before Shit this town is full of
white Cadillac convertibles I
plan to go through there so fast
that nobody will even glimpse the
goddamn license plate You ready

GONZO
Why not But for Christs sake
just do it fast
EXT AT THE AIRPLANE - DAY

DUKE SCREECHES UP in front of the DESERT AIR 727 GONZO
JUMPS OUT -- HEADS FOR THE PLANE

DUKE watches him go -- RELENTS
DUKE
Hey
GONZO stops -- turns
DUKE
Dont take any guff from those
swine Remember if you have any

trouble you can always send a
telegram to the Right People

GONZO
Yeah Explaining my Position
Some asshole wrote a poem about
that once

GONZO pauses

GONZO
Probably good advice if you have
shit for brains

GONZO turns and RACES TOWARDS THE STEPS JUST AS HE IS ABOUT
TO ENTER THE PLANE HE PAUSES AND LOOKS BACKSMILESAND
LEANS FORWARD AND VOMITS

DUKE (VO)
There he goes -- one of Gods own
prototypes -- a high powered mutant

of some kind never even considered
for mass production Too weird to
live and too rare to die

DUKE watches for a second then ROARS AWAY PULL BACK WITH
THE WHITE SHARK -- LEAVING THE AIRPLANE FAR BEHIND
INT FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITEAPOCALYPSE - NIGHT
On the TV an airplane soars thru the sky Pull back to find

DUKE barricaded in GONZOS BEDROOM He is typing on his
typewriter
DUKE
We are all wired into a survival
trip now No more of the speed
that fueled that 60s That was
the fatal flaw in Tim Learys trip
He crashed around America selling
consciousness expansion without
ever giving a thought to the grim
meat-hook realities that were lying
in wait for all the people who took
him seriously

DUKE records like A WAR CORRESPONDENT The CAMERA slowly
rises -- DUKE alone in the room with the TV SPEWING OUT
IMAGES OF WARS AND CIVIL UNREST OF THE 90S

DUKE

All those pathetically eager acid
freaks who thought they could buy
Peace and Understanding for three
bucks a hit But their loss and
failure is ours too What Leary
took down with him was the central
illusion of a whole life-style that
he helped create

RISING HIGHER -- THE WALLS OF THE ROOM APPEAR TO BY 20 TO 30
FEET HIGH DUKE SEEMS TO BE AT THE BOTTOM OF A WELL THE
CAMERA RISES UP THROUGH BROKEN TIMBERS

DUKE
a generation of permanent
cripples failed seekers who never
understood the essential old-mystic
fallacy of the Acid Culture the
desperate assumption that somebody

or at least some force -- is
tending the light at the end of the
tunnel

HIGHER STILL -- DUKE ALONE IN THE ROOM -- AN ISOLATED BOX
SURROUNDED BY THE TWISTED METAL AND RUBBLE AND SMASHED NEON
SIGNS OF THE DEAD CITY -- A BLASTED LANDSCAPE WITHOUT

LIGHT -- SHARDS OF A CIVILIZATION

EXT DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY

A BURNING FLARED-OUT SUN The camera pans down to DUKE
DRIVING THE WRECKED WHALE A piece of the fence flies out
of the back seat as he takes a bump

DUKE (V0)
There was only one road back to LA
US Interstate 15 just a flat-out
high speed burn through Baker and
Barstow and Berdoo then on to the
Hollywood Freeway straight into
frantic oblivion safety obscurity
just another freak in the Freak
Kingdom

DUKE sees THE HARDWARE BARN A RUSTIC OLD FARM BUILDING
facing the road with a single gas pump outside and a neon
sign that flashes beer

DUKE
Ahhh Wonderful

DUKE PULLS OFF THE ROAD and parks Gets out and walks in
INT HARDWARE BARN - BAKER CALIFORNIA - DAY

DUKE enters the DARK CLUTTERED INTERIOR Scattered all
about the store are BITS OF AMERICANA OLD BARRELS WAGON
WHEELS WOODEN YOKES A STUFFED HORSE HANGS FROM THE
RAFTERS The sunlight shafts through high windows AN OLD
MAN is repairing an iron pot-bellied stove near the wooden
bar A NORMAN ROCKWELL PAINTING ONLY REAL

PROPRIETOR
Whatll you have

DUKE cant quite believe this place -- too good to be true
DUKE
(doubtfully)

Ballantine Ale

THE PROPRIETOR serves the ale up ice cold DUKE SMILES AND
RELAXES

DUKE
Hard to find it served like this
anymore
As he drinks DUKE toys with a rack of key chains -- LITTLE

AMERICAN ICONS A REMINGTON COWBOY A BUGS BUNNY A TWEETY
PIE BETTY BOOP A BASEBALL PLAYER The logo on the rack
reads AMERICAN DREAM KEY RINGS

PROPRIETOR
Where ya comin from young man

DUKE
Las Vegas

PROPRIETOR
A great town that Vegas I bet
you had good luck there Youre
the type

DUKE
I know Im a triple Scorpio

PROPRIETOR
(trustingly)
Thats a fine combination You
cant lose

A LOVELY GIRL appears Seeing DUKE she smiles CAN THIS
REALLY BE HIS LUCKY DAY She approaches him and
KISSES THE PROPRIETOR

DUKE
(caught off guard muttering)
Oh my God
PROPRIETOR

(not understanding)
This is my granddaughter

DUKE

(recovering)
Dont worry

(leans forward in confidence)

and Im actually the District

Attorney from Ignoto County

(winks)
Just another good American like
yourself

A MOMENT THE PROPRIETORS SMILE DISAPPEARS

Wordlessly the PROPRIETOR and his GRANDDAUGHTER go to the
back of the store -- GET ON WITH THEIR WORK -- IGNORING DUKE

WHO FEELS ASHAMED

DUKE puts some money down on the bar and SLOWLY LEAVES
EXT HARDWARE BARN - DAY

A CHASTENED DUKE approaches the vomit streaked WHITE WHALE
Gets in -- sits there -- deflated -- miserable

A state bus draws up across from the Hardware Barn

Somberly DUKE watches as TWO YOUNG MARINES with duffel bags
step off -- chatting like TRUE BROTHERS

DUKE switches on the ignition Something rolls off the
trembling dash DUKE catches it

ONE SINGLE BEAUTIFUL AMYL CAPSULE

DUKE CRACKS THE AMYL -- INHALES THE RUSH MAKES HIM GASP --
TEETH BARED LIKE A MADMAN

DUKE
HOLY SHIT
DUKE GUNS THE ENGINE with a laugh -- leans out -- YELLS AT
THE MARINES
DUKE

GODS MERCY ON YOU SWINE

DUKE ROARS AWAY AN AMERICAN FLAG FLIES UP FROM THE DEBRIS
IN THE BACK SEAT MADLY UNFURLING ITSELF AS IT SNAGS ON THE
CONVERTIBLE-TOP FRAME OF THE TRASHED WHITE WHALE

The TWO MARINES look after him CONFUSED

EXT DESERT HIGHWAY

DUKE drives fast -- TEETH GRITTED IN FROZEN ECSTASY
DUKE CRANKS UP THE TAPE RECORDER

DUKE (VO)
My heart was filled with joy I
felt like a monster reincarnation
of Horatio Alger a man on the
move and just sick enough to be
totally confident
The WHITE WHALE WIPES THE SCREEN BLACK
