THE APARTMENT
A DESK COMPUTER

A mans hand is punching out a series of figures on the
keyboard

BUD (V0O)
On November first 1959 the
population of New York City was
8042783 if you laid all these
people end to end figuring an
average height of five feet six and
a half inches they would reach
from Times Square to the outskirts
of Karachi Pakistan I know facts
like this because I work for an
insurance company --

THE INSURANCE BUILDING - A WET FALL DAY

Its a big mother covering a square block in lower
Manhattan all glass and aluminum jutting into the leaden
sky

BUD (V0O)
-- Consolidated Life of New York
We are one of the top five companies
in the country -- last year we
wrote nine-point-three billion
dollars worth of policies Our
home office has 31259 employees --
which is more than the entire
population of Natchez Mississippi
of Gallup New Mexico

INT NINETEENTH FLOOR

Acres of gray steel desk gray steel filing cabinets and
steel-gray faces under indirect light One wall is lined
with glass-enclosed cubicles for the supervisory personnel
It is all very neat antiseptic impersonal The only human
tough is supplied by a bank of IBM machines clacking away
cheerfully in the background

BUD (V0O)
I work on the nineteenth floor --
Ordinary Policy Department -
Premium Accounting Division -
Section W -- desk number 861
DESK 861

Like every other desk it has a small name plate attached to
the side This one reads CC BAXTER

BUD (V0O)
My name is CC Baxter - C for
Calvin C for Clifford -- however

most people call me Bud Ive been
with Consolidated Life for three
years and ten months I started in
the branch office in Cincinnati
then transferred to New York My
take-home pay is 9470 a week and
there are the usual fringe benefits

BAXTER is about thirty serious hard-working unobtrusive
He wears a Brooks Brothers type suit which he bought
somewhere on Seventh Avenue upstairs There is a stack of
perforated premium cards in front of him and he is totaling
them on the computing machine He looks off

ELECTRIC WALL CLOCK

It shows 519 With a click the minute hand jumps to 520
and a piercing bell goes off

BUD (V0O)
The hours in our department are
850 to 520 --

FULL SHOT - OFFICE

Instantly all work stops Papers are being put away
typewriters and computing machines are covered and everybody
starts clearing out Within ten seconds the place is

empty -- except for Bud Baxter still bent over his work
marooned in a sea of abandoned desks

BUD (V0O)
-- theyre staggered by floors so
that sixteen elevators can handle
the 31259 employees without a
serious traffic jam As for
myself I very often stay on at the
office and work for an extra hour

or two -- especially when the
weather is bad Its not that Im
overly ambitious -- its just a way

of killing time until its all
right for me to go home

You see I have this little problem
with my apartment --

DISSOLVE TO
STREET IN THE WEST SIXTIES - EVENING

Bud wearing a weather-beaten Ivy League raincoat and a
narrow-brimmed brown hat comes walking slowly down the
street skirting the puddles on the sidewalk He stops in
front of a converted brownstone looks up

BUD (V0O)
I live in the West Sixties - just
half a block from Central Park My
rent is 84 a month It used to be
eighty until last July when Mrs
Lieberman the landlady put ina
second-hand air conditioning unit

The windows on the second floor are lit but the shades are
drawn From inside drifts the sound of cha cha music

BUD (V0O)
Its a real nice apartment -
nothing fancy -- but kind of
cozy -- just right for a bachelor
The only problem is - I cant
always get in when I want to

INT THE APARTMENT - EVENING

What used to be the upstairs parlor of a one-family house in
the early 1900s has been chopped up into living room
bedroom bathroom and kitchen The wallpaper is faded the
carpets are threadbare and the upholstered furniture could
stand shampooing There are lots of books a record player
stacks of records a television set (21 inches and 24
payments) unframed prints from the Museum of Modern Art
(Picasso Braque Klee) tacked up on the walls

Only one lamp is lit for mood and a cha cha record is
spinning around on the phonograph On the coffee table in
front of the couch are a couple of cocktail glasses a
pitcher with some martini dregs an almost empty bottle of
vodka a soup bowl with a few melting ice cubes at the
bottom some potato chips an ashtray filled with cigar
stubs and lipstick-stained cigarette butts and a womans
handbag

MR KIRKEBY a dapper middle-aged man stands in front of
the mirror above the fake fireplace buttoning up his vest
He does not notice that the buttons are out of alignment

KIRKEBY
(calling off)
Come on Sylvia Its getting late

SYLVIA a first baseman of a dame redheaded and saftig
comes cha cha-ing into the room trying to fasten a necklace
as she hums along with the music She dances amorously up
to Kirkeby

KIRKEBY
Cut it out Sylvia We got to get
out of here

He helps her with the necklace then turns off the phonograph
SYLVIA
Whats the panic Im going to

have another martooni

She crosses to the coffee table starts to pour the remnants
of the vodka into the pitcher

KIRKEBY
Please Sylvia Its a quarter to
nine

SYLVIA

(dropping slivers of

ice into the pitcher)
First you cant wait to get me up
here and now -- rush rush rush
Makes a person feel cheap

KIRKEBY
Sylvia -- sweetie -- its not
that -- but I promised the guy Id
be out of here by eight oclock
positively

SYLVIA
(pouring martini)
What guy Whose apartment is this
anyway

KIRKEBY
(exasperated)
Whats the difference Some
schnook that works in the office

EXT BROWNSTONE HOUSE - EVENING

Bud is pacing back and forth throwing an occasional glance
at the lit windows of his apartment A middle-aged woman
with a dog on a leash approaches along the sidewalk

She is MRS LIEBERMAN the dog is a Scottie and they are
both wearing raincoats Seeing them Bud leans casually
against the stoop

MRS LIEBERMAN
Good evening Mr Baxter

BUD
Good evening Mrs Lieberman
MRS LIEBERMAN

the steps)

She and the Scottie disappear into the house Bud resumes
pacing his eyes on the apartment windows Suddenly he
stops -- the lights have gone out

INT SECOND FLOOR LANDING - EVENING

darkened apartment

KIRKEBY

Sylvia comes cha cha-ing out wearing an imitation Persian
lamb coat her hat askew on her head bag gloves and an
umbrella in her hand

SYLVIA
Some setup you got here A real
honest-to-goodness love nest

KIRKEBY
Sssssh

He locks the door slips the key under the doormat

SYLVIA
(still cha cha-ing)
Youre one button off Mr Kirkeby

She points to his exposed vest Kirkeby looks down sees
that the buttons are out of line He starts to rebutton
them as they move down the narrow dimly-lit stairs

SYLVIA
You got to watch those things
Wives are getting smarter all the
time Take Mr Bernheim -- in the
Claims Department -- came home one
night with lipstick on his shirt --
told his wife he had a shrimp
cocktail for lunch -- so she took

it out to the lab and had it
analyzed -- so now she has the

house in Great Neck and the children
and the new Jaguar --

KIRKEBY
Dont you ever stop talking

EXT BROWNSTONE HOUSE - EVENING

Bud standing on the sidewalk sees the front door start to
open He moves quickly into the areaway almost bumping
into the ashcans stands in the shadow of the stoop with his
back turned discreetly toward Kirkeby and Sylvia as they
come down the steps

KIRKEBY
Where do you live

SYLVIA
I told you -- with my mother

KIRKEBY
Where does she live

SYLVIA
A hundred and seventy-ninth
street -- the Bronx

KIRKEBY

a cab

KIRKEBY

Why do all you dames have to live
in the Bronx

SYLVIA

married man

They move down the street Bud appears from the areaway
glances after them then mounts the steps goes through the
front door

INT VESTIBULE - EVENING

There are eight mailboxes Bud opens his takes out a
magazine in a paper wrapper and a few letters proceeds up
the staircase
INT SECOND FLOOR LANDING - EVENING

Bud glancing through his mail comes up to the door of his
apartment As he bends down to lift the doormat the door
of the rear apartment opens and MRS DREYFUSS a jovial
well-fed middle-aged woman puts out a receptacle full of
old papers and empty cans Bud looks around from his bent
position

BUD
Oh Hello there Mrs Dreyfuss

MRS DREYFUSS
Something the matter

BUD
I seem to have dropped my key
(faking a little search)

Oh -- here it is

He slides it out from under the mat straightens up

MRS DREYFUSS
Such a racket I heard in your

place -- maybe you had burglars
BUD

Oh you dont have to worry about

that -- nothing in there that

anybody would want to steal
(unlocking door quickly)
Good night Mrs Dreyfuss

He ducks into the apartment
INT THE APARTMENT - EVENING

Bud snaps on the lights drops the mail and the key on a
small table looks around with distaste at the mess his
visitors have left behind He sniffs the stale air crosses
to the window pulls up the shade opens it wide Now he
takes off his hat and raincoat gathers up the remains of
the cocktail party from the coffee table Loaded down with
glasses pitcher empty vodka bottle ice bowl and potato
chips he starts toward the kitchen

The doorbell rings Bud stops undecided what to do with
the stuff in his hands then crosses to the hall door

barely manages to get it open Mr Kirkeby barges in past
him

KIRKEBY
The little lady forgot her galoshes

He scours the room for the missing galoshes
BUD
Mr Kirkeby I dont like to
complain -- but you were supposed
to be out of here by eight

KIRKEBY
I know Buddy-boy I know But
those things dont always run on

schedule -- like a Greyhound bus
BUD

I dont mind in the summer -- but

on a rainy night -- and I havent

had any dinner yet --

KIRKEBY
Sure sure Look kid -- I put in
a good word for you with Sheldrake
in Personnel

BUD
(perking up)
Mr Sheldrake

KIRKEBY
Thats right We were discussing
our department -- manpower-wise --

and promotion-wise --

(finds the galoshes

behind a chair)
-- and I told him what a bright boy
you were Theyre always on the
lookout for young executives

BUD

Thank you Mr Kirkeby

KIRKEBY
(starting toward door)
Youre on your way up Buddy-boy
And youre practically out of liquor

BUD

vermouth -- and put my name on it
BUD

for the last two bottles --

KIRKEBY

(in the open doorwaY)
And whatever happened to those
little cheese crackers you used to
have around

He exits shutting the door

BUD
(making a mental note)
Cheese crackers

He carries his load into the kitchen

The kitchen is minute and cluttered On the drainboard are
an empty vermouth bottle some ice-cube trays a jar with
one olive in it and a crumpled potato-chip bag

Bud comes in dumps his load on the drainboard opens the
old-fashioned refrigerator He takes out a frozen chicken
dinner turns the oven on lights it with a match rips the
protective paper off the aluminum tray and shoves it in

Now he starts to clean up the mess on the drainboard He
rinses the cocktail glasses is about to empty the martini
pitcher into the sink thinks better of it He pours the
contents into a glass plops the lone olive out of the jar
scoops up the last handful of potato chips toasts an
imaginary companion and drinks up Then he pulls a
wastebasket from under the sink

It is brimful of liquor bottles and Bud adds the empty
vodka and vermouth bottles and the olive jar Picking up
the heavy receptacle he carries it through the living room
toward the hall door

INT SECOND FLOOR LANDING - EVENING

The door of Buds apartment opens and Bud comes out with
the wastebasket full of empty bottles Just then DR DAVID
DREYFUSS whose wife we met earlier comes trudging up the
stairs He is a tall heavy-set man of fifty with a bushy
mustache wearing a bulky overcoat and carrying an aged
medical bag

DR DREYFUSS
Good evening Baxter

BUD
Hi Doc Had a late call

DR DREYFUSS
Yeah Some clown at Schraffts
57th Street ate a club sandwich
and forgot to take out the toothpick

BUD
Oh
(sets down wastebasket)
Bye Doc

DR DREYFUSS
(indicating bottles)
Say Baxter -- the way youre
belting that stuff you must have a
pair of cast-iron kidneys

BUD
Oh thats not me Its just that
once in a while I have some people
in for a drink

DR DREYFUSS
As a matter of fact you must be an
iron man all around From what I
hear through the walls you got
something going for you every night

BUD
Im sorry if it gets noisy --

DR DREYFUSS
Sometimes theres a twi-night
double-header
(shaking his head)
A nebbish like you

BUD
(uncomfortable)
Yeah Well -- see you Doc

(starts to back
through door)

DR DREYFUSS

You know Baxter -- Im doing some
research at the Columbia Medical
Center -- and I wonder if you could

do us a favor

BUD
Me

DR DREYFUSS
When you make out your will -- and
the way youre going you should --
would you mind leaving your body to
the University

BUD
My body Im afraid you guys would
be disappointed Good night Doc

DR DREYFUSS
Slow down kid
He starts into the rear apartment as Bud closes the door
INT THE APARTMENT - EVENING

Bud loosening his tie goes into the kitchen opens the
oven turns off the gas He takes a coke out of the
refrigerator uncaps it gets a knife and fork froma
drawer and using his handkerchief as a potholder pulls the
hot aluminum tray out of the oven He carries everything
out into the living room

In the living room Bud sets his dinner down on the coffee
table settles himself on the couch He rears up as
something stabs him reaches under his buttocks pulls out a
hairpin He drops it into an ashtray tackles his dinner
Without even looking he reaches over to the end table and
presses the remote TV station-selector He takes a sip from
the coke bottle his eyes on the TV screen across the room

The picture on the TV set jells quickly Against a
background of crisscrossing searchlights a pompous announcer
is making his spiel

ANNOUNCER

-- from the worlds greatest
library of film classics we
proudly present --

(fanfare)
Greta Garbo -- John Barrymore --
Joan Crawford -- Wallace Beery --
and Lionel Barrymore in --

(fanfare)
GRAND HOTEL

There is an extended fanfare Bud leans forward chewing
excitedly on a chicken leg

ANNOUNCER
But first a word from our sponsor
If you smoke the modern way dont
be fooled by phony filter claims --

Bud still eating automatically reaches for the station-
selector pushes the button

A new channel pops on It features a Western -- Cockamamie
Indians are attacking a stagecoach

Thats not for Bud He switches to another station Ina
frontier saloon Gower Street cowboys are dismantling the
furniture and each other

Bud wearily changes channels But he cant get away from
Westerns -- on this station the US Cavalry is riding to
the rescue Will they get there in time
Bud doesnt wait to find out He switches channels again
and is back where he started

On the screen once more is the announcer standing in front
of the crisscrossing searchlights

ANNOUNCER
And now Grand Hotel -- starring
Greta Garbo John Barrymore Joan

Crawford --
(Bud is all eyes and
ears again)
-- Wallace Beery and Lionel
Barrymore But first -- a word
from our alternate sponsor
(unctuously)
Friends do you have wobbly
dentures --

That does it Bud turns the set off in disgust

The TV screen blacks out except for a small pinpoint of
light in the center which gradually fades away

In the bathroom Bud in pajamas by now is brushing his
teeth From the shower rod hang three pairs of socks on
stretchers Bud takes a vial from the medicine shelf
shakes out a sleeping pill washes it down with a glass of
water He turns the light off walks into the bedroom

In the bedroom the single bed is made and the lamp on the
night table is on Bud plugs in the electric blanket turns
the dial on Then he climbs into bed props up the pillow
behind him From the night table he picks up the magazine
that arrived in the mail slides it out of the wrapper
opens it Its the new issue of PLAYBOY Bud leafs through
it till he comes to the piece de resistance of the magazine
He unfolds the overleaf glances at it casually refolds it
then turns to the back of the magazine and starts to read

What he is so avidly interested in is the mens fashion
section There is a layout titled WHAT THE YOUNG EXECUTIVE
WILL WEAR with a sub-head reading The Bowler is Back
Illustrating the article are several photographs of male
models wearing various styles of bowlers

Bud is definitely in the market for a bowler but somehow
his mind starts wandering He turns back to the overleaf
again unfolds it studies it then holds the magazine up
vertically to get a different perspective on the subject

By now the sleeping pill is beginning to take effect and he
yawns He drops the magazine on the floor kills the light
settles down to sleep The room is dark except for the glow
from the dial of the electric blanket

Three seconds Then the phone jangles shrilly in the living
room Bud stumbles groggily out of bed and putting on his
slippers makes his way into the living room He switches
on the light picks up the phone

BUD
Hello -- Hello -- yes this is
Baxter

INT PHONE BOOTH IN A MANHATTAN BAR - NIGHT

He reappears from the bedroom pulling his trousers on over
his pajama pants

BUD
-- We never close at Buddy-boys --

(he chuckles a la Dobisch)

Putting on his raincoat and hat Bud opens the hall door
takes the key from the table shoves it under the doormat
His eyes fall on the Dreyfuss apartment and there is some
concern on his face He picks up a pad and pencil from the
table prints something in block letters Tearing off the
top sheet he impales it on the spindle of the phonograph
then walks out closing the door behind him The note reads

NOT TOO LOUD
THE NEIGHBORS ARE COMPLAINING

EXT BROWNSTONE HOUSE - NIGHT
Bud comes out the door in slippered feet pants and raincoat
over his pajamas As he sleep-walks down the steps a cab
pulls up in front of the house Bud ducks discreetly into
the areaway Mr Dobisch bareheaded emerges cautiously
from the cab Between the fingers of his hands he is
carrying four long-stemmed glasses brimful of stingers

The blonde steps out holding his hat

BLONDE
This the place

DOBISCH
Yeah
(to cab driver)

CABBIE

Dobisch his hands full of stingers turns to the blonde
indicates his pants pocket

DOBISCH

The blonde plants the hat on top of his head unbuttons his
overcoat reaches into his pants pocket As she does so
she jogs his elbow

DOBISCH
Watch those stingers

The blonde has taken out Dobischs money clip with about a
hundred dollars in it

DOBISCH
Give him a buck

The blonde peels a bill off hands it to the cabbie hangs
on to the rest of the roll just a second too long

DOBISCH
Now put it back honey
(she does)

Atta girl

The cab drives off Dobisch and the blonde start up the
steps to the house

BLONDE

You sure this is a good idea
DOBISCH

Cant think of a better one

BLONDE
(holding door open
for him)

I mean - barging in on your
mother -- in the middle of the night
DOBISCH

(edging past her with stingers
Dont worry about the old lady
One squawk from her and shes out
of a job

In the areaway Bud has overheard them and it doesnt make
him any happier He steps out on the sidewalk shuffles
down the street

INT SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT

The blonde and Dobisch his hands full of stingers come up
to Buds door

DOBISCH
Get the key will you

Automatically she reaches into his pocket

DOBISCH

So this is your mothers apartment

DOBISCH
Thats right Maria Ouspenskaya
BLONDE
(sticking her head in)
Hiya Ouspenskaya

Dobisch nudges her inside with his knee kicks the door shut
behind him

The landing is empty for a second Then the door of the

rear apartment opens and Dr Dreyfuss in a beaten bathrobe
sets out a couple of empty milk bottles with a note in them
Suddenly from Buds apartment comes a shrill female giggle
Dr Dreyfuss reacts Then the cha cha music starts full
blast

DR DREYFUSS
(calling to his wife
off-screen)
Mildred -- hes at it again

Shaking his head he closes the door
EXT CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT

Bud in raincoat and slippered feet turns in off the
street plods along a path in the deserted park He stops
at a damp bench under a lamp post sits In the background
lights shine from the towering buildings on Central Park
South

Bud huddles inside his raincoat shivering He is very
sleepy by now His eyes close and his head droops A gust
of wind sends wet leaves swirling across the bench Bud
doesnt stir He is all in

FADE OUT
FADE IN
INT LOBBY INSURANCE BUILDING - DAY

Its a quarter to nine of a gray November morning and work-
bound employees are piling in through the doors Among them
is Bud bundled up in a raincoat hat heavy muffler and
wool gloves and carrying a box of Kleenex He coughs
pulls out a tissue wipes his dripping nose He has a bad
cold

The lobby is an imposing marbled affair as befits a
company which last year wrote 93 billion dollars worth of
insurance There are sixteen elevators eight of them
marked LOCAL - FLOORS 1-18 and opposite them eight marked
EXPRESS - FLOORS 18-37 The starter a uniformed Valkyrie
wielding a clicker is directing the flow of traffic into
the various elevators

Bud joins the crowd in front of one of the express elevators
Also standing there is Mr Kirkeby reading the Herald-
Tribune

BUD
(hoarsely)
Good morning Mr Kirkeby

KIRKEBY
(as if he just knew
him vaguely)
Oh how are you Baxter They
keeping you busy these days
BUD
Yes sir They are indeed
(he sniffs)

The elevator doors open revealing the operator She is in
her middle twenties and her name is FRAN KUBELIK Maybe
its the way shes put together maybe its her face or

maybe its just the uniform -- in any case there is
something very appealing about her She is also an
individualist -- she wears a carnation in her lapel which

is strictly against regulations As the elevator loads she
greets the passengers cheerfully

FRAN
(rattling it off)

Morning Mr Kessel -- Morning

Miss Robinson -- Morning Mr
Kirkeby -- Morning Mr Williams --
Morning Miss Livingston -- Morning
Mr McKellway -- Morning Mr
Pirelli -- Morning Mrs Schubert --

Interspersed is an occasional Morning Miss Kubelik from
the passengers

FRAN
Morning Mr Baxter

BUD
Morning Miss Kubelik

He takes his hat off -- he is the only one The express is
now loaded

STARTER
(working the clicker)
Thats all Take it away

FRAN
(shutting the door)
Watch the door please Blasting
off

INT ELEVATOR

Bud is standing right next to Fran as the packed express
shoots up

BUD
(studying her)
What did you do to your hair

FRAN
It was making me nervous so I
chopped it off Big mistake huh
BUD
I sort of like it

He sniffs takes out a Kleenex wipes his nose

FRAN
Say you got a lulu

BUD
Yeah I better not get too close

FRAN
Oh I never catch colds

BUD
Really I was looking at some
figures from the Sickness and
Accident Claims Division -- do you
know that the average New Yorker
between the ages of twenty and
fifty has two and a half colds a
year

FRAN
That makes me feel just terrible

BUD
Why

FRAN
Well to make the figures come out
even -- since I have no colds a
year -- some poor slob must have

five colds a year

BUD
Thats me
(dabs his nose)

FRAN
You should have stayed in bed this
morning

BUD
I should have stayed in bed last
night

The elevator has slowed down now stops Fran opens the door

FRAN
Nineteen Watch your step

About a third of the passengers get out including Bud and
Mr Kirkeby As Kirkeby passes Fran he slaps her behind
with his folded newspaper Fran jumps slightly
FRAN
(all in the days work)
And watch your hand Mr Kirkeby

KIRKEBY
(innocently)
I beg your pardon

FRAN
One of these days Im going to shut
those doors on you and --

She withdraws her hand into the sleeve of her uniform and
waves the amputated arm at him

FRAN
Twenty next

The doors close
INT NINETEENTH FLOOR - DAY

Kirkeby turns away from the elevator and grinning smugly
falls in beside Bud

KIRKEBY
That Kubelik -- boy Would I like
to get her on a slow elevator to
China

BUD
Oh yes Shes the best operator
in the building

KIRKEBY
Im a pretty good operator myself --
but she just wont give me a

tumble -- date-wise

BUD
Maybe youre using the wrong
approach

KIRKEBY
A lot of guys around here have
tried it -- all kinds of
approaches -- no dice What is she

trying to prove

BUD
Could be shes just a nice
respectable girl -- there are

millions of them

KIRKEBY
Listen to him Little Lord
Fauntleroy
Leaving Bud at the employees coat-racks Kirkeby heads
toward his office one of the glass-enclosed cubicles Bud
hangs up his hat and raincoat stows away the gloves and
muffler Out of his coat pocket he takes a plastic anti-
histamine sprayer and a box of cough drops and still
carrying the Kleenex threads his way to his desk Most of
the desks are already occupied and the others are filling
rapidly

Once seated at his desk Bud arranges his medicaments neatly
in front of him He takes a Kleenex out of the box blows
his nose then leaning back in his swivel chair sprays first
one nostril then the other Suddenly the piercing bell goes
off -- the workday has begun Being the ultra-conscientious
type Bud instantly sits upright in his chair removes the
cover from his computing machine picks up a batch of
perforated premium cards starts entering figures on his
computer

After a few seconds he glances around to make sure that
everybody in the vicinity is busy Then he looks up a number
in the company telephone directory dials furtively

BUD
(cupping hand over
phone mouthpiece)
Hello Mr Dobisch This is Baxter
on the nineteenth floor

INT DOBISCHS OFFICE - DAY

It is a glass-enclosed cubicle on the twenty-first floor
Through the glass we see another enormous layout of desks
everybody working away Dobisch is holding the phone in one
hand running an electric shaver over his face with the other

DOBISCH
Oh Buddy-boy I was just about to
call you
(shuts off electric shaver)
Im sorry about that mess on the
living room wall You see my

INT SHELDRAKES OFFICE - DAY

Mr Sheldrake is a 14000 a year man and rates a four-
window office

It is not quite an executive suite but it is several pegs
above the glass cubicles of the middle echelon There is
lots of leather and a large desk behind which sits MR
SHELDRAKE He is a substantial looking authoritative man in
his middle forties a pillar of his suburban community a
blood donor and a family man The latter is attested to by a
framed photograph showing two boys aged 8 and 10 in
military school uniforms

As Baxter comes through the door Sheldrake is leafing
through Dobischs efficiency report He looks up at Bud

through a pair of heavy-rimmed reading glasses

SHELDRAKE
Baxter

BUD
Yes sir

SHELDRAKE
(studying him)
I was sort of wondering what you
looked like Sit down

BUD
Yes Mr Sheldrake

He seats himself on the very edge of the leather armchair

facing Sheldrake

SHELDRAKE

about you -- heres a report from
Mr Dobisch -- loyal cooperative
resourceful --

Mr Dobisch said that

SHELDRAKE

at the office -- without overtime
BUD
(modestly)
Well you know how it is -- things
pile up
SHELDRAKE

Mr Vanderhof in Public Relations
and Mr Eichelberger in Mortgage
and Loan -- theyd both like to
have you transferred to their
departments

BUD

across the desk toward Bud

Tell me Baxter -- just what is it
that makes you so popular

BUD
I dont know

know everything that goes on in
this building -- in every
department -- on every floor --
every day of the year

BUD
(in a very small voice)
You do

SHELDRAKE

(rises starts pacing)
In 1957 we had an employee here
name of Fowler He was very popular
too Turned out he was running a
bookie joint right in the Actuarial
Department tying up the switchboard
figuring the odds on our IBM
machines -- so the day before the
Kentucky Derby I called in the
Vice Squad and we raided the
thirteenth floor

BUD
(worried)
The Vice Squad

SHELDRAKE
Thats right Baxter

BUD

(a deep breath)
Well about six months ago -- I was

going to night school taking this
course in Advanced Accounting --
and one of the guys in our
department -- he lives in Jersey --
e was going to a banquet at the
Biltmore -- his wife was meeting

im in town and he needed someplace
to change into a tuxedo -- so I
gave him the key and word must
ave gotten around -- because the
next thing I knew all sorts of
guys were suddenly going to
banquets -- and when you give the
ey to one guy you cant say no to
another and the whole thing got out
of hand -- pardon me

He whips out the nasal-spray administers a couple of quick
squirts up each nostril

SHELDRAKE

Baxter an insurance company is
founded on public trust Any
employee who conducts himself in a
manner unbecoming --

(shifting into a new gear)
How many charter members are there

BUD

SHELDRAKE

apples in a barrel -- no matter how
large the barrel -- you realize
that if this ever leaked out --

BUD
Oh it wont Believe me And its
not going to happen again From now

In his vehemence he squeezes the spray bottle which squirts
all over the desk

SHELDRAKE

BUD

what Ive been going through --
with the neighbors and the landlady
and the liquor and the key --

SHELDRAKE

EXT DOWNTOWN STREET - EVENING

Fran comes hurrying along the street She is late Her
objective is a small Chinese restaurant with a neon sign
reading THE RICKSHAW - COCKTAILS - CANTONESE FOOD She
starts down a flight of steps leading to the entrance

INT CHINESE RESTAURANT - EVENING

The bar is a long narrow dimly-lit room with booths along
one side Beyond a bamboo curtain is the main dining room

which does not concern us The place is decorated in Early

Beachcomber style rattan fish-nets conch-shells etc

The help is Chinese At this early hour there are only half
a dozen customers in the place -- all at the bar except for
one man sitting in the last booth with his back toward
camera At a piano a Chinese member of Local 808 is
improvising mood music

Fran comes through the door and without looking around
heads straight for the last booth The bartender nods to
her -- they know her there As she passes the piano player
he gives her a big smile segues into JEALOUS LOVER

Fran comes up to the man sitting in the last booth

FRAN
(a wistful smile)
Good evening Mr Sheldrake

Sheldrake for thats who it is looks around nervously to
make sure no one has heard her

SHELDRAKE
Please Fran -- not so loud

FRAN
Still afraid somebody may see us
together

SHELDRAKE

the wife and the girl --

(she is barely able

to control herself
They dont make these shrimp like

SHELDRAKE
I never said goodbye Fran

FRAN

(not listening)
For a while there you try kidding
yourself that youre going with an
unmarried man Then one day he
keeps looking at his watch and
asks you if theres any lipstick
showing then rushes off to catch
the seven-fourteen to White Plains
So you fix yourself a cup of
instant coffee -- and you sit there
by yourself -- and you think -- and
it all begins to look so ugly --

There are tears in her eyes She breaks off downs whats
left of the daiquiri

SHELDRAKE
How do you think I felt -- riding
home on that seven-fourteen train

FRAN
Why do you keep calling me Jeff
What do you want from me

He has piled everything on his blotter pad -- reference
books papers a fountain pen set pencils paper clips and
the calendar Watching him from the next desk is a
dumbfounded Moffett Bud picks up the blotter pad with his
stuff on it and as he moves past Moffetts desk Moffett
takes out a dollar bill drops it grudgingly on the loaded
pad Bud flashes him a little grin continues between the
desks toward the row of glass-enclosed offices housing the
supervisory personnel

He comes up to an unoccupied cubicle A sign painter is
brushing in some new lettering on the glass door -- it reads

She tears off her headset and turns to the other girls

SYLVIA
Somebody watch my line -- theres a
swinging party up on the nineteenth
floor --

She scoots out the door The other girls immediately abandon
their posts and dash after her

INT NINETEENTH FLOOR - DAY

Its a swinging party all right Nobody is working Several
desks have been cleared and pushed together and on top of
this improvised stage four female employees and Mr Dobisch
with his pants-legs rolled up are doing a Rockette kick
routine to the tune of JINGLE BELLS Employees are ringed
around the performers some drinking out of paper cups
others singing and clapping in rhythm

One of the cubicles has been transformed into a bar and it
is jammed with people Mr Kirkeby and Mr Vanderhof are
pouring -- each has a couple of bottles of liquor in his
hands and is emptying them into the open top of a water-
cooler

But the stuff is flowing out as fast as it flows in --
everybody is in line with a paper cup waiting for a refill

Bud comes shouldering his way out of the crowded cubicle
holding aloft two paper cups filled with booze Since his
promotion he has bought himself a new suit dark flannel
and with it he wears a white shirt with a pinned round
collar and a foulard tie He also has quite a glow on
Detouring past necking couples he heads in the direction of
the elevators

The doors of Frans elevator are just opening and the
switchboard operators led by Sylvia come streaming out

SYLVIA
(to a colleague)
-- so I said to him Never again --
either get yourself a bigger car or
a smaller girl --

As they head for the party they pass Bud who is approaching
the elevator with the two drinks Fran is just closing the
elevator doors

BUD
Miss Kubelik

The doors slide open again and Fran looks out Instead of
the customary carnation in the lapel of her uniform she
wears a sprig of holly

BUD
(holding out one of
the drinks)
Marry Christmas

FRAN
Thank you
(takes drink)
thought you were avoiding me

H

BUD
What gave you that idea

FRAN
In the last six weeks youve only
been in my elevator once -- and

then you didnt take your hat off

BUD

Well as a matter of fact I was
rather hurt when you stood me up
that night --

FRAN
I dont blame you It was
unforgivable

BUD
I forgive you

FRAN
You shouldnt

BUD
You couldnt help yourself I mean
when youre having a drink with one
man you cant just suddenly walk
out on him because you have another
date with another man You did the
only decent thing

FRAN
Dont be too sure Just because I
wear a uniform -- that doesnt make

me a Girl Scout

BUD

Miss Kubelik one doesnt get to be
a second administrative assistant
around here unless hes a pretty
good judge of character -- and as
far as Im concerned youre tops
I mean decency-wise -- and
otherwise-wise

(toasting)
Cheers

FRAN
Cheers

They down their drinks

Bud takes the empty cup from her

BUD
One more

FRAN
(indicating elevator)
I shouldnt drink when Im driving

BUD
Youre so right

He reaches into the elevator takes a cardboard sign off a
hook hangs it on the elevator door It reads USE OTHER
ELEVATOR

BUD
By the power vested in me I
herewith declare this elevator out
of order
(leading her toward
the party)
Shall we join the natives

FRAN

Why not

(as they pass a
kissing couple)
They seem friendly enough

BUD

Dont you believe it Later on
there will be human sacrifices --
white collar workers tossed into
t
f£

e computing machines and punched
ull of those little square holes

FRAN
How many of those drinks did you
have
BUD
(holding up four fingers)
Three

FRAN
I thought so

They have now reached the entrance to the bar which is
overflowing with thirsty natives

BUD
You wait here I think I hear the
sound of running water

He leaves her outside the cubicle and elbows his way
through the crowd toward the booze-filled water cooler Out
of another cubicle comes Miss Olsen cup in hand She too
has had quite a few Seeing Fran she walks up to her with
an acid smile on her face
MISS OLSEN
Hi Hows the branch manager from
Kansas City

FRAN
I beg your pardon
MISS OLSEN
Im Miss Olsen -- Mr Sheldrakes
secretary
FRAN
Yes I know
MISS OLSEN

So you dont have to play innocent
with me He used to tell his wife

that I was the branch manager from
Seattle -- four years ago when we

were having a little ring-a-ding-

ding

FRAN
I dont know what youre talking
about

MISS OLSEN
And before me there was Miss Rossi
in Auditing -- and after me there
was Miss Koch in Disability -- and
just before you there was Miss
Whats-Her-Name on the twenty-
fifth floor --

FRAN
(wanting to get away)
Will you excuse me

MISS OLSEN

(holding her by the arm)
What for You havent done
anything -- its him -- what a
salesman -- always the last booth
in the Chinese restaurant -- and
the same pitch about divorcing his
wife -- and in the end you wind up
with egg foo yong on your face

Bud comes burrowing out of the crowded cubicle balancing
the two filled paper cups spots Fran

BUD
Miss Kubelik

Fran turns away from Miss Olsen

FRAN
Well -- thank you

MISS OLSEN

Always happy to do something for
our girls in uniform

She moves off as Bud joins Fran who is looking a little pale

BUD

You all right Whats the matter

FRAN

Nothing

There

(takes the drink)
are just too many people here

BUD

Why dont we step into any office

There

s something I want your

advice about anyway

(leads her toward his cubicle)

I have my own office now naturally
And you may be interested to know
Im the second youngest executive
in the company -- the only one
younger is a grandson of the
chairman of the board

INT BAXTERS OFFICE - DAY

Bud ushers Fran in and is confronted by a strange couple

necking in t
desk

From under t

e corner He gestures them out crosses to his

BUD

Miss Kubelik I would like your
onest opinion Ive had this in my
desk for a week -- cost me fifteen
dollars -- but I just couldnt get
up enough nerve to wear it --

e desk he has produced a hatbox and out of the

hatbox a black bowler which he now puts on his head

BUD

Its what they call the junior
executive model What do you think

Fran looks at him blankly absorbed in her own thoughts

Guess

No --

BUD
I made a boo-boo huh

FRAN
(paying attention again)
I like it
BUD
Really You mean you wouldnt be
ashamed to be seen with somebody in
a hat like this

FRAN
Of course not

BUD
Maybe if I wore it a little more to
the side --
(adjusting hat)
is that better

FRAN
Much better

BUD
Well as long as you wouldnt be
ashamed to be seen with me -- how
about the three of us going out
this evening -- you and me and the
bowler -- stroll down Fifth
Avenue -- sort of break it in --

FRAN

This is a bad day for me

BUD
I understand Christmas -- family
and all that --

FRAN
Id better get back to my elevator
I dont want to be fired

BUD
Oh you dont have to worry about
that I have quite a bit of
influence in Personnel You know Mr

Sheldrake
FRAN
(guardedly)
Why
BUD

He and I are like this
(crosses his fingers)
Sent me a Christmas card See

He has picked up a Christmas card from his desk shows it to
Fran It is a photograph of the Sheldrake clan grouped
around an elaborate Christmas tree -- Mr and Mrs
Sheldrake the two boys in military school uniforms and a
big French poodle Underneath it says
SEASONS GREETINGS
from the SHELDRAKES
Emily Jeff Tommy Jeff Jr
and Figaro

FRAN
(studying the card ruefully)
Makes a cute picture

BUD
I thought maybe I could put ina
word for you with Mr Sheldrake --

get you a little promotion -- how
would you like to be an elevator
starter

FRAN

Im afraid there are too many other
girls around here with seniority

over me

BUD
No problem Why dont we discuss it
sometime over the holidays -- I

could call you and pick you up and
well have the big unveiling --
(touching the brim of
his bowler)
-- you sure this is the right way
to wear it

FRAN
I think so

BUD
You dont think its tilted a
little too much --

Fran takes her compact out of her uniform pocket opens
hands it to Bud

FRAN
Here

BUD
(examining himself in
the mirror)
After all this is a conservative
firm -- I dont want people to
think Im an entertainer --

His voice trails off There is something familiar about

it

the

cracked mirror of the compact -- and the fleur-de-lis

pattern on the case confirms his suspicion
peculiar expression on his face

FRAN

Fran notices the
What is it

BUD
(with difficulty)
The mirror -- its broken
FRAN
I know I like it this way -- makes

me look the way I feel

The phone has started to ring Bud doesnt hear it He
closes the compact hands it to Fran

FRAN
Your phone
BUD
Oh

Yes

(throws a quick look

at Fran)
Just a minute

(covers mouthpiece

to Fran)
If you dont mind -- this is sort
of personal

FRAN
All right Have a nice Christmas

She exits closing the door Bud takes his hand off the
mouthpiece

BUD
(every word hurts)
Yes Mr Sheldrake -- no I didnt
forget -- the tree is up and the
Tom and Jerry mix is in the
refrigerator -- yes sir -- same to
you

He hangs up stands there for a moment the bowler still on
his head the noise from the party washing over him He
slowly crosses to the clothes-tree picks up his coat -- a
new black chesterfield With the coat over his arm he
starts out of the office

INT NINETEENTH FLOOR - DAY

The party has picked up tempo On top of the desks Sylvia
is doing a mock strip tease -- without taking any clothes
off There is hollering drinking and clapping all around her

Bud moves past the floor show paying no attention Kirkeby
spots him detaches himself from the cheering section around
Sylvia
KIRKEBY
Where you going Buddy-boy The
partys just starting

(catching up with him)
Listen kid -- give me a break

DISSOLVE TO
INT CHEAP BAR - COLUMBUS AVENUE IN THE SIXTIES - EVENING

It is six oclock and the joint is crowded with customers
having one for the road before joining their families for
Christmas Eve There are men with gaily wrapped packages
small trussed-up Christmas trees a plucked turkey in a
plastic bag Written across the mirror behind the bar in
glittering white letters is HAPPY HOLIDAYS Everybody is in
high spirits laughing it up and toasting each other

Everybody except Bud Baxter He is standing at the bar in
his chesterfield and bowler slightly isolated brooding
over an almost empty martini glass The bartender comes up
sets down a fresh martini with an olive on a toothpick
takes his payment from a pile of bills and coins lying in
front of Bud Bud fishes out the olive adds it to half a
dozen other impaled olives neatly arranged in fan shape on
the counter He is obviously trying to complete the circle

A short rotund man dressed as Santa Claus hurries in from
the street and comes up to the bar beside Bud

SANTA CLAUS
(to bartender)
Hey Charlie -- give me a shot of
bourbon -- and step on it -- my
sleigh is double parked

He laughs uproariously at his own joke nudges Bud with his
elbow Bud stares at him coldly turns back to his martini
The laughter dies in Santa Claus throat He gets his short
of bourbon moves down the bar to find more convivial company

Standing near the end of the curved bar is a girl in her
middle twenties wearing a ratty fur coat Her name is MARGIE
MacDOUGALL she is drinking a Rum Collins through a straw
and she too is alone From a distance she is studying Bud
with interest On the bar in front of her is a container of
straws in paper wrappers She takes one of them out tears
off the end of the paper blows through the straw -- sending
the wrapper floating toward Bud The paper wrapper passes
right in front of Buds nose He doesnt notice it

Margie undaunted lets go with another missile

This time the wrapper lands on the brim of Buds bowler No
reaction Another wrapper comes floating in hits Buds
cheek He never takes his eye off his martini

Margie leaves her place and carrying her handbag and her
empty glass comes up alongside Bud Without a word she
reaches up and removes the wrapper from Buds bowler

MARGIE
You buy me a drink Ill buy you
some music
(sets the glass down)
Rum Collins

Not waiting for an answer she heads for the juke box Bud
looks after her noncommittally then turns to the bartender

BUD
Rum Collins
(indicating martini glass)
And another one of these little
mothers

At the juke box Margie has dropped a coin in and made her
selection The music starts -- ADESTE FIDELIS She rejoins
Bud at the bar just as the bartender is putting down their
drinks in front of them Bud removes the new olive adds it
to the pattern on the counter in front of him They both
drink staring straight ahead For quite a while there is
complete silence between them

MARGIE
(out of nowhere)
You like Castro
(a blank look from Bud)
I mean -- how do you feel about
Castro
BUD
What is Castro

MARGIE
You know that big-shot down in
Cuba with the crazy beard

BUD
What about him

MARGIE
Because as far as Im concerned
hes a no good fink Two weeks ago
I wrote him a letter -- never even
answered me
BUD
That so

MARGIE
All I wanted him to do was let
Mickey out for Christmas

BUD
Who is Mickey

MARGIE
My husband Hes in Havana -- in
jail

BUD

Oh Mixed up in that revolution

MARGIE
Mickey He wouldnt do nothing like
that Hes a jockey They caught
him doping a horse

BUD
Well you cant win ‘em all

They sit there silently for a moment contemplating the
injustices of the world

MARGIE

(to herself)
Twas the night before Christmas
And all through the house
Not a creature was stirring --
Nothing --
No action --
Dullsville

(drinks to Bud)
You married

BUD

MARGIE

MARGIE

A night like this it sort of
spooks you to walk into an empty
apartment

I said I had no family -- I didnt
say I had an empty apartment
They both drink
CUT TO
INT BUDS APARTMENT - EVENING

The living room is dark except for a shaft of light from
the kitchen and the glow of the colored bulbs on a small
Christmas tree in front of the phony fireplace

Hunched up in one corner of the couch is Fran still in her
coat and gloves crying softly Pacing up and down is
Sheldrake His coat and hat are on a chair as are several
Christmas packages On the coffee table are an unopened
bottle of Scotch a couple of untouched glasses and a bowl
of melting ice

SHELDRAKE
(stops and faces Fran)
Come on Fran -- dont be like that

You just going to sit there and
keep bawling

(no answer)

You wont talk to me you wont
tell me whats wrong --

(a new approach)

Look I know you think Im stalling
you But when youve been married

to a woman for twelve years you
dont just sit down at the breakfast
table and say Pass the sugar --

and I want a divorce Its not

that easy

(he resumes pacing

Fran continues crying)
Anyway this is the wrong time The
kids are home from school -- my in-
laws are visiting for the
holidays -- I cant bring it up now

(stops in front of her)

This isnt like you Fran -- you
were always such a good sport --
such fun to be with --

FRAN
(through tears)
Yeah -- thats me The Happy
Idiot -- a million laughs
SHELDRAKE

Well thats more like it At least
youre speaking to me

FRAN
Funny thing happened to me at the
office party today -- I ran into
your secretary -- Miss Olsen You
know -- ring-a-ding-ding I laughed
so much I like to died

SHELDRAKE
Is that whats been bothering
you -- Miss Olsen Thats ancient
history

FRAN
I was never very good at history
Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen
and then there was Miss Rossi --
no she came before -- it was Miss

Koch who came after Miss Olsen --

SHELDRAKE
Now Fran --
FRAN
And just think -- right now theres

some lucky girl in the building
whos going to come after me --

SHELDRAKE
Okay okay Fran I deserve that
But just ask yourself -- why does a

man run around with a lot of girls
Because hes unhappy at home --
because hes lonely thats why --
all that was before you Fran --
Ive stopped running

Fran has taken a handkerchief out of her bag and is dabbing
her eyes

FRAN
How could I be so stupid Youd
think I would have learned by
now -- when youre in love with a
married man you shouldnt wear
mascara

SHELDRAKE
Its Christmas Eve Fran -- lets
not fight

FRAN
Merry Christmas

She hands him a flat wrapped package

SHELDRAKE
What is it

He strips away the wrapping to reveal a long-playing record
The cover reads RICKSHAW BOY - Jimmy Lee Kiang with
Orchestra

SHELDRAKE
Oh Our friend from the Chinese
restaurant Thanks Fran We better
keep it here

FRAN
Yeah we better

SHELDRAKE

I have a present for you I didnt
quite know what to get you --
anyway its a little awkward for
me shopping --

(he has taken out a

money clip detaches

a bill)
-- so heres a hundred dollars --
go out and buy yourself something

He holds the money out but she doesnt move Sheldrake
slips the bill into her open bag

SHELDRAKE
They have some nice alligator bags
at Bergdorfs --

Fran gets up slowly and starts peeling off her gloves
Sheldrake looks at her then glances nervously at his wrist
watch

SHELDRAKE
Fran its a quarter to seven --
and I mustnt miss the train -- if
we hadnt wasted all that time -- I
have to get home and trim the
tree --

Fran has started to remove her coat

FRAN
Okay
(shrugs the coat back on)
I just thought as long as it was
paid for --

SHELDRAKE
(an angry step toward her)
Dont ever talk like that Fran
Dont make yourself out to be cheap

FRAN
A hundred dollars I wouldnt call
that cheap And you must be paying
somebody something for the use of
the apartment --
SHELDRAKE
(grabbing her arms)
Stop that Fran

FRAN
(quietly)
Youll miss your train Jeff

Sheldrake hurriedly puts on his hat and coat gathers up his
packages

SHELDRAKE
Coming

FRAN
You run along -- I want to fix my
face

SHELDRAKE

(heading for the door)
Dont forget to kill the lights
See you Monday

FRAN
Sure Monday and Thursday -- and
Monday again -- and Thursday
again --

SHELDRAKE

(that stops him in
the half-open door)

It wont always be like this
(coming back)

I love you Fran

Holding the packages to one side he tries to kiss her on
the mouth

FRAN
(turning her head)
Careful -- lipstick

He kisses her on the cheek hurries out of the apartment
closing the door Fran stands there for a while blinking
back tears then takes the long-playing record out of its
envelope crosses to the phonograph She puts the record on
starts the machine -- the music is JEALOUS LOVER As it
plays Fran wanders aimlessly around the darkened room her
body wracked by sobs Finally she regains control of herself
and picking up her handbag starts through the bedroom
toward the bathroom

In the bathroom Fran switches on the light puts her bag on
the sink turns on the faucet Scooping up some water she
washes the smeared mascara away then turns the faucet off
picks up a towel As she is drying her face she notices in
the pull-away shaving mirror the magnified reflection of a
vial of pills on the medicine shelf Fran reaches out for
the vial turns it slowly around in her hand The label
reads SECONAL - ONE AT BEDTIME AS NEEDED FOR SLEEP

Fran studies the label for a second then returns the vial
to the shelf She opens her handbag takes out a lipstick
As she does so she sees the hundred dollar bill Sheldrake
left in the bag Her eyes wander back to the vial on the
medicine shelf Then very deliberately she picks up Buds
mouthwash glass removes the two toothbrushes from it turns
on the faucet starts filling the glass with water

MacDougall who are dancing to a slow blues coming from the
juke box Bud is still in his overcoat and bowler and

He polishes off his drink walks out unsteadily The
bartender approaches the dancers

BARTENDER

Bud and Margie ignore him continue dancing -- or rather
swaying limply cheek-to-cheek The bartender crosses to the
juke box pulls the plug out The music stops but not Bud
and Margie -- they continue dancing

BARTENDER

He goes to the front of the bar starts to extinguish the
lights Margie picks up her handbag from the bar and Bud

BUD
Well they havent got me yet baby
Dig up some ice from the kitchen
and lets not waste any time --
preliminary-wise

MARGIE
Im with you lover

She takes the bowl of melted ice Bud has handed her
disappears into the kitchen As Bud starts to remove his
coat he becomes aware of a scratching noise from the
phonograph He crosses to it sees that the needle is stuck
in the last groove of a long-playing record

Bud lifts the record off examines it curiously then puts
it aside and substitutes the cha cha record As the music
starts he dances over to the coat-rack beside the door
hangs up his chesterfield and bowler He turns back into the
room still dancing suddenly spots Frans gloves on the
coffee table He picks up the gloves looks around for some
convenient place to get rid of them Moving over to the
bedroom door he opens it tosses the gloves toward the bed
inside He shuts the door starts to turn away freezes ina
delayed reaction to something he saw inside He quickly
opens the door again looks

Sprawled across the bed on top of the bedspread is Fran
The light from the bathroom falls across her She is fully
dressed still in her coat and apparently asleep

Bud steps into the bedroom closing the door behind him
walks over to Fran

BUD

All right Miss Kubelik -- get up
Its past checking-out time and
the hotel management would
appreciate it if you would get the
hell out of here

(Fran doesnt stir)
Look Miss Kubelik I used to like

you -- I used to like you a lot --
but its all over between us -- so
beat it -- O-U-T -- out

(no reaction he puts

a hand on her

shoulder shakes her)
Come on -- wake up

She doesnt respond But something falls out of her hand

rolls across the bed Bud picks it up looks at it -- it is
his sleeping-pill vial now uncapped and empty
BUD

(a hoarse whisper)
Oh my God
For a second he is paralyzed Then he drops the vial grabs
Fran lifts her into a sitting position on the bed shakes
her violently

BUD
Miss Kubelik Miss Kubelik

Frans head droops to one side like a rag dolls Bud lets
go of her rushes out

In the living room the phonograph is still cha cha-ing away
Bud dashes to the phone picks it up Then it occurs to him
that he doesnt know whom to call and he hangs up Out of
the kitchen comes Margie with a bowlful of ice cubes

MARGIE
I broke a nail trying to get the
ice-tray out You ought to buy
yourself a new refrigerator

Bud not listening runs past her to the hall door and out

MARGIE
(calling after him)

INT SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT

ringing the doorbell and pounding with his fist

BUD

The door opens and Dr Dreyfuss stands there sleepily
pulling on his beaten bathrobe

BUD
(words tumbling over
each other)

Theres a girl in my place -- she
took some sleeping pills -- you

her up

DR DREYFUSS

He disappears from the doorway

BUD
Hurry up Doc

Bud turns and runs back into his apartment

INT APARTMENT - NIGHT

fixing the drinks The cha cha music is still going Bud
comes flying in heads for the bedroom

MARGIE

feet

of her hand)

BUD
(thrusting the fur
coat at her)
The partys over

MARGIE
Whats the matter Did I do
something wrong

BUD
(easing her toward door)
Its an emergency -- see you some

Dr Dreyfuss comes hurrying in carrying his medical bag He
stops bewildered by the sound of music and the sight of a
wide-awake girl in the apartment

BUD
Not this one --
(pointing to the bedroom)
-- in there Doc

Dr Dreyfuss proceeds into the bedroom

MARGIE
Say whats going on here anyway

BUD

toward the door)

Bud shoves the shoes at her takes a bill out of his wallet
hands it to her

BUD
Here -- find yourself a phone booth
and call your husband in Havana

MARGIE
You bet I will And when I tell him
how you treated me hell push your
face in
(he shoves her
through the open door)
You fink

Bud slams the door shut starts toward the bedroom Halfway
there he becomes aware that the cha cha record is still on
He detours to the phonograph switches it off continues
into the bedroom

In the bedroom the overhead light is on and Dr Dreyfuss
is working on the unconscious Fran He has removed her coat
and is shining a flashlight into her eyes examining her
pupils Bud approaches the bed worriedly

BUD
She going to be all right Doc

DR DREYFUSS
How many pills were in that bottle

BUD
It was half-full -- about a dozen
or so You going to have to take
her to the hospital

Dr Dreyfuss ignores him Out of his medical bag he takes a
stomach tube with a rubber funnel at the end Then he starts
to lift Fran off the bed

DR DREYFUSS
Help me will you
Between them they get Fran into an upright position

DR DREYFUSS
Into the bathroom

They half-carry half-drag Frans limp form toward the
bathroom

BUD
What are you going to do Doc

DR DREYFUSS
Get that stuff out of her stomach --
if it isnt too late You better
put some coffee on -- and pray

Bud starts away as Dr Dreyfuss takes Fran into the bathroom

Bud loses no time getting into the kitchen He fills an
aluminum kettle with water strikes a match lights the gas
burner puts the kettle on Then he takes a jar of instant
coffee and a chipped coffee mug out of the cupboard shakes
an excessive portion of coffee into the mug sticks a spoon
in it He watches the kettle for a moment mops his brow
with a handkerchief then starts back toward the bedroom

Bud crosses the bedroom to the half-open door of the
bathroom looks in anxiously From inside come the sounds of
a coughing spasm and running water Bud turns away undoes
his tie and collar paces the bedroom floor Something on

the night table attracts his attention -- resting against
the base of the lamp is a sealed envelope Bud picks it
up -- on it in Frans handwriting is one word JEFF He

turns the letter over in his hand trying to decide what to
do with it

Dr Dreyfuss emerges from the bathroom carrying a pale
still unconscious Fran Bud quickly conceals the suicide
note behind his back

DR DREYFUSS
Bring my bag

He lugs Fran into the living room Bud stashes the letter in
his back pocket picks up the medical bag follows them

In the living room Dr Dreyfuss lowers Fran into a chair
Her chin falls to her chest Dreyfuss takes the bag from
Bud fishes out a hypodermic syringe draws 2 ccs froma
bottle of picrotoxin

DR DREYFUSS
Roll up her right sleeve

Bud does so Dr Dreyfuss hands the hypodermic to Bud
searches for a spot for the injection
DR DREYFUSS
Nice veins

He swabs the spot with alcohol takes the hypodermic back
from Bud

DR DREYFUSS
Want to tell me what happened

BUD
I dont know -- I mean -- I wasnt
here -- you see -- we had some
words earlier -- nothing serious
really -- what you might calla
lovers quarrel --

DR DREYFUSS
(making off-scene injection)
So you went right out and picked
yourself up another dame

BUD
Something like that

DR DREYFUSS
You know Baxter youre a real
cutie-pie -- yes you are

Bud just stands there taking it Fran stirs slightly and
from her parched lips comes a low moan Dr Dreyfuss grabs
her by the hair lifts her head up

DR DREYFUSS
If youd come home half an hour
later you would have had quite a
Christmas present

With his free hand Dr Dreyfuss slaps Fran viciously across
the face Bud winces Dreyfuss still holding Fran by the
hair takes a box of ammonia ampules out of his bag He
crushes one of the ampules in his hand passes it under her
nose Fran tries to turn her head away Dreyfuss slaps her
again hard crushes another ampule repeats the process

Bud is watching tensely From the kitchen comes the whistle
of the boiling kettle but Bud pays no attention

DR DREYFUSS
Get the coffee

Bud hurries into the kitchen He turns off the gas pours
the boiling water into the mug with the instant coffee
stirs it From off come the sounds of more slapping and
some moaning Bud carries the coffee out

In the living room Dr Dreyfuss is working another ammonia
ampule under Frans nose Her eyes start fluttering Dreyfuss
takes the coffee mug from Bud forces it between Frans

lips pours coffee into her mouth Fran resists
instinctively half the coffee dribbling over her chin and
dress but Dr Dreyfuss keeps at it

DR DREYFUSS

Bud complies promptly -- pulls up the shades opens the
windows wide

Bud throws Dr Dreyfuss a look as if to say that Frans
mind still wasnt functioning properly

BUD
(to Fran)

office party together --

FRAN
Oh yes -- office party -- Miss

BUD

Please -- just let me sleep

DR DREYFUSS

You cant sleep

(shaking her)
Come on Fran -- open your eyes

(to Bud)
Lets get her walking Weve got to
keep her awake for the next couple
of hours

They lift her from the chair and each draping one of her
arms over his shoulder they start to walk her up and down
the room

DR DREYFUSS
(urging Fran on)
Now walk Fran One two three
four -- one two three four --
thats the idea -- left right
left right -- now we turn -- one
two three four --

At first Frans feet just drag along the floor between them
But gradually as Dr Dreyfuss voice continues droning
hypnotically she falls into the rhythm of it repeating the
words after him and putting her weight on her feet

DR DREYFUSS

Left right left right -- walk
walk walk -- one two three
four -- turn -- left right left
right -- now you got it --

DISSOLVE TO
INT THE APARTMENT - DAWN

Through the bedroom window comes the first faint light of
dawn Fran has been put to bed by an exhausted Dr Dreyfuss
She is in her slip and Dreyfuss is just drawing the blanket
over her Her eyes are closed and she is moaning fitfully
Watching from the doorway is Bud in shirtsleeves now weary
and disheveled

DR DREYFUSS
Shell sleep on and off for the
next twenty-four hours Of course
shell have a dandy hangover when
she wakes up --

BUD
Just as long as shes okay

DR DREYFUSS
(massaging his calves)
These cases are harder on the
doctor than on the patient I ought
to charge you by the mile

They have now moved out into the living room where the
overhead light and the Christmas tree bulbs are still on

DR DREYFUSS
Any of that coffee left

BUD
Sure

He goes into the kitchen Dr Dreyfuss takes a small notebook
with a fountain pen clipped to it out of his bag sinks down
on the couch

DR DREYFUSS
How do you spell her last name

BUD
(from kitchen)

Bud appears from the kitchen stirring the coffee powder
a cup of hot water

BUD
(apprehensive)
Why do you want to know Doc You
dont have to report this do you

DR DREYFUSS
Its regulations

BUD

(setting the coffee down)
She didnt mean it Doc -- it was
an accident -- she had a little too
much to drink and -- she didnt
know what she was doing -- there
was no suicide note or anything --
believe me Doc Im not thinking
about myself --

DR DREYFUSS
(sipping the hot coffee)
Arent you

BUD
Its just that shes got a family --
and theres the people in the
office -- look Doc cant you
forget youre a doctor -- lets
just say youre here as a neighbor --

DR DREYFUSS
(a long look at Bud)
Well as a doctor I guess I cant
prove it wasnt an accident
(closes notebook)
But as your neighbor Id like to
kick your keester clear around the
block

(indicating coffee)
Mind if I cool this off

He uncaps the bottle of Scotch pours a large slug into his

coffee

BUD
Help yourself
DR DREYFUSS

(taking a big gulp of

the spiked coffee)
I dont know what you did to that
girl in there -- and dont tell

He walks out closing the door after him Bud dejectedly
turns off the overhead light kicks out the plug of the
Christmas tree lights trudges into the bedroom

Fran is fast asleep Bud picks up her dress gets a hanger
drapes the dress over it hangs it from the door An early
morning chill has invaded the room and Bud switches an the
electric blanket to keep Fran warm Then he slumps into a
chair beside the bed looks at Fran compassionately The
light on the dial of the electric blanket glows in the
grayish room Bud just sits there watching Fran

to Buds apartment puffing asthmatically She seems quite
angry as she arrives at the door and rings the bell There

Finally the door opens a crack and Bud peers out He looks
like a man who has slept in his clothes -- rumpled bleary-
eyed unshaven

INT LIVING ROOM - SHELDRAKE HOUSE - DAY

The decor is split-level Early American There is a huge
Christmas tree and a jumble of presents open gift boxes
and discarded wrappings

Sheldrake and his two sons TOMMY and JEFF JR are squatting
on the floor testing a Cape Canaveral set the kids got for
Christmas Sheldrake is in a brand new dressing gown with a
manufacturers tag still dangling from it and the boys are
in pajamas and astronauts helmets As for the Cape Canaveral
set it is a miniature layout of block-houses launching
pads and assorted space-missiles Tommy has his finger on
the button controlling one of the rockets

SHELDRAKE
(counting down)
7-6-5-4-3-2-1 -- let her rip

Tommy presses the button and a spring sends the rocket
toward the ceiling Just then the phone in the entrance
hall starts ringing

JEFF JR
Ill get it

He hurries to the phone

TOMMY
Hey Dad -- why dont we put a fly
in the nose cone and see if we can
bring it back alive

SHELDRAKE
Its a thought

TOMMY
Maybe we should send up two flies --
and see if theyll propagate in
orbit

SHELDRAKE
See if theyll what

TOMMY
Propagate -- you know multiply --
baby flies

SHELDRAKE
Oh -- oh

JEFF JR

(coming back from the phone)

his back toward the living room speaks in a low voice

SHELDRAKE

From the stairway beyond him comes

MRS SHELDRAKES VOICE

Sheldrake turns from the phone Halfway down the stairs is
Mrs Sheldrake in a quilted house-robe

SHELDRAKE
(a nice recovery)
One of our employees had an
accident -- I dont know why they
bother me with these things on
Christmas Day
(into phone)
Yes Baxter -- just how serious is

Out of the corner of his eye he watches Mrs Sheldrake come
down the stairs pass behind him on the way to the living

room

BUD - ON PHONE

BUD
Well it was touch and go there for
a while -- but shes sleeping it

He glances through the half-open door toward the sleeping
Fran

BUD
I thought maybe youd like to be
here when she wakes up

SHELDRAKE - ON PHONE

SHELDRAKE
Thats impossible
(an apprehensive look
toward the living room)
Youll have to handle this situation
yourself -- as a matter of fact
Im counting on you --

INT THE APARTMENT - DAY

BUD
(into phone)
Yes sir -- I understand
(taking Frans letter
out of his pocket)

She left a note -- you want me to
open it and read it to you
(a beat)

Well it was just a suggestion --
no you dont have to worry about
that Mr Sheldrake -- I kept your
name out of it so therell be no
trouble police-wise or newspaper-
wise --
As Bud continues talking on the phone Fran in the bedroom
opens her eyes looks around vaguely trying to figure out
where she is She sits up in bed winces holds her head in
her hands -- she has a fierce hangover

BUD
(into phone)
-- you see the doctor hes a

friend of mine -- we were very
lucky in that respect -- actually
he thinks shes my girl -- no he

just jumped to the conclusion --
around here Im known as quite a
ladies man --

In the bedroom Fran becoming aware of Buds voice crawls
out of bed and holding on to the furniture moves unsteadily
toward the living room door

BUD
(into phone)
-- of course were not out of the

woods yet -- sometimes they try it
again -- yes sir Ill do my
best -- it looks like itll be a

couple of days before shes fully
recovered and I may have a little
problem with the landlady --

Behind him Fran appears in the bedroom doorway barefooted
and in her slip She leans groggily against the door post
trying to focus on Bud and to concentrate on what hes saying

BUD
(into phone)

-- all right Mr Sheldrake Ill
keep her in my apartment as long as

I can -- any sort of message you
want me to give her -- well Ill
think of something -- goodbye Mr
Sheldrake

He hangs up the phone slowly

Bud turns around sees her standing there on rubbery legs

FRAN

He leads her back into the bedroom

FRAN

He gently takes the pad and pencil away from her

FRAN

BUD
Well for one thing you cant

spell And secondly -- if you did
something like that -- youd hate
yourself

FRAN

(fighting back tears)
I dont like myself very much anyway

his shoulder He turns finds himself face to face with Karl
Matuschka who is standing grimly in the doorway

MATUSCHKA
(grabbing him)
Look Buddy-boy -- if there wasnt
a lady present Id clobber you

FRAN
(separating them)
All right Karl -- Ill get dressed

She exits into the bedroom removing her dress from the

door and closing it Matuschka leans against the wall
beside the hall door eyeing Bud truculently Bud raises a
finger to remonstrate with him -- then breaks into a nervous
ingratiating smile

BUD
Care for a martini Champagne
(Matuschka continues
glaring at him)
How about a little spaghetti with
meat sauce Made it myself
He gestures with the martini glass
over his shirtfront

(Matuschka just scowls)
Your sister-in-law sure is
terrific --

switching abruptly)
Must be murder driving a cab in New
York -- I mean with all that

crash Fran pulls Matuschka away from him
