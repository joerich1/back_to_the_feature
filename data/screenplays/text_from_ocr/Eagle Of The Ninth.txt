A flaming torch slams down on a hut roof

DISSOLVE TO

EXT FARMSTEAD SOUTH WEST ENGLAND - DAY

Veteran LEGIONARIES march between the huts of a small
farmstead torching everything They duck in through
doorways hauling out anyone inside Terrified LOCALS plead
or run for cover

FIFTEEN YEARS LATER

A gaggle of CELT BOYS dart about shouting insults like
barking puppies They follow ten LOCAL MEN being frog-marched
to some trees by armed LEGIONARIES Fear in their faces No
quarter given They disappear into the copse

Emerging from the largest of the burning huts LEGIONARIES
dump anything of value into a waiting cart - beautifully
woven cloth sacks of grain metal work

In the distance through the trees we see the first of the
LOCAL MEN being executed on their knees

EXT ROMAN ROAD — DAY

kh COHORT of leather-clad auxiliaries marches down a Roman

road their Standard glittering in their midst Pristine
uniforms sparkle in the morning sun
At their head walks the Pilus Prior Centurion the Cohort
Commander MARCUS AQUILA Nineteen the woxld at his feet he
carries all the confidence of youth with graceful ease

Something up ahead makes him stop He raises his hand The
COHORT and its baggage train halts

In the distance smoke billows up from the burning farmstead

MARCUS stares for a moment face expressionless Then with a
sweep of his hand he orders his men on

EXT FARMSTEAD — DAY

Further down the road MARCUS and his COHORT near the
farmstead They pass LEGIONARIES salting a field In uniforms
filthy with mud the soldiers fan out across the length of
the field a bullock cart in their midst loaded up with
‘white grain’

MARCUS and his COHORT reach the section of road running
directly past the burning farmstead They continue on smoke
billowing around them As they march past the fresh-faced
COHORTS stare at the veteran LEGIONARIES leoting and burning

MARCUS catches a glimpse of the LOCAL MEN being executed in
the copse - a sword slashing down on a neck the body
toppling forward

For a second we register a glimmer of shock on MARCUS’s
face The level of brutality here is something new to him

Meanwhile the gaggle of CELT BOYS are getting braver One of
them picks up a rock and chucks it at a LEGIONARY Spinning
round he grabs the child and raises his sword for the kill

MARCUS
(with quiet authority)
Leave him soldier

The LEGIONARY stares at the young Centurion He drops the
CELT BOY who races away Other LEGIONARIES turn and stare

MARCUS marches on

EXT FORT - ISCA DUMNONIORUM - DAY

The Roman fort of Isca Dumnoniorum dominates the hillside
overlooking a small satellite village A Roman road leads out
from the fort slashed across the countryside like a cut
EXT FORT - ISCA DUMNONICRUM - DAY

MARCUS and his COHORT near the fort watched by war-weary
LEGIONARIES from the parapet above The great gates swing
open and they march inside

EXTINT FORT - ISCA DUMNONIORUM - DAY

The LEGIONARIES stare down on the new arrivals marching into
the main courtyard

A grizzled Centurion LUTORIUS steps up MARCUS salutes

MARCUS
Marcus Aquila Pilus Prior
Centurion of the Fourth Gaulish
Auxiliaries come to relieve this
garrison

LUTORIUS

Centurion Lutorius Commander of
the Dacian Horse

MARCUS
Where’s the garrison commander
LUTORIUS
He left this morning sir Couldnt
wait to get away

A look from MARCUS

EXTINT FORT ISCA DUMNONIORUM - DAY

A series of angles on LUTORIUS showing MARCUS round the
garrison - a small square of rectangular buildings around a
colonnaded courtyard

LUTORIUS
The cohort Standard and officers
are all housed here the rest of
the men across the yard

They pass another ranker Centurion (GALBA) with two JUNIOR
OFFICERS They stop talking and salute MARCUS returns the
salute The OFFICERS watch him walk away

GALBA
(mutters disparagingly)
So that’s Fabius Aquila’s son
(beat)
He’s a boy

MARCUS heard that He smiles to himself and continues on
INT FORT ISCA DUMNONIORUM - COMMANDER’S QUARTERS — DAY

The commander’s quarters comprise a sleeping cell a polished
oak pay-chest a writing desk a cabinet for the record rolls
and a rather tasteless bronze pedestal lamp Just outside the
door is a rose bush in a pot The buds just appearing

LUTORIUS scoops up a duty-roster and a rope of keys He hands
them to MARCUS

LUTORIUS
Duty-roster and the keys to the
pay-chest

MARCUS

You don’t have a paymaster

LUTORIUS
Were too small a garrison
Unfortunately that job falls to
ou
(beat)

As you can probably tell there’s
been a problem with the latrines
but we have someone working on it

MARCUS
(smiles)
Unsuccessfully

LUTORIUS
(smiles back)
So far
(off a gust of wind)
The west wind I’m afraid I can’t
change

MARCUS glances into the sleeping cell

MARCUS
What do you do for sport here

LUTORIUS
Not much Every two weeks or so the
men are allowed into the village
for “rest and recreation” Other
than that we stay in the fort

MARCUS
You don’t hunt

LUTORIUS
We don’t encourage the men to
fraternize with the enemy
MARCUS
(nicely deadpan)
Just to sleep with them

LUTORIUS acknowledges that with a thin smile He moves to the
door then turns

LUTORIUS
May I ask why you chose Britain for
your first tour of duty

MARCUS
I heard the hunting was good

LUTORIUS
(pointedly)
Don’t you have a family connection

MARCUS
I’ve an uncle here in Calleva
though I’ve never met hin

INT FORT - ISCA DUMNONIORUM - COMMANDERS QUARTERS - DAY

MARCUS hangs up his sword and begins unpacking his trunk He
brings out some official-looking decuments some jars of
garum a brooch of the ged Mithras and a small carved wooden
bird which he hangs with particular care beside his bed

EXT ISCA DUMNONIORUM - FORTROAD - DAY

MARCUS and LUTORIUS ride out of the fort with a GUARD OF
DACIAN HORSE All the way they’re followed by a gaggle of
third world LOCALS selling fruit drinks cloth anything
they can flog

A flap of wings makes MARCUS glance up

High above him a kite flutters crow-black against the sky
The same CELT BOY whom MARCUS saved the day before runs the
kite along the side of the road MARCUS and the CELT BOY
stare at each other The kite wings flutter and snap

EXT ISCA DUMNONIORUM - VILLAGE - DAY

MARCUS LUTORIUS and the GUARD OF DACTAN HORSE ride through
the fort’s satellite village a shanty-town on the fringe of
Empire

LUTORIUS
Most of the time we rub along
They sell us food we take their
taxes If they attack us we punish
them They know the rules

(MORE )
LUTORIUS (CONTD)
(beat)
But you once let a holy man into
their heads and they stop thinking at
all It’s as if punishment has no
meaning The only meaning is war

MARCUS
So if the priests get into their
heads what are they fighting for

LUTORIUS
Nothing They’re keeping faith with their
gods We’re just the unbelievers

Somewhere impossible to tell where - a male voice calls out
in prayer A single note rising and falling on the air

At the same moment they round a corner and meet a young
Celt CRADOC leading two horses CRADOC is lean athletic
and composed - compelling and distant Three British chariots
stand outside his hut half-built or ready for repair

LUTORIUS (CONT’D)
Cradoc Over here

In his own time CRADOC turns and looks at them
LUTORIUS (CONTD)
Cradoc’s a horse-dealer He does work
for the fort

MARCUS nods at the chariots

MARCUS
Youre a charioteer
CRADOC
I am accounted the best in my tribe
MARCUS
Our racing chariots in Rome are
smaller
CRADOC
The Commander also is a charioteer
MARCUS
I am accounted the best in my Legion
CRADOC
British chariots are not as easy to
ride
MARCUS

Im here to prove you wrong
MARCUS and CRADOC hold each other’s level gaze

EXT CORNFIELD EARLY MORNING

A few days later early morning mist enshrouds a beautiful
blue cornfield

MARCUS stands on a British chariot four harnessed horses
steaming in the cold air To his side stands CRADOC

A pause

MARCUS cracks the whip With a jerk the chariot moves off
At first he finds the unfamiliarity difficult He checks
himself Readjusts his stance

In the distance - a still figure against the sky - CRADOC
watches

MARCUS begins speeding up He feels the earth thumping upward
through the base of the chariot Adrenaline begins to pump

MARCUS builds to a gallop Hooves thunder under him The
cornfield flashes green-blue to his side He turns the
chariot for the final run then - without warning - he steers
the horses straight towards a forest cf trees

Close-up on CRADOC stiffening at the Romans audacity

EXT FOREST - EARLY MORNING

The chariot sweeps through the trees at full gallop dipping
and twisting with each check MARCUS makes to the reins

EXT CORNFIELD - EARLY MORNING

The chariot explodes through the forest-edge and back into
the field

Slamming high and wide we take in MARCUS crouched low on
the chariot reins held high whip slewing the air animal
and machine cutting a perfect line through the blue field

With one expert manoeuvre MARCUS rears up to CRADOC reining
the chariot to a halt Silence The two young men - Celt and
Roman - hold each others gaze

MARCUS
Well
CRADOC
The Commander begins to be a
charioteer

EXT ISCA DUMNONIORUM - VILLAGE - EARLY MORNING
The thunder of hooves Pure adrenalin

MARCUS is at full gallop leaning low in the saddle spear
poised Below him the boar races through the undergrowth

MARCUS hurls the spear and lets out a cry of triumph He
leaps off his horse knife out for the kill

CRADOC
Look out

MARCUS turns too late The speared boar is charging towards
him horns down In a flash CRADOC hurls his knife striking
the boar in the neck The animal collapses only feet from
where MARCUS is standing

A shocked beat MARCUS turns to CRADOC smiling gratefuily

pulling the dead boar out of the undergrowth

CRADOC walks MARCUS into his hut A line of spears stand
against the wall newly made CRADOC nods MARCUS forward He

Any except that one

MARCUS gives him a quigzical smile but CRADOC remains

expressionless Replacing the blue-feathered spear MARCUS

picks another one

INT FORT -— OFFICER’S MESS - EARLY MORNING

GALBA LUTORIUS and the other RANKER CENTURIONS eat and talk
GALBA

You mark my words- Marcus
Aquila is tainted

DRUSTLLUS
What are you talking about

GALBA
(giving him a look)
His father’s Fabius Aquila The
man who lost the Ninth Legion

LUTORIUS
Worse than that - he lost the Eagle

GALBA
Unbelievable The Legion’s soul
and standard You just don’t - you
never let that go

The OFFICERS take this in

DRUSILLUS
Somebody tell me - how do five
thousand men simply disappear

PAULUS
Ive heard they’re still roaming the
hillsor they marched as far as the
ice mountains and fell off the edge
of the earth

LUTORIUS
My sergeant says that if you stand
on the hilltop at Are-Cluta in
Caledonia when the moon is full
you can hear the ghosts of the
Legionaries scream

GALBA
I’m telling you Marcus Aquila’s a
bad omen

The door opens on MARCUS holding his spear The room goes
silent Did he hear that If he did he betrays nothing

MARCUS
Morning

GALBA nods at the spear deadpan

GALBA
Nice spear sir

MARCUS
(smiling)
I won a wager

MARCUS puts the spear aside and joins them An awkward
silence He turns to LUTORIUS
il

MARCUS (CONT’D
The delivery of grain from Curinham
hasn’t arrived I want you to send
out a cohort to investigate

LUTORIUS
I wouldn’t worry sir One day late
is nothing in Britain

MARCUS
Send one out

GALBA
Do you really think that’s wise
sir There’s a lot of unrest out
there We’ve had to make four
punishment raids in the last month

MARCUS
(calmly)
I want you to send out a cohort
(beat)
The men need to eat too
Silence GALBA gives LUTORIUS a look Feeling suddenly self-
conscious PAULUS lowers the hank cf meat poised at his lips

From the doorway of his quarters MARCUS watches a COHORT OF

CAVALRY march out of the fort A moment of doubt then he
turns and goes back to work

INT FORT - MARCUSS QUARTERS - NIGHT

MARCUS prepares for bed

He‘’s about to enter his sleeping cell when the faintest
shushing noise makes him stop He walks over to the window
Pulling back the leather curtain he psers into the
blackness listening Nothing He lets the curtain flap back

With preternatural speed the camera glides over the surface

MARCUS jolts upright wide awake

EXT FORT - PARAPET - NIGHT

Hauling a cloak over his nightshirt MARCUS hurries towards
the dim light of the watchtower Three LEGIONARIES spring to
their feet and salute

MARCUS
Wake Lutorius

One of the men hurries away MARCUS stares over the parapet
There it is again The faint swish-swish of wind in grass

MARCUS (CONTD)
Can you hear it

LEGIONARY
Sixr-

He holds up his hand Through the dark they hear the faint
grunt of cattle MARCUS swears softly under his breath

LUTORIUS races up cloak hauled roughly over his nightshirt

MARCUS
It seems I may have called you out
under false pretences

LUTORIUS
You heard something

MARCUS
Cattle most likely

LUTORIUS peers into the blackness Faint but clear we hear
the shushing sound then it stops

MARCUS (CONTD)
There That Hear it

LUTORIUS nods Both men stand there staring intently over
the parapet

MARCUS (CONTD)
(under his breath)
Damn the dark
(beat)
Should I call the men to arms

LUTORIUS
Depends If it’s just cattle they won’t
thank you

MARCUS

Better angry than dead Call them out

INT FORT - MILITARY QUARTERS — NIGHT

A series of visceral fast-cut close-ups A LEGIONARY races
down the dormitory men twist out of bed haul on armour
short swords boots everything fast and jagged

EXT FORT COURTYARD - NIGHT

A line of LEGIONARIES rush out into the courtyard fitting
helmets as they go One of them nicks the underside of his
chin with the buckle His mate races past slapping his
helmet on as he runs

LEGIONARY 1
Bloody buckle cuts

LEGIONARY 2
(holding up his helmet)
What do you expect Made in Rumania

EXT FORT PARAPETCOURTYARD - NIGHT

LEGIONARIES pour cnto the parapet taking up their positions
As each man hits his post a weird silence settles Slowly
the whole fort goes still

MARCUS stands in the courtyard a lone figure in full armour
his men at battle stations all around him The seconds tick
by Nobody moves Feeling his nerves kick in MARCUS adjusts
the buckle on his helmet He winces glances up LUTORIUS is
on the watchtower He’s about to turn away when his shield-
arm flies up involuntarily and a spear smashes into it

ALi along the parapet like a silent uprush of shadows the
CELTS attack For a moment the shock of the assault renders
attackers and defenders gilent then

MARCUS
Sound Arms

A trumpet blasts through the silence and everything roars

CUT TO

EXT FORT - PARAPET - NIGHT

Close-up on MARCUS scrambling up the parapet Staying right
on his shoulder we experience the attack not as an epic but
as a physical and emotional assault on one persons senses
raw shadow-looming chaotic

He hits the parapet at a sprint Smack He wheels round on a
CELT rearing out of the dark Short-sword out

One quick stab Someone screams A LEGIONARY thumps to his
knees spewing blood Another CELT rears over the parapet
MARCUS spins Lunges Misses him Skids back Ducks an axe-
swing Shoots out two quick stabs One Two The CELT
collapses over the parapet Dry mouth Heart pounding He
races on Suddenly the sky ignites A fire-brush flies over
the ledge Then another Then another MARCUS stamps wildly
at them sparks flying A warning shout from behind He spins
round Two CELTS are charging him Shield up Hard punch One
of the CELTS reels left A smack to his armoured shoulder He
twists in agony The shield spins out of his hand LUTORIUS
bangs up alongside

LUTORIUS
(yelling)
Back to back

MARCUS slams round back smacked up against LUTORIUS Another
wave of CELTS flies over the wall MARCUS grabs for his
fallen shield His fingers scrabble madly for a purchase on
the leather handle then lock into place He punches wildly
into the darkness and

EXT FORT - PARAPETCOURTYARD - NIGHT

MARCUS races among his men yelling encouragement filling
gaps in the line carrying off wounded - each moment shot
through with purpose as if the full force of his leadership
has been released by the battie

EXT FORT — COURTYARDPARAPET - DAWN

Through thick mist streaks of dawn light reveal the chaotic
courtyard Dead and wounded lie amid burned-out fire-brush
abandoned arms and spilled grain from the upturned cart

MARCUS helps carry a wounded LEGIONARY to the FORT SURGEON
Turning back he glances at his exhausted men sitting about
the yard He gives them the thumbs up grinning The MEN
smile back A few call out He’s blooded now One of them

MARCUS
(turning to the Quartermaster)
Breakfast Now And double their rations

A cheer from the men The QUARTERMASTER grumbles off
LUTORIUS approaches He and MARCUS climb back up the parapet

MARCUS (CONTD)
(suddenly remembering)
What happened to the cohort of cavalry
LUTORIUS’S FACE He clearly thinks they’ve no chance

MARCUS (CONT’D)
How long can we hoid out

LUTORIUS
With luck several days

MARCUS
Keep a fire burning on the roof
Once the mist clears well send up
a smoke column

They reach the watchtower What they see halts them in their
tracks

Below the fort - seeming to rise cut of the mist - a vast
army of CELTS forms before their eyes They swarm around the
single figure of a safron-coated DRUID The priest stands on
a chariot the still centre amid a storm of warriors Even at
this distance his presence is palpable An elemental sense
of menace underscored by the beat of invisible drums

MARCUS stares at the DRUID furious with himself

MARCUS (CONT’D)
Fetch me our best archer

A LEGIONARY races away LUTORIUS and MARCUS stand together
staring at the enemy massing in front of them

An ARCHER races up

MARCUS (CONT’D)
See the priest
(beat)
Kill him

A thin smile from LUTORIUS His young commander is hardening
fast

The ARCHER loads his bow takes aim and fires MARCUS watches
the arrow fly straight and true But the moment it strikes
the holy man it appears to sail right through him MARCUS
blinks in shock

WATCHTOWER OS
Sir

MARCUS looks up There behind the line of CELTS just
emerging on the brow of the hill is the COHORT OF CAVALRY
MARCUS stares out urging them back with all his being

MARCUS
(under his breath)
Turn aroundturn aroundgo back

Realizing their situation the COHORT OF CAVALRY begins
turning for a retreat But before they can fall back another
LINE OF CELTS emerges on the horizon line behind them
They’re surrounded With no option but to push on they
prepare to engage

MARCUS stares grim-faced He turns and starts walking down
to the men mustering at the gate LUTORIUS follows

LUTORIUS
It’s not your fault You did the
right thing

MARCUS
Im not leaving them to die
(beat)
Muster a squadron and hold them at

the gate
MARCUS begins arming himself to engage

LUTORIUS shouts the order and the hastily mustered SQUADRON
begins forming in the shadow of the great gates - checking
weapons tightening helmet straps shield grips spears

LUTORIUS turns back to MARCUS

LUTORIUS
Sir
(beat)
Let me lead them sir

MARCUS
It was my decision It’s my
responsibility to bring them back
(beat)
Open the doors

The huge bars are drawn back and the great doors begin
swinging apart With each inching second the roar of the
battle closes in louder and louder

MARCUS steps to the front ready to lead his men out He can
hear some of them offering up murmured prayers He glances
skyward Instinctively he whispers fast

MARCUS (CONTD)

Mithras god of the sun father of
our fathers let me not bring
misfortune to my LegionMithras
god of the sun father of our
fathers accept whatever sacrifice
that I may not bring misfortune to

The gates are open There’s about a hundred yards clear
between them and the battle between the CELTS and the CAVALRY

CHARGE

EXT FORT - ISCA DUMNONIORUM - DAY

From high over the fort gate we look down on the
extraordinary sight of the tiny SQUADRON OF LEGIONARIES
roaring out of the fort towards the mass of CELTS

EXT SQUADRON — DAY

Closé-up on MARCUS his whole body joiting at full sprint
Ahead of him he can see the battle raging As the first
CELTS turn to engage them he yells out

MARCUS
FORM TESTUDO

Suddenly - like a steel sky - the shields shoot up and the
squadron is transformed into a mailed wedge The move is so
fast and unexpected that their momentum smashes them through
the stunned line of CELTS and up to the COHORT OF CAVALRY
still fighting to break through on the other side

MARCUS (CONT’D)
BREAK TESTUDO

The SQUADRON burst out of formation fanning out into a rough
v-like corridor of escape for the CAVALRY

MARCUS (CONTD)
OUT SWORDS
(drawing his sword)
CAESAR CAESAR

SQUADRON
CAESAR CAESAR

Another smack of energy as the entire SQUADRON draw swords
battling to maintain the escape-corridor The CELTS are
about to re-assault whenthe strangest thing A British
war-horn rings out and they fall back

MARCUS blinks in surprise

EYT FORT - ISCA DUMNONIORUM —- DAY

Cutting wide we see that the ROMANS are now isolated on the
hillside outside the fort Almost instantly a warning
trumpet sounds from the watchtower behind them

MARCUS spins round Then he sees it

Rising over the horizon in a thunder of hooves sweeps a
single breath-taking line of CHARIOTEERS the blades on
their wheels spinning ferociously The sheer speed and
theatre of their approach is awesome

MARCUS
FALL BACK

A trumpet blares out In a desperate scrabble for safety the
SQUADRON begin sprinting for the still-open doors of the
fort From the parapet their mates urge them on screaming
encouragement yelling their names

Close-up on MARCUS falling back with his men He glances
ever his shoulder at the still-separated COHORT OF CAVALRY
The sight of them there fighting impossible odds

Suddenly - aware that his men will die in retreat - MARCUS
swerves aside and turns back on his tracks He stands alone on
the hillside the sole Roman in a field of onrushing chariots
Purely and insanely heroic

In the split-seconds left to him MARCUS tenses for the
spring his whole body absolutely still and focussed

Seeing their Commander’s courage the SQUADRON begins re-
grouping

All MARCUS’s attention is focussed on the lead chariot Even
from this distance he can make out the DRUID standing next
to his rider - saffron coated hair flying out around him
one hand raised to the skies

As it draws nearer the rider looks up
MARCUS freezes

Hes staring straight into the grim face of CRADOC In his
up-raised hand the Celt grips the same blue feathered spear
Marcus saw in his hut

MARCUSS FACE Staring up at CRADOC Before he can take in
the moment’s meaning CRADOC is raising the spear aiming it
straight at him thenMARCUS leaps - sword outstretched -
at the on-coming chariot

His dive carries him straight into CRADOC killing him
instantly The chariot begins rearing out of control then
hits a rock and explodes into the air

A timeless dreamlike angle on the back of a ROMAN OFFICER
and five LEGIONARIES sprinting for their lives through thick

grips the standard of his legion There at the top wings
outstretched is the great metal bird

The Eagle of the Ninth

EXT ROMAN VILLA - GARDENS - DAY

YOUNG MARCUS bursts out from behind a tree brandishing a
sta

wooden sword He slows te a halt and stares

eling in the shade of a branch his FATHER is carefully
carving a tiny wooden bird With wings outstretched it
resembles a rough copy of the great Eagle His father lifts
the little bird into the sky MARCUS watches it gripped in
the emerald-ringed HAND swooping this way and that

EXT FOREST - CALEDONIA - DAY

Ancther hallucinatory close-up flash of the Eagle of the
Ninth clenched in the OFFICER’s emerald-ringed fist It
jerks wildly about as he runs for his life

BET ROMAN VILLA DAY

YCUNG MARCUS stares up at the silhouette of his FATHER on
horseback dressed in the magnificent uniform of Legionary
Cohort Further off other CAVALRY OFFICERS await their
commander

Bending down out of the sun FATHER kisses YOUNG MARCUS on
the forehead and hands him the little bird smiling softly

FATHER
The bird is charmed If you speak to it

I will hear you wherever I am

YOUNG MARCUS
(staring into his father’s eyes)
Wherever you are

Their fingers remain linked over the bird The only sign of
emotion his FATHER can bear to show is the merest stroke of
the boy’s hand He sits back into the saddle Blinding
sunlight reduces him once more to a silhouette

Stepping close to his MOTHER YOUNG MARCUS watches his FATHER
ride away He glances at his mother Tears run down her cheeks

but she holds herself still Courage drummed into her breaking
heart

EXT FOREST — CALEDONIA - DAY

Tiring now the OFFICER tears and stumbles through the
drenching forest In his fist he still grips the Eagle of
the Ninth

Suddenly like ghosts emerging from the dark a great line of
CELTS appears through the trees brandishing spears

The OFFICER jerks to a halt and

LUTORIUS and the FORT SURGEON are standing over him He blinks
at them searching for his bearings

MARCUS lets out a sigh of relief He tries to move Pain
roars up from his leg

LUTORIUS
They came Their Commander’s in his

MARCUS blinks The first glimmer of the loss to come

The FORT SURGEON lifts a cup of bitter broth to his lips
MARCUS drinks The FORT SURGEON settles his head back

MARCUS
(starting to drift)
How did I get off the battlefield

LUTORIUS
Oh a lot of us had a hand in that sir

MARCUS
How are the men

LUTORIUS
The men are anxious to know how

MARCUS

Ive decided to give up chariots

He blacks out
CUT TO

INT UNCLE AQUILA’S VILLA - SOUTHERN ENGLAND - DAYS LATER
The sound of bird-song

MARCUS opens his eyes

Hes lying on a different bed in an unfamiliar room

For a second he assumes himself te be dead then slowly he
turns his head to look down at himself He lifts the sheet
The whole of his lower half is a mash of blood and bandage

Turning away he glances at the sun-drenched room Opposite
is an open door with a different pctted rose outside On the
walls are beautiful frescoes of fish An elderly servant
(STEPHANOS) lies asleep on a divan snoring softly

MARCUS tries to speak All that comes out is a croak The
sound wakes STEPHANOS with a jerk He takes one look at
MARCUS and promptly hurries out

MARCUS tries to call him back But even the slightest
movement brings a stab of searing pain He lies back

After a moment a huge man steps into the doorway and smiles
cispassionately

UNCLE AQUILA is in his mid-50s bald big boned - with limbs
that appear to have been loosely strung together from wet
leather When he speaks his manner is bluff and acerbic
with a certain self-conscious irony

UNCLE AQUILA
Morning

MARCUS peers - who is this man UNCLE AQUILA reads his look

UNCLE AQUILA (CONT’D)

Calleva-

UNCLE AQUILA

transferred You nearly died
(beat moving on)
Do you have any memory of the
journey here

A beat MARCUS shakes his head

UNCLE AQUILA (CONTD)
No Just as well Two hundred
leagues in a mule cart with an
injury like yoursnot my idea of
fun

(with a twinkle)

You dont happen to play draughts
do you

MARCUS
(taken aback)
Umsometimes

UNCLE AQUILA

Im addicted Most of the time my
only opponent’s old Stephanos I
rather suspect he’s humouring me I
look forward to a more willing
adversary

(beat)
He’s a fine nurse mind you Hasn’t
left your side all week

MARCUS
Ive been here a week

UNCLE AQUILA
Thereabouts Im afraid I lost count

STEPEANOS bustles back in carrying a jar of hot water

STEPHANCS
How is the patient

UNCLE AQUILA
Alive

STEPHANOSs face A look He begins mixing a sack of dried
herbs into some hot water

UNCLE AQUILA (CONT’D)
Well I hope that whatever he’s about
to give you does you good It smells
repellent

Smiling UNCLE AQUILA walks out STEPHANOS gently lifts
MARCUS’s head and brings a cup of bitter broth to his lips

STEPHANOS
Drink It was made up for you by
the Fort Surgecn

As MARCUS drinks their eyes meet

MARCUS
How long before I can go back

STEPHANOS blinks nervously

FLASHBACK TO

The Eagle of the Ninth is now gripped in a ringless HAND
Different but as yet unexplained The HAND lifts the great
bird skyward As the Eagle rises a roar like the sound of
baying wolves swells the sky

BACK TO

INT UNCLE AQUILA’S VILLA - MARCUS’S QUARTERS - DAY

MARCUS jerks awake As he comes-to the first wave of regret
washes over him He turns to face the wall

INT UNCLE AQUILA’S VILLA - MARCUS’S QUARTERS —- DAY

Some days later

MARCUS is now well enough to hobble about on two sticks With
painful slowness he makes his way towards the window UNCLE
AQUILA appears in the doorway

UNCLE AQUILA
You have a visitor

LUTORIUS steps into the room In honour of the occasion he
wears full armour Sunlight catches the metal making him
seem unreachably glorious

MARCUS adjusts his sticks humiliated to be seen like this
In his awkwardness he stiffens Formal

MARCUS
Lutorius

LUTORIUS
Sir
(beat)
The men have been asking after you

MARCUS
Thank them from me

LUTORIUS
I will sir

Silence LUTORIUS looks down at his old Commander He is
deeply shocked to see him so transformed UNCLE AQUILA can
see it in his face He comes to his rescue

UNCLE AQUILA
You had good news for my nephew
did you not

LUTORIUS
Yes - sorry — I received news
yesterday from headquarters For
holding the fort under extreme
duress the Cohort of the Fourth
Gaulish has been awarded the gilded
laurel From today their standard
will carry its first wreath

MARCUS smiles genuinely touched
MARCUS
Tell the men I could not be more
proud

LUTORIUS is delighted to catch a glimpse of the old MARCUS
He stumbles straight on

LUTORIUS
And that’s not all sir You
yourself have been awarded the
military signum for conspicuous
gallantry

LUTORIUS hands him the bracelet
LUTORIUS (CONT’D)
The citation reads “honour and
faithfulness”
MARCUS holds the heavy metal in the palm of his hand
MARCUS

(softly)
Honour and faithfulness

LUTORIUS

Its etched into the metal There
MARCUS

Yes I see it

A beat

LUTORIUS

May I be the first to offer my

congratulations

The effect of his own emotions - too personal now - makes
MARCUS unable to respond as before He can only nod eyes
fixed on the bracelet A pause

UNCLE AQUILA
I think perhaps my nephew is tired

LUTORIUS
Yes
(beat)
Sir
LUTORIUS salutes
MARCUS

(without looking up)
Thank you Lutorius

LUTORIUS hangs there a moment then he and UNCLE AQUILA walk
out MARCUS can hear them talking softly as the old man sees
the Centurion out The door shuts Lutorius is gone

MARCUS stares down at the bracelet in his hand

Slowly - carefully - he attempts to fix the bracelet around
his wrist But even this tiny feat is too painful

He’s reduced to picking it up in his teeth and trying to slip
it over his fingers The metal links keep skewing He tries
again A flinch of pain makes him gasp and the bracelet falis
to the floor

He stares down at it lying there at his feet Suddenly all
his pent-up pain and frustration explodes into his chest and
he lets out a roar

INT UNCLE AQUILA’S VILLA MASTER QUARTERS - DAY

Hearing him cry out UNCLE AQUILA looks up STEPHANOS hurries
past ready to rush to Marcus’s aide The old man holds him
back

UNCLE AQUILA
Leave him Stephanos Theres no
medicine for that

EXT UNCLE AQUILAS VILLA - GARDEN DAY
Some months later

Spring has come again and the garden is bursting with life
STEPHANOS potters about the garden tending to the plants
MARCUS limps out on his sticks and the old servant
immediately hurries over to help He carries over a cushioned
chair and eases MARCUS into it MARCUS sighs at being so
“mothered” his frustration beginning to surface

EXT UNCLE AQUILA’S VILLA - GARDEN - DAY

Later MARCUS is seated in the cushioned chair staring
vaguely at the neighbouring house and garden The sound of
barking He sees a flash of a white toga A beautiful young
girl (COTTIA) - about eleven or twelve —- races through the
garden chasing a dog Her innocence and freedom are in such
stark contrast to his own mood as to seem almost
otherworldly Someone calls for her

MOTHER OS
Cottia

COTTIA turns - catching a glimpse of MARCUS - then hurries
back inside

INT UNCLE AQUILA’S VILLA MASTER QUARTERS - EVENING

MARCUS is seated his leg heavily strapped He’s playing
draughts with UNCLE AQUILA In the background old STEPHANOS
sweeps the floor A pause

MARCUS
What was my father like

UNCLE AQUILA
Your father

MARCUS
I hardly knew him

UNCLE AQUILA pauses - taking this in - then resumes playing

UNCLE AQUILA
Your father was the perfect Roman
With all that’s good about that

MARCUS
Did you like him

UNCLE AQUILA

(smiling ruefully)
We were brothers We werent
brought up to “like” each other we
were brought up to compete In that
respect our dear mother was a true
Roman

(beat)
I’m not even sure I actually knew
him well enough to “like” him or
not Was I jealous of him Yes Did
I love him Yes

MARCUS
But when you were older - you were
both soldiers That’s something you
shared isn’t it

UNCLE AQUILA

A little

(beat)
When my Legion was stationed here I
fell in love with a local girl She
died not long after and1I simply
stayed Sometimes grief holds you in
one place forever

Cn that last line he looks directly at MARCUS For a moment
their eyes meet then MARCUS breaks it

UNCLE AQUILA (CONTD)
I saw very little of your father
after that My fault I should have
moved on I’m too old to change
now You howeveryou have your
whole life ahead of you

MARCUS
What life All I ever dreamed about
was being a soldier

UNCLE AQUILA
Youll get over it
(moving his piece)
When your mother died her - what was
it - her sister brought you up

MARCUS nods stiffly

UNCLE AQUILA (CONTD)
You could return to her I suppose

MARCUS
Id rather die than go back there

UNCLE AQUILA
So That’s settled then Your move

INT UNCLE AQUILA’S VILLA - MARCUSS QUARTERS —- NIGHT

Moonlight fills the sleeping quarters MARCUS lies facing
the wall unable to sleep

INT UNCLE AQUILAS VILLA MARCUSS QUARTERS - DAY

The next morning sunlight streams into the room MARCUS lies
awake on the bed still facing to the wall On the table
beside him a tray of untouched food

UNCLE AQUILA strolls in carrying the small carved wooden
bird

UNCLE AQUILA
This came for you from the fort It was
found in your quarters You recognize it

MARCUS nods He takes the small bird in his hand The weight
of it there in his palm A beat

UNCLE AQUILA (CONT’D)
Up you get We’re going to the games

MARCUS
Games

UNCLE AQUILA
Yes You know fun

XT CALLEVA COLISEUM — DAY

ti

A third world version of the big time A single street
leading to a small wooden coliseum Along the way the usual
STREET KIDS selling drinks sweets fried food and souvenirs
CROWDS OF LOCALS AND LEGIONARIES pour past in holiday mood

INT LITTER - DAY

A still bewildered MARCUS sits in a litter with UNCLE AQUILA
on his way to the games

UNCLE AQUILA
It’s not the Coliseum obviously but
they put on quite a good show A few
wild beasts a sham fight even a
couple of real ones if they can
afford it

MARCUS couldn’t care less

He stares out across the crowd He notices the beautiful
young girl COTTIA from the neighbouring house She’s
walking towards the coliseum with her GIRLFRIENDS laughing
and joking with the same easy freedom as before

INT CALLEVA COLISEUM - DAY

Ashamed of his invalidity MARCUS descends the stairs on the
arm of two SERVANTS UNCLE AQUILA walks ahead chatting to
acquaintances Ail the way to his seat LOCAL WORTHIES
MOTHERS and DAUGHTERS point and giggle - their first glimpse
of the handsome young Commander staying in their midst

Down in the arena GLADIATORS are sham-fighting Some of the
CROWD watch others talk amongst themselves catching up on
business

UNCLE AQUILA
(helping Marcus into his seat)
Here we are Ease him down Gently
Hes not a sack of rice

Seated MARCUS looks about The sudden magic of space and
light hits him between the eyes like a shot of adrenaline

In the arena twenty GLADIATORS are shaim-fighting Swordsmen
wrestlers axemen - all hand-to-hand The crowd roar on their
favourites and boo the losers

Finally an ASSISTANT blows a warning on his trumpet and the
GLADIATORS stop

ASSISTANT
(bigging it up)
And nowa fight to the death

The CROWD turn in their seats All talking stops

At a command from the CAPTAIN OF THE GLADIATORS all his men
retreat except for one He carries a three-pronged spear and
net Hes clearly a favourite with the crowd who call out
his nickname THE FISHER

Two ASSISTANTS drag a young Celt slave (ESCA) into the arena

Stripped to the waist ESCA bears the blue markings of the
northern tribes his long hair flung back grey-—blue eyes
staring straight ahead with a fierce pride One of the
ASSISTANTS hands him a sword and dagger

Something about him immediately captures MARCUS’s attention
In his look and demeanour he resembles the charioteer
Cradoc But it’s the look in the Celt’s eyes that really
holds him

UNCLE AQUILA
(mutters disparagingly)
A gladiator and a slave Never a
fair contest

At a sign from the CAPTAIN OF THE GLADIATORS ESCA and THE
FISHER step into the centre The CAPTAIN places them ten
paces apart then licks his finger checking for the
direction of the breeze He shifts each man very slightly
ensuring no advantage of wind or light Finally he retreats
to the barriers

For a split-second MARCUS notices the young girl COTTIA in
the stands opposite She stares intently at the two men in
the centre of the arena

Absolute silence MARCUS can hear his own breathing A sudden
cramp in his leg makes him wince but he keeps his eyes fixed
on the young Celt

For a long moment ESCA and THE FISHER are still Finally
ESCA starts circling his opponent THE FISHER stands poised
on the balls of his feet net and trident at the ready
Suddenly ESCA lunges The net flies out and lands harmlessly
behind him The FISHER darts aside just missing ESCA’s sword
thrust The crowd “oohs” appreciatively

Grabbing his net from the ground the FISHER sprints away
ESCA chases after him running low like a hunter The two men
tear around the perimeter making a half-circle of the arena
until they are back in front of the private boxes

Without warning the FISHER whirls about and flings the net
once more It whips out hitting ESCA full in the body
Caught off-guard he crashes headlong and rolls over and
over helplessly enmeshed in the netting

MARCUS wrenches forward breath caught in his throat The
young Celt is lying right below his seat He can hear him
panting see the sweat glisten on his upper-lLip

The FISHER strolls over The CROWD roar He raises his
trident for the death strike Glancing up he gives his fans
a little me-again smile waiting for their verdict

The CROWD hold out their thumbs A few turned up most down

For a moment ESCA appears to raise his arm from inside the
mesh of netting signalling an appeal for mercy - but he
lets it drop back Suddenly he is staring straight into
MARCUS’s eyes a look as direct and intimate as if they were
the only two people in the arena Thenstill looking at
MARCUS he twists his head and offers his neck for the kill

MARCUS spots COTTIA She’s standing as high as she can on her
seat both thumbs turned upward

Suddenly MARCUS is gripped by a mission to save this man’s
life He shoots out of his seat one hand on the barrier to
steady himself the other held high thumb upward

MARCUS
Come On

But the thumbs in the crowd are still majority-down

Clenching his whole body with the effort of will MARCUS
thrusts out his hand

MARCUS (CONT’D)
Thumbs up Thumbs up you fools

Finally a few spectators start turning their thumbs upwards
The FISHER glances round uncertain which way it’s going
MARCUS (CONTD)
(pressing forward)

Come on

More and more thumbs begin turning upward MARCUS glances
round determined angry

UNCLE AQUILA sits beside him slight smile thumb raised

Still its in the balance Finally with a little mocking
bow the FISHER raises his trident and steps back ATTENDANTS
rush forward and begin disentangling ESCA An ironic cheer
goes up from the FISHER’s fans

UNCLE AQUILA
(aside dryly)
You keep this up the Captain of
the Gladiators will have you on
commission
MARCUS’s leg is suddenly agony

MARCUS
I need to go

UNCLE AQUILA clicks his finger The two SERVANTS begin
helping MARCUS out As he stumbles up the steps he throws
one last look back over his shoulder

ESCA lies where he fell staring straight at MARCUS A moment
of the purest shame

His finger traces over the wings the nooks where his father

carved the feather-curves

YOUNG MARCUS wanders through the moonlit courtyard gripping
the little wooden bird He’s drawn forward by the sound of
weeping As he nears his parents rooms he sees his MOTHER

She’s tearing at her hair overwhelmed with emotion

YOUNG MARCUS stares helpless at her agony

The sound of feet on stone then UNCLE AQUILA appears

UNCLE AQUILA
Ive bought you a slave

MARCUS
I don’t need a slave

UNCLE AQUILA
Im not sure poor old Stephanos is
up to serving two masters I
thought a body slave would
complement the household

MARCUS
I should have been consulted

Boy

ESCA walks in MARCUS stiffens in shock ESCA stares straight
ahead avoiding his eye

UNCLE AQUILA (CONTD)
His name’s Esca

UNCLE AQUILA walks out

ESCA doesn’t move MARCUS sits stiffly on the bed A long
sullen silence neither young man giving an inch Finally

MARCUS
I’ve no use for you

ESCA
T had no wish to be bought

Angrily MARCUS picks up his sticks and hobbles to the window

MARCUS
You could have run My uncle would
never have been able to stop you

ESCA
T have a debt of honour to you now
There’s no choice in that

MARCUS
You don’t sound very pleased
ESCA
No man should have to beg for his
life
MARCUS

You didn’t I did And I meant
nothing by it

Another sullen pause Finally ESCA pulls out a dagger from
inside his tunic and throws it at MARCUS’s feet MARCUS stares
down at the exquisitely decorated hilt the deadly metal

MARCUS (CONT’D)
Whats that

ESCA
It came from my father He who owns
it owns me

The knife is yours

MARCUS is held by that glittering knife - the most aggressive
act of submission it’s possible to imagine

ESCA stands in the shadows barely part of the scene A
fringe-figure outside the circle of light

2 MARCUS hobbles back to his quarters on his sticks Behind
him walks ESCA ESCA hangs back in the doorway but MARCUS
ignores him completely

3 Night MARCUS tosses and turns in his sleep Barely
visible in the doorway stands ESCA He stares down at the
sleeping figure with hooded eyes dangerous unreadable

4 MARCUS hobbles across the garden towards his favorite spot
on the cushioned chair ESCA walks a pace behind As usual
he is ignored by his new master Losing his footing MARCUS
stumbles ESCA whips down his spear in a single movement
catching MARCUS under the arm stopping him from falling And
yet the latent violence is unmistakable Unnerved and angry
MARCUS shrugs off the spear and hobbles on

MARCUS
Leave me alone

Ignored by the other servant ESCA crouches by the door He
now seems barely part of the household at all

in front of him examining his leg ESCA stands nearby

Who searched this wound

The surgeon at the fort

FIELD SURGEON
Was he drunk I’ve never seen such
a mess

MARCUS

We were under attack He did the
best he could

there You’1l never heal properly

A startlingly different winter landscape

Shooting through the trees the camera dips and lifts with
the rise and fall of two riders at full gallop

MARCUS and ESCA are out hunting their horses charging
through frosted woodland Hidden in the undergrowth a wild
boar scatters ahead of them turning this way and that

ESCA is a superb rider He closes in on the boar matching
it swerve for swerve Finally stooping low in the saddle
eyes ablaze with warrior-instinct he raises his spear and
huris

Some in my tribe boasted that they
saw a great army of Romans march
north fifteen years ago They say
that the soldiers liked the weather
so much they stayed and married

MARCUS
What else do they say

ESCA
That their Eagle is a god and he
haunts the mists still

MARCUS
Your tribe believes that

hill staring out over a vast tract of frosted land It rolls
away into infinity hauntingly beautiful Finally out of the
silence

War Shield of the Brigantes Lord
of five hundred spears I was his
armour-bearer until I became a

MARCUS stiffens defensively still grimy from the hunt

UNCLE AQUILA
Claudius may I present my nephew
Marcus Claudius is an old friend

boasting about you

Tell me Placidus How do you find
working for a Legate no less

CLAUDIUS
Placidus is far too well-connected to
be impressed by a few oak-leaves
Soon as he’s completed his year in
the military he’s off to the Senate
PLACIDUS
If it was my choice I’d be a soldier
all my life Howevermy father will
insist I go into politics

Have we met before Your name sounds

familiar
MARCUS
I doubt it
PLACIDUS
The Tribunes club in Rome
MARCUS
No I was only a ranker Centurion
PLACIDUS
Ah Right
CLAUDIUS

(gently reprimanding)
I told you This is Marcus Aquila The
officer who saved the fort at Isca

He lifts MARCUSs sleeve to reveal the iron bracelet

CLAUDIUS (CONTD)
He carries the Signum for outstanding
bravery ‘
(beat)
Not something Rome hands out every day

PLACIDUS gives the bracelet a cursory glance

PLACIDUS
Forgive me I should have
remembered Aquila Your father
marched with the Eagles too did
he not

MARCUS
First Cohort of the Ninth Hispanic

PLACIDUS
of course The Ninth Every Roman
remembers the Ninth

An awkward pause

CLAUDIUS
Talking of the Ninth theres been
a rumour recently along the Wall
which if it’s true would suggest
the Hispana did indeed go down
fighting

UNCLE AQUILA
Ooh

CLAUDIUS
The story goes that the Eagle’s been
receiving divine honours in some
tribal temple in the far north

PLACIDUS
An Eagle in the hands of the
Painted People Thats a potent
weapon One has to wonder how any
Roman could let it go

MARCUS tenses UNCLE AQUILA gives him a look - stay calm

CLAUDIUS
What can I do We’ve only three
Legions in Britain I can hardly send
an expeditionary force into the
unknown based on a rumour

UNCLE AQUILA
What does Rome say

CLAUDIUS

Eagle lost honour lost Honour lost
all lost

(beat)
Rome would love to get the Eagle back
They’d pay handsomely for it too
butpolitics being politics no
Senator’s going to risk scores of
lives for a tainted Legion My hands
are tied

MARCUS
What if one man were to go on his own

The others all stare at him For a long moment no-one speaks

UNCLE AQUILA
North of the wall No Roman could
survive there alone

MARCUS
But if he did it for Rome aren’t
the risks worth it

UNCLE AQUILA

What’s past is past Don’t waste
your life chasing ghosts

PLACIDUS
Quite right

another pointless death

IT will not sit in some villa for the rest
of my days rotting and remembering

A beat

UNCLE AQUILA
Then what would you do

MARCUS stares Both of them eye to eye

MARCUS
Look for the Eagle Where a Legion
could not get through one man
might If I can serve Rome and my
father at the same time-

UNCLE AQUILA
Getting yourself killed wont
redeem the family’s honour

MARCUS
My father would be proud of me

Silence MARCUS stares stubbornly at his uncle Finally
seeing the truth UNCLE AQUILA sighs

UNCLE AQUILA
You may as well tell me your plan
since it’s clear you already have one

MARCUS’s shoulders drop Instantly anger gives way to a
surge of excitement A short pause and then he’s away

MARCUS
Esca is the son of a Clan
Chieftain It’s not unknown for the
Brigantes to take slaves of their
own Well buy a pair of retired
cavalry horses and make our way
towards the wall

MIX TO

EXT THE ROMAN FRONTIER - HADRIAN’S WALL - DAY

High and wide over the northern borders Cutting across the
rolling landscape awesome in its scale and grandeur runs
the great gash of Hadrians Wall Eighty miles of stonework
cresting hills weaving with the land a bastion of Empire

MARCUS (VO)
While were on the this side we
remain a Roman and his slave
travelling for trade

EXT HADRIAN’S WALL - MILE ENCAMPMENT - DAY

SCA and MARCUS ride slowly towards one of the encampments
along the wall

Drawing nearer we become aware of the sharp contrast between
the hubbub of activity on the Roman side and the silent
wilderness beyond

MARCUS (VO)
Once we clear the frontier we
become a Celt warrior and his Roman
slave

EXT HADRIANS WALL GATE - DAY

MARCUS and ESCA ride up to the heavily manned gate Around
them MERCHANTS TRADERS and MILITARY PERSONNEL come and go
in what amounts to a satellite village attached to the Roman
side of the wall

Bs the gates open a few SOLDIERS turn to watch the still-
unusual sight of two traders erossing into the unknown

MARCUS (VO0)

Esca knows the southern uplands and
speaks the language He can guide
us through Once we make the high
hills well stay in the forests
Should anyone question us they’L
discover a young Clan Chief heading
north to pay his respects to the
hidden Eagle

As ESCA and MARCUS pass under the gate the camera lifts up
and over the wall revealing the great sweep of land beyond
the frontier On and on it runs forest upon forest mountain
upon mountain dark and forbidding

EXT LOWLANDS - BEYOND THE FRONTIER - DAY

Drifting slowly down the camera finds MARCUS and ESCA alone
on the far side of the frontier Evening light plays on the
distant wall now only a thin line in the distance

They are riding along a track fringing impenetrable forest

Already the sense of isolation is palpable MARCUS glances
round then pulls up

MARCUS
Well stop here Ready

They dismount and swap glothes each man becoming the other
A beat MARCUS studies ESCA with a grin

MARCUS (CONT’D)
very smart How do I look

ESCA
Your hands are too Roman

MARCUS rubs in some earth and “shows” ESCA smiles nods

ESCA (CONTD)
I cant be a Clan Chief without a
weapon

MARCUS’S FACE In all his planning he hadnt thought of
that He walks over to his horse and pulls out the short
sword and the intricately decorated dagger Esca gave him
when submitting himself

MARCUS hesitates Should he give him back the dagger
ESCA watches him
Finally - without quite realizing the significance of this
hesitation - MARCUS sheathes the dagger back in the saddle
bag and hands over his short sword
ESCA says nothing
MARCUS
This was mine If anyone asks you

say it’s a war trophy

ESCA
Tll tell them we fought and I won

Deadpan MARCUS lunges with the dagger catching ESCA off-
guard ESCA falls onto his backside both laughing

INT FOREST - DAY

A few hours later ESCA and MARCUS ride down the slope of a
thickly wooded vale ESCA raises his hand They stop

ESCA
Listen

MARCUS
What

MARCUS strains to hear Faintly he catches the sound of
humming ESCA kicks on his whole body alert to the slightest
motion of the air

As they near the bottom of the vale the sound of humming
mutates into the buzzing of flies Suddenly ESCA freazes
MARCUS rides up and stops dead

The stench is almost unbearable

Twenty yards away almost obliterated by the frenzy of
insects hang the rotting headless corpses of three young
Celts Blue body markings are still visible on their putrid
flesh They have been strung by their legs from long ropes
slung over branches

MARCUS (CONTD)
Who did this

ESCA
Rogue warriors None from my tribe
would do such a thing
(quiet)
This is a bad place to be

MARCUS looks across ESCA’S still face is unreadable He
turns his horse and rides on MARCUS glances back one last

time - the image of those gently swaying podies imprinting
themselves cn his mind

EXT LOWLANDS - HIGH GROUND - EVENING

ESCA and MARCUS have made camp on a high dale In front of
them deepening into gloom the great hills of the northern
territories stretch away and beyond

FSCA kneels over 4 small fire cooking a ration of cured
meat With a heightened sense of danger he completes 4 bow
pulling the string across the arc At his feet lie a pile of
completed arrows

A wolf howls in the distance ESCA Lifts his head scanning
the horizon

Satisfied that they’re alone he picks up the meat and
carries it to where MARCUS is kneeling on the ground digging
at the earth with Esca’s dagger

ESCA
Whats that

MARCUS
An altar

MARCUS carries on digging ESCA crouches nearby and watches
MARCUS digs the last of a series of small square turfs from

the grass With these he constructs the altar Onto the top
he adds bark sticks and sprigs of heather

He hollows them into the shape of a nest then sprinkles
flower petals over the top He brings out the wooden bird and
lays it carefully in the middle of the nest

ESCA hands him the flint and steel

Close-up on MARCUS as he kneels forward sending out the
first golden sparks

FLASHBACK TO

EXT ROMAN VILLA - DAY

Blinded by sunlight YOUNG MARCUS stands beside his MOTHER
ve-living that moment when the silhouette of his FATHER rides
away for the last time

BACK TO

EXT LOWLANDS - HIGH GROUND - EVENING

Extreme close-up on the yellow flames licking around the
small bird Gradually the sculpted wood catches fire and the
tiny animal is enveloped

MARCUS completes a murmured prayer then sits back eyes fixed
on the burning sacrifice A pause The two of them staring
into the flames

ESCA
Who do you pray to

MARCUS
Mithras light of the Sun

ESCA
Hes your protector

MARCUS nods

ESCA (CONT’D)
Whats the bird You always carry it

MARCUS
My father gave it to me

ESCA
You must love your god very much to
give him such a sacrifice
MARCUS doesnt answer ESCA stares at the fire A beat

ESCA (CONTD)
I cannot love what I do not know

MARCUS
You have no geds

ESCA
We have many gods for many things
But they did not protect my family
when we needed them

MARCUS
Then what guides you

ESCA
My eyes My heart

MARCUS
Nothing else

ESCA is still After a moment’s doubt he shakes his head A
pause MARCUS gazes at the horizon

MARCUS (CONTD)
Sometimes I think I‘ll still find
my father alive Do you believe
that’s possible - that he could
have survived in some hidden place

ESCA
I have seen my father kill my mother
for love
(beat)
I know there is no impossibility
the world cannot contain

EXT HILLS - LOWLANDS - DAY

The next day From high and wide we look down on MARCUS and
ESCA riding slowly across the side of a hill dwarfed by the
huge landscape

EXT FOREST - LOWLANDS - DAY

ESCA and MARCUS ride through dense forest

EXT RIVER - LOWLANDS - DAY

Stripped to the waist ESCA stands dead-still in the middle
of a river Very gently he dips his hand into the water and
under the belly of a trout Tickling the underside of its
skin he soothes it to stillness then plop - he lifts it
out

EXT RIVERBANK - LOWLANDS — DAY

ESCA and MARCUS eat the cooked fish while their horses graze
Slowly ESCA goes still He stares over MARCUS’s head

ESCA
(softly)
Don‘t move

MARCUS freezes Carefully ESCA reaches out a hand and pulls
his spear and short sword close He pushes the sword towards
MARCUS

ESCA (CONTD)
Behind you across the riverbank
Six warriors

Keeping the same stillness ESCA gathers his bow and arrows

ESCA (CONTD)
When I say ‘now’ make for the tree
to your left

MARCUS pulls out his dagger balancing sword and knife in
either hand

ESCA pretends to eat eyes fixed on the trees across the
bank The YOUNG WARRIORS are clearly visible now darting
between the trees forming a semi-circle around their prey
Twenty yards away the LEADING WARRIOR raises his hand They
freeze Slowly he raises his spear and

ESCA (CONTD)
Now

ESCA and MARCUS burst left and right In the same split-
second a spear smashes into the turf exactly where Marcus
gat A roar goes up and the SIX WARRIORS charge

ESCA hits one with his first arrow

Hidden in the undergrowth MARCUS can hear them coming He
crouches low testing his leg At the last second he bursts
straight into the path of a YOUNG WARRIOR One stab and the
YOUNG WARRIOR collapses

The next two are suddenly above him Only an arrow from
ESCA’s bow saves him from an axe blow A third WARRIOR
collapses

MARCUS spins to face his other attacker As he does so he’s
hit with a glancing spear-blow The short sword spins out of
his hand Blood burns from a cut in his arm He thrusts
himself head first into his attacker Both of them fall to
the ground As they tumble down the bank MARCUS manages to
knock the Celt’s spear away They bang up against a tree

Slamming down his hands MARCUE pins the other man to the

ground

He finds himself staring into the eyes of a terrified YOUNG
WARRIOR The boy’s eyes are drug-glazed but stiil child-like
in their fear The YOUNG WARRIOR struggles a moment then his
body goes limp and he twists his neck offering himself for
the death blow

MARCUS falters Nothing happens He pulls back The YOUNG
WARRIOR scrambles to his feet and begins sprinting away

He reaches the riverbank when an arrow slams into his back
killing him instantly

MARCUS spins round to find ESCA bow poised from the strike

MARCUS
What are you doing

ESCA
Hed have been back with twenty
others and wed be dead Next time
don’t hesitate

ESCA begins gathering up his weapons

On MARCUS taking this in

EXT RIVERBANK - LOWLANDS — DAY

ESCA’s found the warriors’ horses tethered to a tree On each
saddle hang the skulls of their victims MARCUS walks up
still shaken

ESCA
Well take their best two horses
the rest we’ll turn out Their
animals will be more used to this
terrain

EXT FOREST LOWLANDS - DAY
MARCUS and ESCA ride two warrior-horses out of the forest The

animals are magnificent with beautiful Celtish markings
burned into their rumps

EXT HILLTOP - LOWLANDS — DAY

Rising to the top of a hill ESCA and MARCUS take in the
endless wilderness all around

ESCA
(pointing)
Over those hills is as far as I’ve
ever been

MARCUS stares into the distance

MARCUS
The Legion would have had to pass
through here After that were
guessing

ESCA
Theres a village to the west of
that range We could ask there
Maybe someone remembers

EXT LOWLANDS - VILLAGE - DAY

MARCUS and ESCA ride up to a small hamlet of huts The moment
theyre sighted the WOMEN bundle their CHILDREN out of sight
The only man appears to be a lone VILLAGE ELDER who stands his
ground spear in hand MARCUS holds back as ESCA rides on

EXT LOWLANDS - VILLAGE - DAY

From the shadows MARCUS watches ESCA talking to the VILLAGE
ELDER After a while ESCA turns and rides back

ESCA
(shaking his head)
Nothing

A beat MARCUS takes in the WOMEN peering from hut doorways

MARCUS
Where are all the men

ESCA
(shrugs uneasy)
I don’t know Hunting maybe

A beat

MARCUS
What now

ESCA
You have to choose
(beat)
Left to the Western Isles right
to the Northern Highlands

MARCUS
Well go right But not direct We
cast across and back on ourselves
That way if there’s a trail we
dont miss it

EXT LOCH LOMOND - DAY

Winter is closing in as MARCUS and ESCA reach Loch Lomond Is
the distance the first highland peaks

EXT CENTRAL HIGHLANDS - MOUNTAINS DAY

Battling through heavy snow MARCUS and ESCA ride across the
highlands The ground is so icy they’re forced to dismount
and walk beside their horses

EXT CENTRAL HIGHLANDS - MOUNTAINS - NIGHT

Cloaked against the wind MARCUS crouches beside the dying
embers of a fire Curled up beside him ESCA sleeps

A wolf howls in the dark MARCUS glances up suddenly alert
He reaches for his short-sword rests it over his knees and
tucks the cloak tighter around him

EXT CENTRAL HIGHLANDS - NORTH EAST - DAY

ESCA and MARCUS ride through the far north eastern highiands

EXT CENTRAL HIGHLANDS - NORTH EAST DAY

From a distant hill-top we watch MARCUS and ESCA trudging on
and CLOARED HUNTER drifts into frame close-up

Someone is watching them

EXT CENTRAL HIGHLANDS - COASTAL CLIFFS — DAY
A glorious spring day high skies blurred with cloud

MARCUS and ESCA ride to the top of a peak and halt Below
them as far as the eye can see is ocean

A long silence

MARCUS
Three months and weve found
nothing

ESCA

Weve covered only the smallest
part of the north They could have
gone west Or we could have missed
the trail

MARCUS
What do we do now

ESCA
This is not the farthest north If
we were to follow the coast wed
continue on through Caledonia We
could do that or we could double-
back and hope we missed something

MARCUS is silent Finally he digs in his pocket and brings
out a coin

MARCUS
When theres nothing to guide a
man’s choice then it’s time to lay
the choice on the gods
(beat)
Heads we push on ships we cast back

MARCUS balances the disc of silver between thumb and
forefinger ready to spin ESCA leans forward drawn to the
moment MARCUS grins

MARCUS (CONTD)
T thought you didn’t believe

Caught in the act ESCA sits back in his saddle MARCUS
flicks the coin to reveal

MARCUS (CONTD)

In an exact mirror of the earlier shot ESCA and MARCUS ride
back through the far north eastern highlands

EXT CENTRAL HIGHLANDS - EDGE OF FOREST - DAY

MARCUS vides behind ESCA as they enter another forest MARCUS
tenses in the saddle A flicker of movement on the edge of
his vision has alerted him He scans the forest No sign of
life He rides on

EXT CENTRAL HIGHLANDS - DEEP FOREST - DAY

MARCUS and ESCA are deep in the forest when MARCUS sees it
again - a flicker of movement on the high ground above them
Riding up to ESCA he points in the direction of the movement

MARCUS
I saw somethingon the ridge

ESCA stares Silence Only the wind in the trees He shakes
his head They ride on

MARCUS hangs back hoping to catch another glimpse of the
mysterious shadow But the forest is still

EXT CENTRAL HIGHLANDS -— DEEP FOREST — DAY

We are close on MARCUS now The path ahead is steep and
stony His horse shifts uneasily beneath him Loosening the
reins he sits back in the saddle and

BR WARRIOR flies through the air hitting him chesthigh
MARCUS and the WARRIOR soar through the air

ESCA turns in his saddle grabbing for his bow and arrow
ALL of this in the space of a single war-cry

smack MARCUS and the WARRIOR hit the ground scrabbling for
control This man is much older and stronger than the boy
warrior He spits snatches claws - anything to gain the
upper hand Eventually MARCUS’s youth proves too much for
him MARCUS pins him to the ground one hand thrust against

the underside of his chin

This time MARCUS has no doubt Pulling out his dagger he
prepares to slit his throat when

MARCUS
Wait

ESCA
Do it
(beat screaming it at him)
DO IT
MARCUS

Hes a Legionary

MARCUS has stopped mid-strike The warrior (GUERN) stares
back eyes fixed

ESCA shakes his head in disgust

ESCA
Your wound has made you soft
(dismounting)
Ill do it

MARCUS
(rounding on him)
STAY WHERE YOU ARE
(back to Guern)
YOUR NAME

GUERN
(celtic shouting at Esca)
WHAT DOES HE WANT FROM ME

MARCUS
WHAT’S YOUR NAME

ESCA
HE DOESNT UNDERSTAND YOU

viciously MARCUS grabs GUERN’s hair and yanks back his head
showing the thickened scar on the underside of his chin

MARCUS
Chin-strap scar Only a Roman helmet
does that
(beat)
Your name Roman

GUERN stares back refusing to budge MARCUS gives his hair
another vicious tug face close right into him

MARCUS (CONTD)

A long pause Finally guttural low

GUERN
My name is Guern
(beat)
Formerly sixth Centurion Senior
Cohort of the Ninth Legion

A long silence MARCUS studies him GUERN grows uneasy

GUERN (CONTD)
Are you here to take me back

MARCUS shakes his head GUERN stares still unsure
GUERN (CONTD)
Im not afraid I know what happens to
deserters
MARCUS
Im not here to take you back
(beat)
Tell me what happened to the Nanth
No answer MARCUS looks him in the eye

MARCUS (CONT’D)

GUERN goes very still He stares coolly at MARCUS

GUERN
Tt should have known it

Silence MARCUS leans forward

MARCUS
What happened

FLASHBACK TO

the Eagle from a falling LEGIONARY

BACK TO

EXT DEEP FOREST - DAY
As memory roars back GUERN shakes his head
GUERN
I can’t speak of it

MARCUS
Tell me

GUERN
I ran before the end

MARCUS
You were attacked

GUERN stares at the ground in stubborn silence Finally

GUERN
I cant tell you but Ill show
you

MARCUS looks at him Their eyes meet

EXT NORTH EAST HIGHLANDS - RIDGEWAY - DAY

MARCUS and ESCA ride behind GUERN They are travelling along
a high ridge surrounded on all sides by highland peaks A
dead deer is strapped over the back of GUERN’s horse

ESCA moves up to MARCUS’s side voice low

ESCA
I don’t trust him He’s a deserter

MARCUS
What are you afraid of

ESCA
He ran away from your father when
he needed him most If it comes
down to it he’li slit your throat
rather than risk being tried for
desertion

MARCUS
He knows Im not here for that

ESCA
Why would he risk it

MARCUS Looks at him

MARCUS
You have no faith in anything do you

Angrily he kicks on his horse He comes alongside GUERN
leaving ESCA behind A pause

MARCUS (CONTD)
Why did you attack us

GUERN
I thought you were rogue warriors
Your horses had the markings-

MARCUS
We stole them They attacked us too

GUERN
You should be careful who you steal
from A man doesn’t wait for such
people to find his family

MARCUS
Where is your family

Not in Rome

EXT HIGHLANDS - HIGH HILL - EVENING

Evening sunlight cuts across a high hill GUERN crouches over
a fire cooking fresh meat

EXT HIGHLANDS - HIGH HILi - EVENING
MARCUS prays by a nearby stream whispering softly

MARCUS
Mithras god of light hear my prayer and
let my father live

Cpening his hands he sends water rushing back into the
stream A shower of droplets catch the light each one a
perfect miniature of the sun

In the distance GUERN watches this ritual His face betrays
the echo of old memories uneasy in his eyes

EXT HIGHLANDS - HIGH HILL — EVENING
GUERN MARCUS and ESCA eat round the fire MARCUS looks up

MARCUS
How could an entire Roman legion
just disappear

GUERN stares at the fire for a long moment This is hard for
him to talk about but he’s ready now

GUERN
The truth is the Ninth was doomed
long before it marched out to meet
the northern tribes Rome had been
in occupation here over sixty
years Count it Sixty years
(MORE)

GUERN (CONTD)

A Legionary could live and die in
that time and his only memory would
be the weather the blackmarkets
and endless bloody raids If wed
been satisfied with what we had
maybe wed have survived But oh
no Rome’s never satisfied Rome
wants more territory More wars
more conquests And who has to make
it happen Who has to slog into the
unknown in the name of Empire The
bloody footsoldiers

My first tour of duty was against
the Iceni Now that was a war We
had instructions to kill anything
that moved

smile the way our Legates talked
about “civilizing the savages”

EXT HIGHLANDS - EVENING

MARCUS ESCA and GUERN enter a huge forest As the trees
swallow them up they disappear from view

sudden they appear out of the
mist

MARCUS ESCA and GUERN ride through thick forest They’re
nearing the killing fields now Dotted between the trees are
hundreds of poles Rammed on the top of each is a skull The
death crop

GUERN (V0)
You could hear them picking men
off at the back one by one That
went on for a week We lost
hundreds of men When we sent out
sorties they never came back The
weather was starting to kill us
too The further north we marched
the worse it got By the end of the
second week we’d abandoned most of
eur equipment Shields swords and
spears were all we had with us
Once wed given up sending out
sorties they picked us off with
arrows

MARCUS ESCA and GUERN ride through the last of the trees
until they reach a circular glen of open ground surrounded
by forest

Flat limestone rocks like altars protrude from the turf On
top of the rocks lie the remains of Roman armour bits of
bone everything still laid out where the bodies were
sacrificed Around the altars covering every inch of ground
are half-rotten sandals Hundreds and hundreds of sandals

GUERN (V0)
Finally we gave up looking for
open ground We just turned and
faced them For four days and
nights we held off their attacks

FLASHBACK TO

Close-up on THE EAGLE OF THE NINTH held shoulder high in a
soldier’s fist It hangs there a dull glint of metal wings
surrounded by a blur of ARMS LEGS SWORDS and FACES
everything a rain-grey mass of slugged-out exhausted war

MARCUS ESCA and GUERN stop-dead on the rim of the killing
fields The three of them stare at the frozen devastation

GUERN (V0)
On the fifth night the men
mutinied Your father tried to stop
them but by that time all pride
had gone We were no longer Roman
We were hardly even human

GUERN stares

GUERN (CONTD)
(quiet)
That’s it No further

MARCUS dismounts transfixed

MARCUS
Why are there sandals everywhere

GUERN
Their joke They pulled them off
the dead bodies and threw them at
us So our souls could march to
hell

MARCUS
The rocks

GUERN
Altars for our officers We could
hear them being sacrificed

n He moves slowly amid the sandals

MARCUS
And my father

GUERN
After the mutiny your father
planned to break out to the west of
the glen with the remaining men
That’s when I ran

MARCUS
How many were left

GUERN
About a hundred

MARCUS
The enemy

GUERN
Many thousands

MARCUS takes this in He stares off in the direction Guern
has pointed Finally he steps towards the imagined point in
the trees where his father ran

FLASHBACK TO

Another angle on the same flashback of MARCUS’S FATHER and
five LEGIONARIES sprinting for their lives

Clenched in his emerald-ringed fist MARCUS’S FATHER grips
the Eagle of the Ninth This time because of the new angle
we see that there is real fear in his eyes

BACK TO

EXT THE KILLING FIELD - DAY

MARCUS turns sharply away He stares back at GUERN and ESCA
still waiting on the far side of the glen

MARCUS
What happened to the Eagle

GUERN
They say a tribe in the far north
have it The Seal People They’re a
strange violent race I don’t
recommend you go there

MARCUS
And if I do

SGUERN

(beat a look)
North west of here a week’s ride

You wont be alone Many men are on
the move now all heading that way
Why I don’t know But something
strange is happening

Thank you

I wish youd never come Youve
made me re-live my shame

MARCUS
I don’t judge you Ive never been
hunted

GUERN
Pray you never are

thispride shame or bothbut he does

All of us

He turns his horse and rides away

march north west Back across the mountains the glens and
the lochs

EXT WESTERN HIGHLANDS - EVENING

MARCUS and ESCA ride across a vast landscape of rolling
heathland within sight of the coast MARCUS stares at the
endless road to be travelled - still on edge

MARCUS
You always knew we should have
ridden west didn’t you

ESCA doesn’t answer

MARCUS (CONTD)
If you knew why didn’t you say

ESCA
I didn’t know

MARCUS
I don’t believe you

ESCA
I didnt know

MARCUS
(pointing at the land ahead)
Look at that Hundreds of miles of
wilderness and we havent even begun
I’ve wasted a whole summer and winter
wandering the north east and you
never once opened your mouth

ESCA refuses to be drawn MARCUS stares furiously at him
convinced of his own argument

MARCUS (CONT’D)
You knew

ESCA
I didn’t know

MARCUS

Youre lying

(beat)
What I saw in that forest is beyond
imagining Fifteen years ago - when
that happened - you were here Your
tribe was here And youre telling me
that the greatest victory in the
history of your people was unknown to
you

ESCA
“My people”

MARCUS
Don’t pretend to me

ESCA stares stubbornly ahead Finally

MARCUS (CONT’D)
Damn you Esca You will speak

Finally ESCA snaps turning on him with cold eyes

ESCA
Youre angry because youre afraid
youll find out your father was not
the hero you wish him to be You
say you love him yet you never
knew him All you have is what you
believe

He almost spits out the last word He turns his horse and
rides on MARCUS canters after him incandescent with rage

MARCUS
COME BACK HERE ESCA

They’re riding side by side now yelling at each other

YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE BOY
THINK YOU CAN GO ON ALONE

I SAVED YOUR MISERABLE LIFE

YOUD BE DEAD IN A DITCH WITHOUT ME

MARCUS leaps off his horse and crashes into ESCA pulling him
off his horse They thump to the ground rolling down the
hill fighting like dogs As they hit the bottom they smack
to a halt and

Staring down at them are FIFTEEN SEAL PEOPLE on horseback
Utter silence
ESCA and MARCUS freeze

The SEAL PEOPLE are unlike anyone we’ve seen up until now
Darker skinned heavily decorated with dark facial markings
seal skin coats and long feathered spears On the back of
some horses hang dead deer and boar

Their leader is a handsome young SEAL PRINCE marked out by
the twisted gold torque around his neck He stares at MARCUS
with fixed curiosity Despite his stillness - or because of
it - he is truly frightening

ESCA suddenly turns on MARCUS smacking him across the face
MARCUS crashes to the ground

ESCA (CONT’D)
Never speak to your Master like
that again

Stunned MARCUS stares up at him but ESCA refuses to engage

The SEAL PRINCE watches expressionless ESCA steps away from
MARCUS putting distance between them

Note whenever Celtic is spoken this is indicated in
italics and translated on screen in English subtitles

What do you do here

ESCA
(celtic)
I heard that the Hagle god is
calling people north Ive come to
pay my respects

The SEAL PRINCE stares at him in silence Finally maintaining
the same dangerous reserve he nods towards MARCUS

SEAL PRINCE
(celtic)
Who is he that you talk to in the
Roman tongue

ESCA
(celtic)
My slave

The SEAL PRINCE’s lips curl into a faint smile He kicks his
horse forward Coming right up to MARCUS he rides around
him staring all the time

MARCUS keeps his eyes on the ground

Bringing up his feathered spear the SEAL PRINCE points it at
MARCUS MARCUS holds himself steady

Using the spear like an extension of his arm the SEAL PRINCE
begins an examination of MARCUS He investigates his hair
his clothing and his face Finally placing the tip of the
spear on the underside of MARCUS’s chin he pushes it upward
forcing his head back His neck is now bared revealing the
thin chin-strap scar

The SEAL PRINCE gives a little grunt of delight Keeping his
spear on MARCUS’s neck he turns to the others

SEAL PRINCE
(celtic)
Its true Their god marks them all
with the same scar

He turns to ESCA

SEAL PRINCE (CONTD)
(celtic)
Ive heard of German tribes with Roman
Slaves but never here Is he good

ESCA
(celtic)
He works hard but he has a tongue
on him

The SEAL PRINCE grunts in amusement With his spear still
resting under MARCUS’s chin he casually observes

SEAL PRINCE
(celtic)
You were seen before by one of our
tribe After the last winter In the
East

ESCA
(celtic careful)
Yes

SEAL PRINCE
(celtic
Why do you travel so much if you have
nothing to trade

ESCA hesitates a fraction

ESCA
(celtic)
We seek the Eagle

SEAL PRINCE
(celtic)
You do not trade

ESCA
(celtic)
No

SEAL PRINCE
(celtic)
Then how did you learn to speak
their tongue

ESCA stalls MARCUS watches him tensing without knowing why

ESCA
(celtic)
My tribe was wiped out by their
Legions I was captured and sold as
a Slave After three summers I
escaped

SEAL PRINCE
(celtic)
How did you come by him

ESCA
(celtic)
A raiding party The rest of his troop
were killed I spared his life

Silence

The SEAL PRINCE stares at MARCUS still considering his
response

SEAL PRINCE
(celtic)
My father would like to see such a
Slave You will be my guest Our
village is five days march to the
west among the Loch of Many Islets

ESCA
(celtic)
The Eagle-

SEAL PRINCE
(cutting in celtic)
We do not speak of Holy Things

A beat Finally the SEAL PRINCE lowers his spear from under
MARCUS’s chin He turns to ESCA grinning boyishly

SEAL PRINCE (CONT’D)
(celtic)

You must teach your slave not to talk

to you as he does We will help you
Before ESCA can reply the SEAL PRINCE snaps his fingers and
one of his WARRIORS begins tying MARCUS’s hands to the end of
a long rope
MARCUS can feel panic rising He has absolutely no idea
what’s going to happen next He turns to ESCA whispering
frantically

MARCUS
What are they doing Esca

Avoiding his eye ESCA turns away

Suddenly the SEAL PRINCE yanks the rope and MARCUS smacks to
the ground A giggle of childish laughter from the other
WARRIORS

CUT TO

EXT WESTERN HIGHLANDS - DAY
High and wide over the Western Highlands

Diminutive against the vast landscape the horsemen of the
SEAL PEOPLE lead ESCA along the trail

Stumbling behind one end of the rope tied to ESCA’s horse
the other to his wrists comes MARCUS

EXT WESTERN HIGHLANDS - DAY

The WARRIORS reach a high-peak overlooking the sea

MARCUS stumbles on the icy ground Suddenly his feet go from
under him and he’s dragged along the ground by his hands

Scrabbling back to his feet he stumbles on Blood dribbles
from cuts to his thighs Still ESCA does not turn

EXT WESTERN HIGHLANDS - NIGHT

Through the dark of the encampment MARCUS walks the hoxses
to a stream to drink Behind him seated around a fire ESCA
and the SEAL PEOPLE eat and talk

Crouching down among the horses MARCUS cleans his cuts A
twinge of pain in his wounded leg makes him wince He
splashes his face with the water and tries to ignore it

EXT WESTERN HIGHLANDS DAY

An increasingly battered-looking MARCUS walks behind ESCA and
the SEAL PEOPLE elong the trail

Drifting into vision - like a slow swell - TRIBESMEN from
different clans begin to appear on the edge of the horizon
All of them are heading in the same direction north

EXT WESTERN HIGHLANDS - NIGHT

MARCUS crouches in the dark cleaning pots Ignoring hi
completely ESCA strolls past with the SEAL PRINCE talking
softly in Celt

This time the SEAL PEOPLE’s campfire has been augmented by
the fires of the other travelling TRIBESMEN They dot the
hillside creating a small village of firelight

EXT WESTERN HIGHLANDS -— DAY

High cover the coastal trail

The slow swell of TRIBESMEN has now become a steady stream
as differently decorated warriors converge on the Western
Isles

EXT WESTERN HIGHLANDS - COAST —- DAY

Rounding a bend in the trail ESCA pulls up MARCUS halts
Stretching away into the horizon are numberless islets
curling and counter-curling like hurled ribbons - blue sea
against white sand white sand against grey granite grey
granite against green

EXT WESTERN ISLES - SEAL PEOPLES VILLAGE -— EVENING

ESCA rides up the hill MARCUS walking behind on the end of
the rope He now looks badly beaten up from days of walking

They head towards the seal people’s village - a fortified
mound guarded by WATCHMEN

EXT WESTERN HIGHLANDS - SEAL PEOPLE’S VILLAGE - EVENING

Nearing the main gate MARCUS passes another avenue of skulls
lining the roadside - the same death-crop as in the killing
fields Some skulls are not fully rotted Flesh clings Hair
obtrudes

At the sight of the returning hunters the VILLAGERS pour
out to meet them They stare curiously at MARCUS CHILDREN
race alongside One of them dares to prod him He squeals
with happy fright and races away

EXT WESTERN HIGHLANDS - SEAL PEOPLE’S VILLAGE - EVENING

The SEAL PRINCE rides up to the central hut followed by
the others More death-crop skulls decorate the entrance

A crowd of TRIBESMEN and WOMEN gather to watch Finally
with a theatrical pause worthy of any Emperor the elderly
CHIEFTAIN appears in the doorway flanked by two of his
SONS He takes in the two strangers then returns his gaze
to the SEAL PRINCE Everyone waits respectfully for him to
speak

CHIEFTAIN
(celtic)
The hunting was good

SEAL PRINCE
(celtic)
It was good father

CHIEFTAIN
(celtic)
You wish me to eat these people too

The crowd giggles and the old man puckers his lips a stand-
up dead-panning his audience

SEAL PRINCE
(celtic)
I bring a guest Esca Druin eldest
son to the slain Chief of the
Brigantes And his slave A Roman

ESCA bows his head but the old CHIEFTAIN is staring at
MARCUS

CHIEFTAIN
(celtic)
Does the slave have a name
Nas

ESCA
Marcus

CHIEFTAIN
Marcus
(beat celtic)
I have brought many Romans back to
my village Marcus but never with
their head attached to their body

Another big laugh The old man smiles MARCUS whispers
nervously at ESCA

MARCUS
Whats he saying

ESCA
He says he’s brought many Romans back
to his village but never with their
heads attached to their bodies

MARCUS looks for some sort of reassurance but ESCA is
already gone MARCUS bows to the grinning old man

Cur TO

INT STABLES - EVENING

With night closing in MARCUS settles the horses in their
stables As he unsaddles them he becomes aware that he’s
being watched

A line of WOMEN and CHILDREN stand in the shadows of the
doorway staring at him with wary curiosity Each move of his
saddle brush is echoed by a delicate shift cf their heads
Beautiful still faces decorated with sophisticated
curlicues like miniature copies of the ribboned islets

INT CHLEFTAINS HUT - NIGHT

MARCUS hesitates on the threshold of the Chieftains hut
He’s caught by the sight of a huge fire burning in the
centre Smoke rises into the roof creating a fog-like
screen MARCUS can just make out the ROYAL FAMILY drifting
about chatting and drinking

FLASH TO

MARCUS’S VISION INT CAVE OF MITHRAS - NIGHT

From the same acute dream-angle as the earlier
flashbacks we see MARCUS’S FATHER moving about behind
the flames of an altar fire chatting with other ELDERS

BACK TO

INT CHIEFTAINS HUT - NIGHT

MARCUS blinks back the vision struggling to centre himself
Ahead of him the ROYAL FAMILY mill about Nervously MARCUS
lifts takes a first tentative step into the hut

FLASH TO

MARCUS’S VISION INT CAVE OF MITHRAS — NIGHT

Behind the altar fire stands a stone effigy of the god
Mithras Emerging through the smoke MARCUS’S FATHER turns
slowly in our direction He is about to face us when

BACK TO

INT CHIEFTAINS HUT - NIGHT

MARCUS jolts back from the second vision Before he can
recover ESCA passes MARCUS grabs his arm shaken angry

MARCUS
Esca-

ESCA
Let go of my arm

MARCUS
What do you think you’re doing You
let them drag me here like an
animal and you don’t even tell me
why theyre doing it They could be
about to kill me for all I know

ESCA
(voice level avoiding his eye)
If they see you speaking to me like
this they’1l kill both of us
(beat)
Youre my slave now Act like one

MARCUS pulls back a fraction but only a fraction

MARCUS
I need to know where I stand

ESCA
The Eagles somewhere here The men
from the other tribes are gathered
for the feast of the New Spears
When that happens we‘1ll learn more

MARCUS
How long will that be

ESCA
BR few days

MARCUS
What do we do until then

ESCA
We wait

MARCUS sighs with frustration A beat

MARCUS
Just remember why youre here

MARCUS searches ESCA’s face ESCA stares ahead face
expressionless His eyes flick to the fire The SEAL PRINCE
is watching them steadily

SEAL PRINCE
(celtic)
Esca Come Join us

ESCA moves off MARCUS gets into step behind him head bowed
respectfully Suddenly mid-walk it strikes him

MARCUS
What does a good slave do here

ESCA
(pointediy)
Exactly what I did for you

INT CHIEFTAINS HUT -— NIGHT

YOUNG WOMEN and CHILDREN serve food on exquisitely decorated
silver platters Chief among the YOUNG WOMEN is the beautiful
Gaughter of the Royal Family MOYRA

MARCUS stands behind ESCA’s chair in a direct reversal of
their previous roles Now it’s him whos fetching and
pouring the wine while ESCA talks to his hosts

As MARCUS stands there he lets the conversation drift over
his head The CHIEFTAIN gets up from his place to make a
point For a moment he’s hidden behind the fire then

FLASH TO

INT CHIEFTAINS HUT - NIGHT

MARCUS’S FATHER turns This time he faces us directly With a
sweet paternal smile he beckons us to join him

BACK TO

INT CHIEFTAINS HUT NIGHT
The CHIEFTAIN sits back in his chair
MARCUS tries to control his breathing He glances frantically

about Nobody else has noticed except him But he saw it It
was real His father

INT CHIEFTAINS HUT - NIGHT

ESCA is following the ROYAL FAMILY out of the hut when MARCUS
grabs his arm unable to contain himself any longer

MARCUS
He’s here My father’s here I saw
him He’s here

ESCA
(spitting at him tugging free)
Not now

The SEAL PRINCE glances back ESCA hurries after him
muttering an apology under his breath

MARCUS can still barely contain himself He stands in the
shadows watching everyone drift away fists clenched against
the wall Finally he turns to the empty hut

Nobody but him and the embers of the fire

MARCUS
Father

Silence

CUT TO

EXT SEAL PEOPLES VILLAGE - DAY

Under a beautiful sky MARCUS watches ESCA laughing with the
SEAL PRINCE and other members of the ROYAL FAMILY They ride
off with a party of hunters thundering out through the gates
and up the hillside

EXT SEAL PEOPLES VILLAGE —- DAY

Alone and ignored MARCUS crouches in the doorway of a hut
watching CHILDREN play in the mud

EXT SEAL PEOPLES VILLAGE — DAY

MARCUS watches ESCA walking through a group of VILLAGERS with
the SEAL PRINCE

The Chieftain’s daughter MOYRA and other YOUNG WOMEN point
and giggle at the handsome new warrior The SEAL PRINCE
points this out to his companion and ESCA laughs warming
with each new beat to the life he once had

INT CHIEFTAINS HUT NIGRT

A council of war The CHIEFTAIN sits with the TRIBAL ELDERS
TRIBAL PRINCES stand behind ESCA amongst them In a third
outer circle MARCUS and other SERVANTS wait behind their
respective masters

The young SEAL PRINCE presents his case from the centre

SEAL PRINCE
(celtic)
Now is the time to strike Bring
the great bird south and complete
the victory of our clan brothers
fifteen years ago

A clatter of spears from the TRIBAL PRINCES The ELDERS
confer The CHIEFTAIN raises his hand for silence

CHIEFTAIN
(celtic)
At the ceremony of the New Spears
we will ask the The Horned One If
ke blesses your request we will
march south

A howl of approval from the TRIBAL PRINCES

Through the roar of voices MARCUS looks up to find the SEAL
PRINCE staring straight at him Cold eyes Watching

EXT STREAM BY THE ISLET - DAY

Next day

MARCUS is washing pots in a stream when he observes MOYRA
again

She’s huddled together with a crowd of high caste YOUNG WOMEN
on the hillside watching ESCA and other YOUNG WARRIORS
bathing off the islet

ESCA looks up and meets MOYRA’s eye He smiles

SEAL PRINCE 0S
(celtic)
You

MARCUS spins round The YOUNG WOMEN scramble away terrified
The SEAL PRINCE bears down on MARCUS lifting him bodily off
the ground and hurling him against the hillside

SEAL PRINCE
(celtic)
Take your eyes off her slavel

Instinctively MARCUS flinches body bent low in the posture
of the low-caste

ESCA hurries over calling out

ESCA
(celtic)
Whats the matter

The SEAL PRINCE glares down at MARCUS spear poised

SEAL PRINCE
(celtic)
He had his eyes on my sister

ESCA
(celtic)
He meant nothing by it

A pause The SEAL PRINCE - those still eyes observing

SEAL PRINCE
(celtic)
How do I know hes not a spy

ESCA
(celtic)
He swore allegiance to me

The SEAL PRINCE spits in disgust

SEAL PRINCE
(celtic)
I dont trust the word of a Roman
All Romans are savages If you have
seen - as I have seen - what they
do to their prisoners Such people
are not to be trusted

ESCA
(celtic)
He would not dare to disobey me

But the SEAL PRINCE still isn’t satisfied

With a flick of his finger ESCA beckons MARCUS over The two
of them stand there eye to eye in front of the SEAL PRINCE

ESCA (CONT‘D)
Kneel in front of him
(beat)
Do it

MARCUS stares into ESCA’s eyes Slowly he turns and kneels
in front of the SEAL PRINCE Without warning ESCA pulls back
his head bearing MARCUS’s neck to the warricr

Absolute silence
Everything still

For a long moment the SEAL PRINCE stares down at MARCUS
Finally he nods and waiks away

ESCA releases his grip Angrily MARCUS pulls himself up

MARCUS
What was that for

ESCA
You insulted him I had no choice
but to offer you as a kill

Before MARCUS can recover ESCA walks off

Cut TO

INT CHIEFTAINS HUT - NIGHT

A strange energy has overtaken the evening meal As usual
JOMEN and CHILDREN serve food but the assembly is now much
larger TRIBAL CHIEFS from the gathering clans pack the room
gome gitting some standing

The CHIEFTAIN rises He begins reciting a low incantation
cups of a narcotic brew are ceremoniously drunk The SEAL
PRINCE offers one to ESCA He drinks then rocks back with
the shock of the drug

MOYRA rises from her place Deliberately she takes a tray
from one of the serving WOMEN and carries it to ESCA Watched
by everyone she serves ESCA his food ESCA blinks into her
delicately down-turned face In his eyes it’s clear ESCA
feels for this girl

MARCUS watches fearful of ESCA’s betrayal Suddenly

FATHER (VO)
Marcus

MARCUS spins round That was his father right beside him

MARCUS
Father

A crowd of TRIBAL WARRIORS pack the doorway stonedeyes
staring MARCUS searches madly for a sign of his father
Nothing Panicked he pushes forward

EXT SEAL PEOPLES VILLAGE NIGHT

MARCUS bursts out of the hut and stops What confronts him is
a completely different human landscape

Hundreds of torches light the hillside Drums beat a low
bass pulse All the children have vanished WOMEN huddle in
doorways rocking in ritual grief They begin a low wailing
first one then another and another

Beyond the women come the YOUNG WARRIORS ghosts made flesh
their whole bodies daubed grey-biue with mud They pour into
the village from the surrounding hillside crowding into clan-
groups between the huts TRIBAL ELDERS hand out horn-shaped
cups and the YOUNG WARRIORS drink

Pushing past MARCUS the SEAL PRINCE bursts out of the
chieftains hut A howl goes up from the waiting WARRIORS

MARCUS turns to find ESCA standing right behind him his body
bathed in sweat

MARCUS
Whats happening

ESCA
(staring straight ahead)
Tts started

CUT TO

EXT PATH BEYOND THE SEAL PEOPLES VILLAGE -— NIGHT
The silent rush of bodies Feet pounding Breathing hard

The throng of torchlit YOUNG WARRIORS floods out of the
village streaming down the hillside towards the sea

EXT VALLEY TO THE HOLY ISLAND - NIGHT

Sweeping high the camera glides just above the throng of
YOUNG WARRIORS as they rush towards the shoreline their
torches bobbing and weaving in the dark

EXT VALLEY TO THE HOLY ISLAND — NIGHT

MARCUS races behind ESCA jostled by the pressure of grey-
blue bodies like myriad soldier-ghosts hurtling into battle

EXT THE SHORELINE TO THE HOLY ISLAND - NIGHT

Racing over the brow of the hill the ghost-army floods down
the hillside towards the beach Separated from the shoreline
by a stretch of water stands a small island

EXT THE SHORELINE TO THE HOLY ISLAND - NIGHT

MARCUS reaches the beach surrounded by YOUNG WARRIORS Drums
beat The YOUNG WARRIORS face the island thrashing the air
with their spears In the confusion MARCUS loses sight of
Esca

MARCUS
Esca Esca
(searching madly)
Esca

MARCUS races along the shoreline but ESCA has vanished
Before he can look any further the YOUNG WARRIORS let out
another cry

One by one the TOTEMS of each tribe shuffle out of the
shadows trance-like into the torchlight Each TOTEM is
naked except for a pelt of animal skin or the head-dress of
a bird As every tribe recognises its totem another roar
goes up There’s a seal an otter a wolf a bear They
scuffle and bound about the shoreline their animal skins
swinging behind them

There is no music only the pounding of drums Slowly as the
dance builds to a frenzy the drums become a single roar of
noise and thenMARCUS feels his throat tighten

Walking across the surface of the sea towards him comes a
figure of nightmare beauty

Wearing a cloak of eagle feathers his face masked his head
crested with antlers comes THE HORNED ONE He is accompanied
by ASSISTANTS bearing torches The torchlight bounces off the
water making it seem as if the sea itself is burning

Nearing the shore THE HORNED ONE stops and raises his hands

Like wheat under a scythe all the tribes fall to their knees
face down MARCUS hits the ground

The drums halt

A stunning silence broken only the “hush” of the sea

Moving his gaze from one side of the shore to the other THE
HORNED ONE takes them all in Torchlight fires the tips of his
antlers Everything about him radiates God-spirit He brings
his hands down and the drums begin again even louder than
before Manic thunder

MARCUS feels the earth pounding under him Helpless he lifts
his head to see

Drawn slowly from beneath his feathered cloak THE HORNED ONE
holds up a great shaft

Catching the moonlight - proud wings rising skyward - are the
battered remains of the Eagle of the Ninth

FLASHBACK TO

EXT FOREST —- CALEDONIA — DAY

The third angle - the final angle - right on the shoulder of
MARCUSS FATHER sprinting for his life through the forest
Fear is etched in his eyes Mud spatters his cheeks spittle
flecks his lips In panic he hurls away the Eagle

CUT TO

EXT THE SHORELINE TO THE HOLY ISLAND - NIGHT

The drums roar The YOUNG SPEARS thrash their weapons Once
more MARCUS searches for Esca

MARCUS
Esca

Nothing Only the Eagle mocking him from the across the sea
and his father mocking him with imagined cowardice

Shocked and numbed by a sense of defeat MARCUS slumps back
on the sand At his side lies a discarded gourd half-full of
the narcotic He stares at it a moment then grabs the gourd
and drinks it down

EXT THE SHORELINE TO THE HOLY ISLAND - NIGHT

Hours later

From high and wide we look down on the beach Embers of
fires dot the shoreline remnants of last night’s party The
place resembles a battlefield with bodies strewn across the
beach under blankets or curled beside the embers
Everywhere gourds of narcotic lie abandoned on the ground

Gradually as we look down on this scene we become aware of
a solitary FIGURE racing silently across the body-strewn
beach The FIGURE darts between the sleeping WARRIORS making
no sound

EXT THE SHORELINE TO THE HOLY ISLAND — NIGHT

MARCUS lies asleep on the shore Suddenly ESCA is leaning
over him shaking him awake

ESCA
(whispering)
Wake wp It’s time

MARCUS opens his eyes still bleary from the narcotic ESCA
splashes his face with water He splutters awake

ESCA (CONT’D)
We have to go tonight It’s our only
chance While they’re all asleep
MARCUS frowns

MARCUS
I thought I’d lost you to them

ESCA
(beat)
Come Lets go

EXT CAUSEWAY TO THE HOLY ISLAND -— NIGHT

MARCUS and ESCA race across the causeway in the moonlight
Like birds in flight they fly across the waters skin
EXT CAUSEWAY TO THE HOLY ISLANDCAVE ENTRANCE - NIGHT
Nearing the island MARCUS and ESCA slow

Facing them is a wall of jagged rocks The black mass of it
rears up above them silhouetted against the stars On the

threshold MARCUS holds up his hand He listens

Under the thick silence - almost imperceptible - comes the
sound of exhalation like a great beast breathing
84

ESCA
Just the wind

MARCUS nods Neither looks at the other

MARCUS
You have the flint

ESCA nods He steps up to a sealskin curtain hanging across
an opening in the cliff wall The edges are decorated with
heavy bronze discs each etched with complex curlicues
MARCUS prepares himself to step inside Softly he addresses
the dark

MARCUS (CONT’D)
In the name of Mithras the Father

He pulls back the thick animal skin and slips inside

INT CAVE ENTRANCE -— NIGHT

ESCA steps in behind MARCUS The curtain falls back
Total blackness

Only the sound of their breathing low fast

MARCUS
(whispered)
Light quick

A scuffle in the dark A moment then a spark In the
sparklight we glimpse ESCA’s nervous face lowered over the
fire-pot and wick Nothing Another spark This time it
catches Slowly ESCA’s bent face grows out of the dark
nursing the tiny flame As it steadies he hands it to MARCUS
who raises it above his head

In the blur of the swinging lamp the passageway is revealed
What is immediately startling is its absolute rawness It is
simply a fissure in the rock As far as the light will
travel there is no clear path only a meandering pot-holed
crevice leading sharply downward No decoration No sign of
man

MARCUS and ESCA step forward

INT PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

As MARCUS and ESCA walk further in the passageway narrows to
the point where they have to crawl on hands and knees The
sense of claustrophobia is intense The tiny lamp swings
wildly as they struggle across the uneven surface

VL

INT CENTRAL CAVE NIGHT

Finally the passageway opens out into a huge underground
cave Bround the sides run cracks rock-splits tiny caverns
and false passageways It’s like the chamber of a heart fed
by myriad veins

MARCUS drops to a crouch and starts clambering down

The cave is almost totally empty No altar No skulls Just a
single raised flagstone in the very centre on top of which
rests a shallow amber cup filled to the brim with blood

ESCA tenses nervously

ESCA
Don’t touch it

MARCUS
I’m not about to
(beat)
The Eagle’s somewhere in here

They begin moving round the edge of the cave searching the
crevices Nothing Finally they come to another anonyrous
cleft in the rock wall and there it is

MARCUS holds up the light

Blotted dark against the stones propped a little drunkenly

stands the staff and head of the Eagle of the Ninth

MARCUS hands ESCA the light He hesitates hand poised above
the shaft Running his hands softly over the dented wood he
seeks the soldier’s double grip then pulls it clear of the
wall

In the shadow-light MARCUS holds up the Eagle of the Ninth

ESCA
Let’s go

MARCUS
Not the shaft Only the Eagle

ESCA
We can break the shaft when we’re
out of here

MARCUS

ESCA
why

MARCUS
The Eagle will fly
(beat)
I want them to know it

MARCUS pulls out a dagger positions the shaft over his knee
and begins levering at the first of four bronze pegs securing
the talons to the wooden shaft Each one has become corroded
into its hole He digs out the first then pockets the peg
The second the same The third wont budge He tries
levering again His hand slips and he cuts himself Blood
trickles in tiny rivulets along his finger-grip He blinks at
the peg forcing himself to concentrate over the pain

MARCUS (CONTD)
Slowly

At last the third peg comes out As he turns to the final
peg the light from the fire-pot suddenly flickers out in a
breeze

MARCUS (CONTD)
(whispers)
What was that

Torchlight flickers towards them down the tunnel MARCUS and
ESCA freeze The lights come nearer They draw their swords

Keeping his eyes on the approaching enemy MARCUS whispers

MARCUS (CONTD)
Wherever your faith went we need it now

Two YOUNG WARRIORS appear across the cave holding torches
Between them stands THE HORNED ONE masked and robed

Before they can raise their swords ESCA leaps forward
killing the nearest YOUNG WARRIOR instantly His torch smacks
to the ground still burning

The second YOUNG WARRIOR steps in front of his master who
turns to run

While ESCA and the YOUNG WARRIOR fight MARCUS races to block
off any escape route He just manages to reach the tunnel and
turn as THE HORNED ONE draws a sword from inside his cloak
and stabs wildly at him MARCUS parries They fight on

Against an onslaught of blows MARCUS is caught off balance
and bangs sideways into the cave wall A shock of pain roars
up his leg He forces himself up only just avoiding another
blow All the time he can see the emerald ring flashing
against the hilt of his opponents sword

Again THE HORNED ONE lunges forward MARCUS spins aside

Carried by his own momentum his opponent bangs up against
the far side of the cave wall smashing into the rock The
mask clatters to the ground

Silence

MARCUS stares at the other man’s back The ring on his sword
hand glitters

A pause

MARCUS (CONT’D)
Father

Slowly the other man turns his face to reveal
The CHIEFTAIN

MARCUS feels anger rising inside him like a torrent Letting
out a cry of disappointment he stabs wildly into the folds
of the feathered cloak The CHIEFTAIN drops to his knees
MARCUS bends forward breathing hard He pushes the CHIEFTAIN
up against the cave wall grabs his ring-hand and presses the
emerald wp to his face

MARCUS (CONT’D)
This is my father’s ring Where did
you get it

The CHIEFTAIN lifts his head and spits a gob of blood at
MARCUS MARCUS smacks him across the face

MARCUS (CONT’‘D)
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY FATHER1

The old man blinks indifferently
CHIEFTAIN
(celtic)
How should I know It was just another
dead Roman

The CHIEFTAIN dies

MARCUS hangs there a moment everything colliding Finally
he pulls off the ring He turns to ESCA

MARCUS
What did he say

ESCA
Nothing

MARCUS

He said something-

ESCA
Go We have to go
(beat)
Go

MARCUS turns back yanks the last peg out of it’s socket and
grabs the Eagle

EXT CAVE ENTRANCE —- DAWN

MARCUS and ESCA lurch out of the barrow bloodied and dazed
In the distance the first streak of dawn-light fringes the
horizon ESCA grimaces

ESCA
We took too long
(beat)
Cant risk the causeway They may
be awake

MARCUS
Where are the horses

ESCA
Far side of the beach

ESCA races into the sea MARCUS slips the emerald ring on his
finger then plunges after him

EXT SHORELINE - DAWN

MARCUS and ESCA gallop along the mainland shore Behind them
the holy island gradually diminishes

EXT WESTERN ISLETS DAWN

Racing along the shoreline MARCUS and ESCA suddenly pull up
Running towards them over the crest of a hill comes the
Chieftain’s daughter MOYRA She’s still in her nightclothes

a cloak billowing out around her

MARCUS
What’s she doing there

ESCA
I don’t know

MARCUS
It could be a trap

ESCA
No Wait here

ESCA rides up to meet her She stops a few paces off staring
at him with strange intent

MOYRA
(celtic)
I knew Id meet you again

ESCA
(celtic)
How did you know we were gone

MOYRA
(celtic)
My heart woke me

ESCA
(celtic)
Is anyone with you

She shakes her head MOYRA stares up at him perplexed
MOYRA
(celtic)
I thought you felt for me
ESCA
(beat celtic)
Im sorry

She gives a little blink of hurt keeping herself still A
beat

MOYRA

(celtic)
Are you afraid Im going to tell

ESCA stares No move
Behind him MARCUS rides up voice low
MARCUS
We have to do something We can’t
risk her raising the alarm

ESCA refuses to look at him

ESCA
Don’t even think it

MARCUS
Remember the Eagle

ESCA
You do not touch her

MARCUS
Esca

MARCUS puts a hand to his arm ESCA snatches it away
MARCUS (CONT’‘D)
Think what you like about me but
you know Im right If she raises
the alarm were dead Our only
chance of survival is if they don’t
find the bodies until sunlight

ESCA
Do you trust me

MARCUS
She has no reason to protect us

ESCA
(harder)
Do you trust me
A long pause Eye to eye
MARCUS
(no)
Yes

ESCA
She wont betray us

MARCUS and ESCA stare at each other MARCUS kicks his
horse on

Our best chance is to head for the
forest keep the coast to our right

MARCUS
How many days to the wall

ESCA
If we ride hard four maybe five

MARCUS stares off Silence
ESCA (CONT’D)
Why didn’t you tell me you were

wounded

MARCUS
Its just a fali

ESCA
Let me look at it

MARCUS
We should-

ESCA

The horses need to rest

ESCA dismounts Reluctantly MARCUS climbs down Even the
slightest weight on his wounded leg is incredibly painful

ESCA (CONT’D)
Here

MARCUS lays himself on the ground ESCA pulls back the folds
of MARCUS’s cloak to reveal a bloody cut running the length

of his thigh Immediately he begins washing it with water

applying a salve

ESCA (CONT‘D)
When did this happen

MARCUS
In the cave coming out

ESCA
Its not deep but the skin’s still
tender there Can you walk on it

MARCUS
No

ESCA
(avoiding his eye)
As long as the horses hold out
well be fine With luck we can
steal more

He continues cleaning the wound MARCUS watches him

A pause

MARCUS
In the cavethe old manwhat
did he say

ESCA

Does it matter

MARCUS
To me Yes

ESCA
He said he wore the ring to honour the
man who died defending the Eagle

MARCUS stares down at the side of ESCA’s face Even though
in his heart he knows this to be a lie the deeper meaning
of the moment - the act of kindness - eclipses it

MARCUS
Thank you

ESCA carries on working

EXT MOORLAND - EVENING

ESCA and MARCUS ride fast across open moorland In the
distance lies a line of thick forest stretching the length
of the horizon like an inviting curtain

Gradually above the pounding of hooves they hear it

The faintest bray of hunting dogs carried across the wind

ESCA turns in his saddle Head slanted he listens

ESCA
Theyre coming

MARCUS
How far

ESCA

Two passes back at least The wind
always lies

MARCUS
How could they be so quick
ESCA
(avoiding his eye)
They’re half a day’s march away As
long as we keep ahead

MARCUS
The dogs can still track us

ESCA
Even they can’t run forever Hya

ESCA kicks on his horse flying forward MARCUS reins round
and gallops after him

EXT MOORLAND - EVENING

Close-up on MARCUS riding at full gallop The sweep of the
horse’s head in the wind the reins held high the sky-
skimming past - like a dark re-playing of the first glorious
chariot ride

EXT EDGE OF THE FOREST - DUSK

Bursting from light into dark ESCA and MARCUS crash into the
safety of the forest MARCUS lets out a cry of relief They
gallop on

EXT FOREST - NIGHT

Cantering through the dark MARCUS and ESCA weave in and out
of vision between the moonlit trees

EXT FOREST NIGHT

Hours later they are still riding

MARCUS starts to fall asleep in the saddle Slipping
slightly he jerks awake ESCA rides alongside He hands

MARCUS some smoked meat

Eating on the hoof they ride on

EXT LEAF - DAWN

Extreme close-up on a veined leaf glistening with rainwater
MARCUS leans in and licks the moisture away He’s kneeling
under the trees like a supplicant licking at the leaves

EXT FOREST - DAWN

ESCA empties his sack of the last of their dried meat and
throws half to MARCUS They eat quickly in silence

ESCA
Well rest here

ESCA drops to the ground where he’s standing MARCUS simply
curls on the ground Both instantly asleep

EXT FOREST - NIGHT

Darkness MARCUS wakes with a start His hand snaps to the
Eagle ESCA is leaning over him sword in hand For a split-
second MARCUS thinks he’s going to kill him ESCA sees the

fear and frowns

ESCA
Time to go

MARCUS pulls himself up He winces involuntarily his
wounded leg is stiff from sleep Without a word ESCA helps
him onto the horse

EXT HIGHLANDS - NIGHTDAYNIGHT

A series of angles on MARCUS and ESCA’s long ride south At
every point the pace is brutal the landscape unforgiving

Faintly in the distance - just like the low drumbeat at the
opening — the braying of hounds drifts to the sound-surface

cur TO

EXT HIGHLANDS - DAWN

A few days later

A rustle of leaves HANDS scuttle along the ground Suddenly
ESCA’S FACE fills the screen low to the ground He freezes
then darts forward both hands outstretched A second later
he sits back holding a wood vole

EXT HIGHLANDS - DAY

Hidden in a thicket of thorn trees MARCUS and ESCA crouch
over the skinned rodent staring at the meagre flesh Both

look increasingly wrecked with hunger and exhaustion

Without moving MARCUS starts collecting bits of firewood

ESCA
No fires Too risky

MARCUS
I can’t eat it raw

ESCA
You don’t have a choice

MARCUS
I’m not a savage

ESCA
Then die a Roman I don’t care

ESCA snatches up the raw meat and bites into it MARCUS
stares appalled yet achingly hungry

Furious he turns away to sleep Remembering the nervous tick
that lets him sleep he pulls the Eagle from its sack and
buries it inside his cloak

ESCA (CONTD)
(contemptuously)

What are you afraid of That I‘11

steal it

MARCUS
(without turning)
We should never have let that girl go

ESCA glares at his back refusing to answer Both of them
never further apart than now

EXT HIGHLANDS — DAWN

MARCUS and ESCA are nearing the end of another exhausting
nights riding Starved and sleep-deprived they seem to be
disintegrating slowly into the land around them

ESCA
Ttll be light soon Well look for
a place to rest

MARCUS
How many more days to the wall

ESCA is about to answer when suddenly his head jerks up He
stares at the hills behind them MARCUS turns to look

As he does so the horizon begins to wriggle with the shapes
of riders - dozens of them - heading straight towards us

ESCA
(berating himself
The wind’s changed No sound Hya

MARCUS
Hyal

Two eries and they’re away flying across the moorland - so
sudden and undisguised that a flock of plover startle into an
explosion of wings scudding skyward in all directions

EXT THE HIGHLANDS DAWN

Tight on MARCUS‘s shoulder The dark heather streaking
backwards The horse’s main spraying over his wrists The
spittle in his mouth The backward glance And the fear Deep
fear Of being hunted

EXT RIVERBANK - DAWN

Cresting another ridge ESCA and MARCUS pull up Below them
a river meanders through heavy copse Half-hidden amid the
trees a stag drinks

ESCA
Down to the stream

Neck and neck they hurtle down the hillside sending the
stag running

EXT RIVER - DAWN

Flying through coppice the horses crash into the river It
surges around them pouring downstream

Immediately ESCA dismounts and begins dragging both horses
towards the far bank As he reaches the end he yells above
the roar of water

ESCA
The sack

MARCUS scrambles for his sack He dismounts Pain shoots up
his leg He grits his teeth

ESCA beats at the horses backsides yelling furiously at
them The terrified animals scramble up the bank and gallop
away

ESCA (CONT’D)
Take my arm

Wincing against the pain MARCUS hesitates

ESCA (CONT’D)
TAKE MY ARM

Finally furiously MARCUS takes ESCA’s arm

Locked together they stumble downstream

EXT RIVER - MORNING

With the braying of the dogs growing louder all the time
MARCUS and ESCA continue wading downstream ESCA searches the
pankside for a hiding place At last he sees a rocky
overhang covered in alder scrub and moss

ESCA
In here

They push in under the curtain of vegetation

EXT OVERHANG - MORNING

MARCUS and ESCA cling to the edge of the bank water swirling
and bubbling against their clothes The curtain of vegetation
hangs loosely in front of them MARCUS sniffs

MARCUS
Whats that smell
ESCA
The stag Confuses the dogs

(beat)
Stay as low as you can

MARCUS grips the Eagle inside its drenched sack-skin
Lowering himself down he lets the water rise up to his
mouth

They wait

Close on MARCUS and ESCA as the hunters descend Second by
second a terrifying cacophony envelopes them The sound of
barking then the thunder of hooves then the first splash-
crash of the dogs hitting the water The sudden yelp as they
pick up the stag scent A few beats later comes the smash of
the horses hitting the river the yell of the hunters urging
on the dogs the sound of hooves crashing past only feet
away Everything rising to a crescendo of sound then

Like a dissolving nightmare men hounds and horses fly
downstream The crescendo of yelps and cries fades away
until

The only sound is the water lap-lapping against their lips

Cautiously they ease themselves back onto the bank
Drenched shaken and exhausted they catch their breath

MARCUS
How long before they turn back

ESCA
Depends how far our horses run Once
they track them down they’1l be onto
us again We’ll follow the river
upstream as far as we can With luck
we may find some ponies

Neither looks at the other

ESCA slips back into the water MARCUS eases himself down
Tentatively he puts weight on his wounded leg Another shot
of pain slams into him Immediately ESCA steps up one arm
around his waist

BXT THE RIVER — DAY

ESCA and MARCUS wade slowly upstream

EXTINT THE RIVER - DAY

The river narrows and the current gets stronger MARCUS slips
and crashes into the water ESCA loses his grip

Suddenly MARCUS is under the water his whole body streaming
backwards with the current

ESCA thrashes madly after him

MARCUS is drowning He can feel himself giving into it
Suddenly ESCA grabs his arm and hauls him back to the
roaring surface They stand there drenched and shaking
elinging onto each other

EXT THE RIVER — DAY

Hours later Rain pours

The further they wade against the run of the river the

weaker MARCUS becomes He’s breathing fast Shallow gasps
against the constant pain ESCA stops

ESCA
Rest

MARCUS
No

ESCA
Rest

MARCUS

No

ESCA has to fight MARCUS out of the river He half-drags
half-carries him up the bank and into a moorland clearing
between the trees

EXT HIGHLANDS MOORLAND CLEARING - DAY

MARCUS pulls free Hes shaking with exhaustion and rage The
rain is now so fierce it drums down in a constant roar They
have to shout to be heard

MARCUS
It’s no good
(beat)
I can’t go on without a horse

He pulls the Eagle out of his sack
MARCUS (CONTD)
Take it If you find horses come
back if not keep south

ESCA
Im not leaving you here

MARCUS
I order you

Nothing ESCA stares back

MARCUS (CONT’D)
Do you hear me Esca I order you

MARCUS tries to hand him the Eagle ESCA steps back refusing
to take it

MARCUS (CONTD)
Take it

ESCA shakes his head retreating from MARCUS‘s advance

MARCUS (CONT’D)
Do not dishonour me

ESCA
If I meant you to die I could have
killed you myseif

MARCUS
Take itit

ESCA
I will not leave you

Furious MARCUS strikes out with the Eagle and stumbles
forward He kneels there in the mud rain pouring off his
body gripping the iron bird
A long pause The two of them head to head under the storm
Everything drawn down to this

MARCUS

The dead are dead The dead do not
come back I know that In my
heart I’ve always known that But
if you could see this piece of
metal as I see it If it could
speak to you as it speaks to me
youd understand To die for this
is to die for something so much
more than merely what we are

(looks at Esca)
This is the best of us This is
what we dream of being Can you not
see that Can you not grant me at
least that much faith

He stares up at ESCA The Celt towers over him
ESCA
Give me my freedom
(beat)
All this time Ive honoured you
and never once have you shown faith
in me You wish me to leave then
trust me to return
(beat)
Give me my freedom
Silence The roar of the rain drenching them both

Finally MARCUS slumps back His shoulders drop and he lets
it all gohis father Esca everything

MARCUS
Youre free

Drained and exhausted he holds out the Eagle
ButESCA shakes his head

ESCA
I will return

For a second their hands touch then ESCA races away

CuT TO

EXT HIGHLANDS - FOREST - DAY

With the grace of a deer in flight ESCA runs through the
forest

EET HIGHLANDS - MOORLAND LEBRING DAY

Limping across the clearing MARCUS makes for the shelter of
the trees

EXT HIGHLANDS - FOREST - DAY

ESCA pauses in his run Checking the snapped tendrils of some
alder scrub he changes direction

EXT HIGHLANDS - MOORLAND CLEARING - DAY

MARCUS searches among the trees hunting for something

EXT HIGHLANDS - FOREST — DAY

ESCA leaps bird-like over a rock-fall arms spread wide He
truly is flying

EXT HIGHLANDS - FOREST - DAY

Breaking off the base of a small coppice branch MARCUS
begins whittling it smooth with his dagger

EXT HIGHLANDS - FOREST - DAY

ESCA slows Again - with the same purpose as before - he
checks the ground and changes direction

EXT HIGHLANDS - MOORLAND CLEARING -— DAY

isting dry grass MARCUS makes a crude rope

EXT HIGHLANDS FOREST — DAY

ESCA approaches a hut hidden in a clearing

He passes some horses grazing in a fenced enclosure Instead
of stealing them he walks straight on towards the hut

EXT HIGHLANDS - MOORLAND CLEARING — DAY

MARCUS finishes tying the Eagle to the top of the whittled
branch The task complete he raises the handmade standard

The Eagle of the Ninth rises once more into the sky

EXT HIGHLANDS — HUT - DAY
Out of the shadows of his hut doorway steps GUERN

Staring back at him across the clearing breathing hard
stands a triumphant ESCA

CUT TO

EXT HIGHLANDS - MOORLAND CLEARING - EVENING
Hours later Evening light slants down in low shadows

MARCUS has fallen asleep over the Eagle He wakes to the
first faint bray of hounds

EXT HIGHLANDS - MOORLAND CLEARING - EVENING

With the sound of the hounds growing gradually louder MARCUS
limps as fast as he can towards higher ground In his hand
he carries the handmade standard

EXT HIGHLANDS - MOORLAND CLEARING DAY

Reaching the high ground MARCUS draws his sword and turns to
face his attackers The pain in his leg is agony but he
bites it back planting the standard firmly into the ground

The CELT WARRIORS do not come at him in a rush His stillness
makes them wary Instead they emerge out of the darkness of
the forest in one terrifying line of dogs and horsebacked
riders

There are about a hundred of them in all At their head rides
the SEAL PRINCE eyes fixed on MARCUS Slowly he raises his
spear and his men close in

MARCUS grips the standard holding his courage

Then the most amazing sight

Emerging through the trees on either side of MARCUS come
thirty wild-haired tattooed ghost-men their Roman swords
and shields held in perfect formation

Led by GUERN the THIRTY LEGIONARIES OF THE NINTH march into
a two sided triangle forming a wall of shields in front of
the Eagle

Stunned by the sight of Celtish Legionaries - like their own
parodies turned in on themselves - the CELT WARRIORS halt

ESCA rides up behind MARCUS shepherding a spare horse
shields and swords MARCUS stares in amazement at the
LEGIONARIES gathered round him

MARCUS
These men

ESCA
Your father’s Legionaries They’ve
come to defend the Eagle
(beat)
You were wrong The dead can live

ESCA hands MARCUS a sword and shield then prepares to fight

GUERN approaches MARCUS A look between them GUERN salutes
fist to his chest A beat

GUERN
The order sir

MARCUS hesitates then the command forms in his mouth

MARCUS
Prepare to form Testudo

GUERN and the LEGIONARIES close in around him

MARCUS (CONT’D)
FORM TESTUDO

MARCUS raises his shield to the sky

Instantly the LEGIONARIES bunch close and their shields
shoot up Again the kiss and click of metal completes and
the motley cohort is locked under the shieid-wall

Standing side by side MARCUS and ESCA prepare to charge
The sound of thirty men taking one breath

MARCUS (CONT‘D)
Steady boys Wait for them to
advance

Raising his feathered spear the SEAL PRINCE shcuts the
command and ONE HUNDRED CELT WARRIORS roar up the hill

MARCUS (CONT’D)
NOW

Led by MARCUS under the shadow of their Eagle the
LEGIONARIES OF THE NINTH charge forward

From high and wide we lock down once more on 4 fist of
metal slamming into a line of Celts
104

MARCUS (CONT‘D)
BREAK TESTUDO

The LEGIONARIES burst out of formation

MARCUS (CONTD)
OUT SWORDS
(drawing his sword)
CAESAR CAESAR

LEGIONARIES
CAESAR CAESAR

Shoulder to shoulder MARCUS and ESCA fight Beside them
GUERN and his LEGIONARIES battle with preternatural courage
to defend the standard they once abandoned Even as they fall
in its protection their faces carry the mask of absolute
certainty This is what they were destined to do

They may die but they will not lose

CUT TO

EXT HIGHLANDS - MOORLAND CLEARING — DAY

MARCUS and ESCA stand back to back on top of the hill
exhausted blood-spattered but victorious Around them -
some on their knees from exhaustion - stand a few surviving
LEGIONARIES Bodies are strewn everywhere GUERN lies among
the dead along with scores of CELTS

In his fist MARCUS still grips the handmade standard of the
Eagle of the Ninth On a look from ESCA he raises it to the
sky and a ragged heartfelt cheer goes up

Cut TO

EXT LOWLANDS —- DAY

From high and wide we look down on MARCUS and ESCA riding
back across a great expanse of lowland hills In the
distance Hadrian’s Wall appears snaking across the
countryside

EXT LOWLANDS - DAY

MARCUS and ESCA ride across a high ridge The great wall
looms close The end of their journey

MARCUS
Wait

MARCUS pulls up and dismounts Crouching on the ground he
begins cutting out a large square of turf with his dagger

Ee lays the turf beside the hole then pulls the Eagle out of
its sack

ESCA
What are you doing

MARCUS
I don’t need to hold it to know
it’s there It should remain with
the men who died defending it It
belongs to them not Rome

MARCUS lays the Eagle in the hole then covers it carefully
with the square of turf until it’s impossible to tell the
ground was ever disturbed

Pulling out the jar from his bag he murmurs his blessing
ever it then pours a cupful of water into his hand and
sprinkles the holy water over the resting place

MARCUS (CONT’D)
Here lies the Eagle of the Ninth
The last of the Lost Legion
(beat)
May their souls rest in peace and
honour follow them from here and
forever

The eound of a breath drawn out

ESCA stands above his friend both hands to his forehead
Slowly he opens them out palms upward offering the spirits
his blessing and the return of his faith

As he exhales his breath lifts into the sky becoming its
own music

EXT LOWLANDS - DAY

MARCUS and ESCA ride side-by-side heading south There’s a
new lightness now as if the weight of their story has
finally lifted

MARCUS
I forgot to give this back to you

MARCUS holds out the dagger ESCA takes it without comment
They ride for a while in silence

MARCUS (CONT’D)
Where will you go now

ESCA
Go
A pause

MARCUS
Youre a free man You could stay

ESCA
I’ve nothing to keep me here

ESCA (CONT’D)
What about you

MARCUS
Ill need to settle things with my
uncle After that I might look for
some land of my own A farm perhaps

ESCA
(distastefully)
Farming
MARCUS

What’s wrong with that

They begin riding away from us their voices fading

ESCA
Hunting maybe

MARCUS
I cant hunt all my life

ESCA
Horse breeding’s an honourable
profession

MARCUS
(laughs)
Horse breeding Inever want to see
another horse as long as I live

ESCA
There’s good money in it

MARCUS
What about Spain A farm in Spain

ESCA
A farm with horses in Spain

They ride on the huge sky above
