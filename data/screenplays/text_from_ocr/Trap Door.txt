FADE IN

A strip torn from a plastic bag flutters and twists in the
breeze like a live creature struggling to break free

It is snagged on the SAVAGE BARBS of serpentine wire that
coil atop the 20-foot fence This fence surrounds the

EXT PRISON COMPOUND - DAY

A maximum security facility isolated in a stretch of parched
California farmland The kind of place you drive quickly
past if youre lucky

INT PRISON CORRIDOR - DAY

Dim cold uncaring Silent except for the CLOMP of a
PRISON GUARDS SHOES as he passes by on his rounds As he
passes the window of a laundry room door

The face of a LATINO INMATE appears behind the glass
Keeping watch

INT LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

A LATINO PRISON GANG is working over a VICTIM The three
GANG MEMBERS have his head submerged in a large sink

They raise the victims head out He GASPS for breath The
victim is also an inmate White early 40s curly black
hair Everything about his smooth face and terrified eyes
says first timer

The LATINO GANGSTER leader a hardcore lifer wields a fist
showing off the ring on his finger A twisted spur of metal
rises out like a corkscrew

LATINO GANGSTER
You ran your mouth to those Aryan
crackerjacks Now you can run it
for me

VICTIM
I already told you where it is

The gangster carves a slice across the victims cheekbone
with the ring As the man HOWLS the gangster plunges his
head back under the water holds it there for several
seconds as the victims legs kick wildly

Finally he brings the victims face back out
LATINO GANGSTER
You think Im stupid ese I want
the exact location
(off his silence)
I guess you wanna die today

The victim knows hes dead either way He holds back The
gangster reaches for an open gallon of BLEACH He pours it
over the victims head As the victim HOWLS

LATINO GANGSTER
Stings dont it

The gangster dunks the victims face back under The other
inmates study their leader with fear Hes enjoying this too
much Air bubbles rise from the water The victims legs
stop kicking

INMATE
Dont kill him Aurelio said

The gangster raises the victims head His eyes are frozen
in death

LATINO GANGSTER
Shit

He drops the mans head They hustle out of there At the
bottom of the sink basin lies a pair of EYEGLASSES forever
separated from their owner

CUT TO
A PAIR OF CHIC MENS SUNGLASSES
Folded on the dash of a futuristic hybrid SUV
WE ARE
EXT HILLTOP HOME DRIVEWAY - DAY
A Spanish style estate with a loop driveway and fountain
Three-car garage and large picture windows An OPEN HOUSE
sign by the front door Looks like the Hotel California set
atop Mulholland Drive Two cars are parked at the curb --
the SUV and a Mercedes
EXT HILLTOP HOME BACKYARD - DAY
The home is built on the hillside Artistic stucco and tile

replete with arched doorways iron railings and red tile
roofing

Two terraced levels of backyard patios overlook a swimming
pool with a faux-rock waterfall and the sprawl of Hollywood
below

There is no question who drives the SUV -- MORGAN FISCHER
admires the view Morgan is an LA advertising executive He
defines high-end cosmopolitan trend His finger is welded to
the pulse Slick suit dangling wristwatch maybe too
handsome for his own good

Admiring the view with him is NAOMI FISCHER Naomi is hip in
a more spiritual way She feels the warm California breeze
against her face

The 60-ish REALTOR stands back and lets the property speak
for itself

REALTOR
The sheriffs auction is tomorrow
If youre interested stop by

NAOMI
Who was the owner a drug dealer
REALTOR
White collar criminal His luck
ran out
MORGAN

Well he had taste
Naomi is apprehensive but Morgan sees shining opportunity

NAOMI
I dont know Morgan Its
extravagant

MORGAN
Naomi This place is so us
(pointing down the hill)
Look An omen

Naomi peers down at the boulevard far below Traffic
crowded storefronts billboards one with an eye-popping
graphic and the NIKE swoosh

NAOMI
The Nike ad

MORGAN
Thats ours

Naomi gives Morgan a sidelong glare pretends to be put off
Secretly she is amused by him
They follow the realtor around the pool and waterfall They
enter through the glass doors to the recreation room on the
bottom floor

INT RECREATION ROOM - DAY

A large open space with white floor tiles and a spiral
staircase Naomi regards the large windows

NAOMI
You feel quite exposed in here

REALTOR
The house is designed to let you
see out to maximize the panorama

The realtor sweeps his arm at the view outside Morgan
studies the back wall covered in MIRROR TILES Four tiles
are missing in a cluster near the floor Newspaper has been
taped over the gap

MORGAN
Whats with the

REALTOR
Some damage from the property
seizure Police pulled some
evidence out of here

Naomi shoots Morgan a hesitant look

REALTOR
Were waiting on replacement tiles
Should be fixed within the week

Morgan nods Not an issue He follows the realtor up the
spiral stairs Naomi studies the mirrored wall a bit longer
before she climbs after them

EXT HILLTOP HOME BACKYARD - DAY
Through the windows of the second floor (street level) we
can see Morgan and Naomi eyeballing the layout They follow

the realtor up yet another flight of interior stairs

The third level of the house is a single room A turret with
a crows nest view of the property

INT TURRET OFFICE - DAY
Naomi and Morgan are now in this upper space with the vaulted

ceiling ending in a center point Morgan admires the deep
velvet carpet
MORGAN
This is the only room with
carpeting

REALTOR
It was recently installed

Naomi stares at the electrical outlets in the wall Six
outlets alongside six phone jacks two DSL jacks and a cable
feed Morgan notices

MORGAN
Damn Got the juice up here

REALTOR
I need to make a quick call

NAOMI
Well be down in a minute

Now that the realtor is gone husband and wife can compare
notes Morgan goes into a slick sales pitch

MORGAN
Think of where well be in a year
With the Apple and Target accounts
Ill be running the place

NAOMI

If you land the accounts
MORGAN

Youll have a three-book deal

(then)
We deserve this Weve passed up
other opportunities

Naomi averts her eyes at that last comment

NAOMI
Youve never been so confident in
my abilities before

MORGAN
Youve got a best-seller coming
out Look at this room This is
the office of a best-selling
novelist yeah

Naomi knows shes being played but she takes a moment to
dream with him Looking out the window it is like being on
top of the world
MORGAN
We make our own reality

NAOMI
Youre not worried

MORGAN
What We sold the other place We
need to reinvest the equity

NAOMI
But youre not worried about this
house of ill repute

MORGAN
The guy got pinched moving some
money around Its not like people
were killed here

He runs his hand along her back a tenacious puppy

MORGAN
We could snatch this place for a
fraction of its worth

NAOMI
(finally)
Well go to the auction but only
if you bring Bruce

MORGAN
Of course Bruce is the man He
knows the game

Morgan kisses her quickly He knows how to close the deal
EXT CENTURY CITY - DAY

The modern office towers are shielded by mirrored glass
keeping out the heat

INT ADVERTISING AGENCY - DAY

Bold designer colors on the walls EMPLOYEES in fashionable
casual wear hustle about with their chores humming with the
collective energy This place is happening

Morgan darts into one office then another collecting his
things Hes in a hurry His assistant ZOE attacks
from behind her cubicle wall Shes spunky with dyed
streaks in her hair
ZOE
Morgan Dont forget your four
oclock

MORGAN

Dont plan to
She thrusts a few message slips at him Morgan takes them
but never breaks stride Now hes hustling down the
corridor

ANTHONY appears Alpha male a step higher in the pecking
order This is who Morgan wants to be

ANTHONY
Morg Are you my guy

Morgan turns his head sees Anthony leaning out of his
office Several advertising MOCK-UPS are inside

MORGAN
You know I am

Morgan keeps walking Anthony follows him

ANTHONY
If the account is too much for your
plate

MORGAN

Im on it Anthony Im your guy

They approach the elevators in the lobby

ANTHONY
Can we talk
MORGAN
I gotta do this thing with the

auction

Morgan steps into the elevator turns around Anthony points
at him

ANTHONY
Apple You got three weeks to
bring them in for the landing

MORGAN
All over it Apples a done deal

The mirrored elevator doors close and Morgan is gone
AUCTIONEER (VO)
The bidding starts at two million

INT COURTROOM - DAY

BIDDERS crowd the seats as an AUCTIONEER reveals PowerPoint
slides of the hilltop property Several paddles go up in the
air Morgans is first

AUCTIONEER
I have two-point-one

Sitting beside Morgan are Naomi and BRUCE (early 50s) a real
estate attorney

NAOMI
(sotto)
You know what youre doing

MORGAN
Ive been to a couple of these that
Dale helped with

AUCTIONEER (0S)
I have two-point-three

As Bruce nudges him Morgan raises his paddle again

BRUCE
Dale
MORGAN
My moms last husband

The auctioneer focuses on Morgan and a MATRONLY WOMAN the
most aggressive buyers in the room

AUCTIONEER
Were now at two-point-four Whos
for a clean two-point-five

Morgans paddle goes up again Naomi notices a YOUNG LATINO
MAN studying her across the aisle He has a crew-cut like a
cop or serviceman going prematurely salt-n-pepper gray

EXT COURTHOUSE - DAY

Lunch hour in the civic center ATTORNEYS and GOVERNMENT
EMPLOYEES purchase food from a sidewalk HOT DOG VENDOR
Bruce hands a sheaf of papers to Morgan They shake hands
all smiles
BRUCE
Congratulations

Naomi is pleased but reserved Morgan slips on his stylish
shades and lights a cigarette

MORGAN
Whos wants a drink Im buying
NAOMI
Four million in the hole and youre
buying
BRUCE

Youve already made a profit on the
house Its worth five anda
quarter easy

MORGAN
Well never have to move again

Naomi nods to Morgans cigarette He shrugs

MORGAN
Old times sake

Naomi holds out her hand Morgan reluctantly digs the pack
from his coat pocket and forks it over

BRUCE
Listen to her Youll live longer

Morgan smiles But hes not looking at Bruce or Naomi His
view drifts past them past the hot dog vendor

To the crew-cut Latino gentleman who is climbing into the
passenger seat of a Jaguar sedan with dark windows He darts
a look back at Morgan and Naomi before closing the door

INT HILLTOP HOME - NIGHT

The Fischers SUV is in the circular drive A light glows in
the front window The real estate sign out front has a
SOLD placard below it

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Morgan and Naomi are alone in the large space Planning
ahead before the move The open floor plan connects the
rooms with spacious wood floors in the living and dining
areas A tile floor kitchen is at one end the bedrooms are
at the other

MORGAN
Its almost an illusion how
flawless it is

NAOMI
Like every tile brick and wood
grain was selected by artisans

A double-sided clay brick fireplace and chimney separates the
living room from the dining room but does not obstruct the
line of large bay windows that admit the twinkling lights of
the city below A galaxy unto itself

NAOMI
(pointing)
I see an area rug with the sofa and
coffee table
(then)
I dont like the walls We need a
warmer orange or gold

MORGAN
And a new artisan takes it to the
next level

Morgan grins as Naomis passion for the house finally
blossoms

NAOMI
We can always paint after the move
worst-case I want to be in before
the first

MORGAN
I could paint some of the rooms

Naomi gives him a knowing stare

NAOMI
Youre not going near a paint
brush I want this place to look
nice

Morgan bounces down the spiral staircase

INT RECREATION ROOM - NIGHT

Morgan activates the switch and recessed LIGHTS brighten the
room The attractively lit pool patio beckons through the

glass doors Morgan glances at the mirrored wall The
newspaper is gone The missing tiles have been replaced

MORGAN
This will be the gym Access to
the pool

Off to the right is a large guest bathroom also tiled
Morgan pokes his head into the guest bath

INT GUEST BATHROOM - NIGHT

An oversized shower and jacuzzi tub dominate the room which
is also fully tiled A wall bench runs below a set of towel
hooks Morgan and Naomi get acquainted with the room

NAOMI
You up for a swim

MORGAN
Tonight We dont have any

Naomi points to a set of white bath towels on the bench
Morgan is puzzled

NAOMI
Maybe the agent brought some
friends over for a dip

MORGAN
You still dont have a suit

NAOMI
Who needs a suit

Naomi starts to undress Morgan cant argue
EXT SWIMMING POOL - NIGHT

Naomi is already doing laps as Morgan turns off the exterior
floodlights Not that many neighbors would have a vantage
point to see them Morgan runs and dives in a dim naked
figure

LATER

Morgan and Naomi are in the deep end backlit by the
underwater dome light set in dark blue tiling Morgan clings
to the lip of the waterfall while Naomi straddles him They
kiss like two honeymooners

Suddenly the pool and deck are AWASH WITH LIGHT Morgan and
Naomi are startled The motion lights have come back on

MORGAN
What the hell

NAOMI
Theyre on a timer

MORGAN
No Something activated them

They sink lower in the water feeling very vulnerable
LATER

Morgan and Naomi have covered themselves with the towels
Morgan circles the deck looking out at the dark patches of
steep hillside all around A bush RUSTLES

MORGAN
It was an animal or something

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Just off the foyer corridor connecting the front door with
the main living room is a wet bar with a sunken bartender
pit A SECURITY KEYPAD blinks along the wall Morgan
fiddles with the buttons while reading a manual

He and Naomi are dressed again Naomi towels her damp hair

NAOMI
If you cant figure it out

MORGAN
It was armed when we came in We
should get in the habit of arming
it when we leave

PIERCING WHISTLES attack them High decibel sonic stings
Naomi covers her ears Morgan jabs at the keypad trying to
silence the alarm

As abruptly as it started it stops Naomi laughs spooked

MORGAN
Jesus

They share a look of surprise and relief

A sharp RAP (0OS) comes from the front door Naomi
cautiously approaches She opens the door to find JT CROSBY
(early 40s) in his security guard uniform Slight beer gut
beady eyes He stares hard at Naomi

JT
Olympus Security Can I ask what
your business is
His voice is weighted with a very slight Southern drawl

Naomi stares back He sure got there fast

NAOMI
Im Naomi Fischer My husband and
I just bought the house

JT
Sorry I wasnt notified

As Morgan approaches JT glides past Naomi into the house

JT offers a hand to Morgan first Man to man

JT
JT Olympus Security

MORGAN
Morgan Fischer Sorry about the
alarm

JT turns a keen eye back on Naomi

JT
Hows the water

Naomi shoots Morgan a dark look JT catches it

JT
Your hairs wet I assume you
didnt drop by to test the showers
(moving deeper inside)
That pool is tempting I was here
when Nolan put it in

JT surveys the empty rooms He has a certain small
sheriff swagger Both Naomi and Morgan notice that
carries a SIDEARM in his packed utility belt

MORGAN
So you knew the former owner

JT
(turning back to them)
I know everyone on the hill
Thats my job keeping everyone
safe Thats what your association
dues cover

Morgan moves back the keypad
MORGAN

I was trying to reprogram this
thing

town
JT

JT strolls over takes charge

oT
Lets erase the temporary code
Dont want those realtors coming in
and out as they please
(beat)
What do you want your code to be

Morgan and Naomi trade looks again JT senses their tension

oT
Ill show you how to change it
whenever you want

Morgan watches JT operate the keypad
INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

A modern culinary command center with stainless steel
appliances and glass-front cabinets Stark black white and
silver The Fischers have moved in A few boxes are still
stacked along various walls

SUPER THREE WEEKS LATER

Morgan shoulders a cell phone call while preparing a French
press coffee maker and service tray

MORGAN
Wheres my mock-up Zoe

INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Naomi is at the table with EVAN MAROS (mid-30s) a scholarly
Athenian Her editor Their body language suggests they are
good friends just finishing a home-cooked meal

EVAN
The place is gorgeous

NAOMI
It all happened so fast

The walls have been painted The place is starting to take
on their vibe Morgan finishes his call brings in the
coffee service

MORGAN
Sorry Weve got two big deals
hanging in the balance

EVAN
We were talking about the book

with the national release

Naomi pours the coffee

NAOMI
First ones on Thursday

MORGAN
Im going to be pulling twelve hour
days this week babe

NAOMI
(incredulous )
Youre not coming to my signing

MORGAN
Probably not this one

Morgan shrinks from her stare

MORGAN
Ill be at the next one

NAOMI
This is my first book My first
public event You know how hard
Evan and I have worked for this

Evan looks down Not going to jump in the middle

MORGAN
You know I support you one-hundred
percent

Naomi GRUNTS to herself Morgan watches Evan and Naomi
judging him in silence He moves to the windows stares down
at the city lights

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

The furniture is in place but open boxes are still evident
along with a few framed photos and paintings leaning against
the walls waiting to be hung Save for the city lights in
the window the glow of the alarm clock is the only
illumination 225 glows in gamma-green

Morgan is asleep Naomi is not She is wide awake
listening intently to something

Stealthy SCRAPING SOUNDS (0S) like picture frames being
slid along a wall

Naomi waits not daring to breathe Now she hears ELECTRONIC
BEEPING (0S)

Naomi shakes Morgan hard He rolls over

NAOMI
(sotto)
Morgan

Morgan sits up groggy

NAOMI
Someones in the house Hear that
beeping What is that

Morgan listens The BEEPING continues Fainter now Morgan
rolls out of bed and digs in an open moving box He pulls
out a titanium case

Morgan sets the case on the bed opens it to reveal a SEMI-
AUTOMATIC PISTOL in form-fitting velvet The thing is sleek
compact nickel-plated and in mint condition Something a
James Bond fanatic might set in a display case

MORGAN
Call the security company

NAOMI
No Im calling the police

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Morgan eases along the wall bare feet moving soundlessly
INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

A shadowy domestic landscape Only the radiance of the city
lights below Morgans eyes examine the shapes of the

furniture Nothing out of place

He comes beneath a staircase leading up to the turret office
From there he surveys the wet bar

Morgan can see the security panel Just a safe steady GREEN
LIGHT No blinking warnings

He spies a glint of RED LIGHT reflected off the staircase
railing The BEEPING SOUND comes from there Someone is in
the rec room downstairs Morgan advances with the gun held
out front

INT STAIRCASEREC ROOM - NIGHT

Morgan crouches on the steel stairs His eyes search the
room below Exercise equipment is spread out A treadmill
exercise bike bench press dumbbell rack etc

A RED LASER LIGHT BEAM reflects off the wall of mirrors It
is being emitted from something in the hands of the

INTRUDER

The man has a dark hood over his head and a utility belt of
some sort Morgan can make out the shape of a PISTOL GRIP in
the belt He is kneeling by the wall with the replaced
mirror tiles

Morgan stretches his gun between the railing bars and aims
down The intruder senses him He spins around and rises
from the floor

BLAM-BLAM

Morgan double-taps the trigger Mirror tiles CRACK The
intruder leaps aside and reaches for his gun

Morgan descends two more steps gets a better angle over the
railing and FIRES AGAIN

The man in black is blown backwards He topples over the
treadmill and goes still Face down on the floor

Morgan hears the SNAP (0S) of a pistol slide being released
behind him Another armed intruder is above him

Morgan freezes The faint sound of VEHICLE SIRENS (0S)
waft up from the canyon

POUNDING FOOTSTEPS (0S) from above Morgan turns around
The second intruder has fled A moment later the front door
upstairs crashes open with a THUD (0S) and that shrieking
ALARM (0S) pierces the house

MORGAN
Naomi

Morgan runs up the stairs
EXT HILLTOP HOME - NIGHT

Three police vehicles and an ambulance crowd the circular
driveway Their LIGHTS spin silently

INT RECREATION ROOM - NIGHT

Two UNIFORMED POLICE and a MEDIC keep a perimeter around the
first intruders body Morgan stands at the back wall with
DETECTIVE WARRELL KAYE (late 40s) in a somber suit

Det Kaye finishes taking a statement from Morgan He flips
his notebook closed and approaches the body

Morgan is ashen He looks up at the top of the staircase
where Naomi in burgundy slippers and matching robe waits
with DETECTIVE BURGESS (late 30s) Kayes junior partner

The uniforms step aside as Kaye kneels down by the intruder
He slips on a pair of latex gloves and examines the
intruders utility belt Soft velcro pouches contain
specialized TOOLS A professional burglar

Kaye gently pulls the hood back from the intruders head A
flattened crew-cut underneath Salt-n-pepper gray The man
has a dark Hispanic complexion

Naomi GASPS from the top of the stairs

NAOMI
He was at the auction

JT (0S)
Guess one of Nolans friends
decided to drop by

Everyone is surprised to find JT standing in the sliding
glass doorway to the pool deck

DET KAYE
Who the hell are you

The uniforms are ready to pounce

JT
JT Crosby Olympus Security This
house is on my patrol

DET KAYE
This is a crime scene Mr Crosby

JT
Understood You guys have cleanup
duty Ill wait upstairs

JT gives Morgan a look then swaggers back outside One of
the cops follows him

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The strobing POLICE LIGHTS penetrate the home easily through
the wide front windows Det Kaye examines the security
keypad behind the wet bar The Fischers watch from a
respectful distance JT is itching to jump in but Det
Burgess keeps him back

DET KAYE
System only shows one breach
when the second guy ran out the
front door
(beat)
There was no breach prior to that

Naomi stares at Morgan Their skin is crawling

MORGAN
Thats not possible How did they
get in

NAOMI

Maybe they knew the code

oT
You just changed your code
Besides any commands would be
recorded in there

DET KAYE
They must have come in before you
armed the house

They all ponder the implications The Fischers are even more
disturbed than before

DET KAYE
Ill put you on a black and white
patrol route

oT
And Ill keep a unit out front for
the next forty-eight hours We
want you guys protected

This is JTs territory and hes protective of it Det Kaye
holds Morgans pistol in an evidence bag

DET KAYE
Well need this for the routine
ballistics Sounds like you have
nothing to worry about

MORGAN
Thank you

DET KAYE
I may need you to come by the
station for some follow-up

MORGAN
Are you going to find out who the
corpse is

DET KAYE
I wouldnt be doing my job if I
didnt

JT
Like I said detective he looked

familiar but I dont have a name
Det Kaye is growing weary of JT He checks his watch

DET KAYE
Why dont we let them get some
sleep

Naomi looks puzzled by this comment Shes wired awake
Morgan puts an arm around her as the professionals leave

Then he goes to the security keypad to arm the house The
sky is already starting to BRIGHTEN outside

NAOMI
You did what you had to do

MORGAN
Thats right

They are both troubled by the episode

NAOMI
You could have been killed We
could have been killed

Morgan nods soberly as he examines the security keypad The
mystery is eating at him

EXT HILLTOP HOME - DAY

Another sunny smoggy day in the Hollywood Hills An Olympus
patrol vehicle is parked across the street The garage door
rises revealing Morgans SUV and Naomis less ostentatious
sedan A full car space lies between them

Morgan comes out from the garage spots the patrol car JT
strolls over

oT
Whered you learn to shoot

MORGAN
My stepfather was a Riverside
Sheriff

JT
(nodding)
My pop was a Georgia state trooper
Kid brothers LAPD

Morgan studies him Explains a lot JT surveys the exterior
of the house

JT
Having some cameras would be an
excellent deterrent

MORGAN
How did those guys get in my house

JT
Youd have to ask them Im just
thinking ahead
EXT MORGANS STREET - DAY
Mid-afternoon now A white utility van is parked around a
curve just down the street from Morgans place Someone
with a sweatshirt hood and binoculars is behind the wheel

INT VAN - DAY - BINOCULAR POV

A POLICE CRUISER creeps past Morgans property As the car
rolls away the unseen WATCHER speaks into a cell phone

WATCHER (0S)
Aurelio Black and whites on
drive-by circuit

AURELIO (VO)

(through phone)
Only a matter of time before they
link Capilla to us

The voice of AURELIO is that of a serpent smooth and
unhurried Almost a whisper An aristocrat who has almost
masked his foreign accent He could be Mediterranean
Latin American

WATCHER (0S)
Then theres the fucking security
guard Hes putting up cameras

The watchers binocular POV moves over to the property

eaves of Morgans house

WATCHER (0S)

EXT MORGANS STREET - DAY
The van backs up and turns around Rolls away
INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Morgan is behind the bar looking much more composed Naomi
sits on a stool drinking a glass of wine She still seems
rattled

Morgan is operating what appears to be a tiny computer
station set on the bar counter A small black and white
monitor with a compact keyboard

MORGAN
You can toggle between cameras
(then)
Or you can run a thirty second
playback of all cameras
simultaneously

Morgan presses a few keys Finally he masters it Various
EXTERIOR SHOTS of the house appear on the monitor

NAOMI
This was all JTs idea

MORGAN
Hes not a bad guy I wouldnt
invite him to dinner

Naomi laughs

NAOMI

Morgan takes a sip from his martini glass
INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

Naomi lies in bed watching Morgan hammer in the second of
two picture hangers He lifts a large framed painting
struggles to catch the back wire on both hooks

NAOMI
If the book doesnt break as big as
we hope youll be okay with that

MORGAN
Well manage I1l pay the bills

Not the kind of support shes looking for Morgan adjusts
the painting steps back It is crooked

NAOMI
I wish I knew what the critics are
writing about me

MORGAN
Does that look straight That
isnt straight I cant do this

Morgan takes the picture down studies his hooks They are
sadly misaligned Naomi is staring at him waiting for a
real response Morgan finally picks up on her need

MORGAN
People either love your kind of
book or they dont What are you
gonna do

Naomi turns away from him hurt Morgan flicks off the
lights and slides into his side of the bed The darkness
envelops them

The clock reads 1045
INT BEDROOM - DAY
The clock advances to 730 The SNOOZE RADIO activates
RADIO NEWSCASTER
- what will be the fate of
Tagaro Protestors of capital
punishment have been gathered
outside the San Quentin facility

since last night

Morgan is asleep oblivious to the radio and bright sunlight
outside He is alone in the bed

RADIO NEWSCASTER
Governor Hollenbeck is considering
a last-minute plea for a stay of
execution but sources say such a
decision is highly unlikely
From somewhere deep within the house NAOMI SCREAMS

Morgan bolts upright He shakes off sleep Was he dreaming
He slaps the snooze button silencing the radio

MORGAN
Naomi

Morgan slips out of bed The master bath door is open No
one in there

Morgan moves quickly down the hall

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY

Morgan scans the empty rooms He runs up the stairs

Naomis office is coming together Large writing desk

Bookshelves crammed with texts But her ergonomic writing
chair is vacant Morgan goes to the window looks down on

INT RECREATION ROOM - DAY

Morgan winds down the steps to the floor No sign of Naomi
He seems to dread this room now He scans the pool patio
outside Not a soul

INT GUEST BATHROOM - DAY

Morgan enters and stares in shock at the center of the tiled
bathroom floor

A TRAP DOOR PANEL IS HANGING OPEN

Built right into the tiling

Morgan gazes with growing dread at the shaft that descends
through the floor Rungs are set in the wall leading
straight down ten feet

Morgan peers down He can make out the dim form of a SLIPPER
lying in the horizontal passageway below

MORGAN
NAOMI

NAOMI (0S)
(faintly)
Morgan

Morgan clambers down the hatch No time to think

INT SEWER - DAY

Morgan drops into the cramped tunnel which could be nothing
other than a sewer tunnel Only two ways to go from here --

up the twisting pipe beyond the escape hatch or down

Naomis far-echoed SCREAM (0S) settles it Morgan races
down the damp tunnel following the curve down the canyon

DIM SQUARE BULBS behind safety cages light portions of the
tunnel every several yards Like sporadic streetlights on
the most claustrophobic street

Morgan runs barefoot through the slop hands skimming the
concrete walls for balance Morgan sees DAYLIGHT ahead

The end of the tunnel is a rusted metal grate Morgan can
see a soggy culvert outside surrounded by underbrush and
steep hillside

A WHITE VAN is pulling away

EXT DRAINAGE CULVERT - DAY

Morgan pushes against the grate which rises out on a hinge
He races toward the van as it rolls up the hill to the canyon

road above

MORGAN
HEY

A FIGURE rushes up behind Morgan A GUNMAN in a dark blue
sweat suit hood over his head dark sunglasses and a bandana
pulled over his mouth

He swings the silencer barrel of his MAC-10 sub-machine
gun SLAMMING Morgan upside the head

Morgan topples falls in the tall grass He is dazed
MORGANS POV

The world swirls in a drunken spin The canyon walls
surround him Luxury homes on stilts way up there

teetering

The WHOOSHING sounds (0S) of CARS up on the canyon road

The wide black sunglasses of the hooded gunman whipping
Morgan around

The mouth of the tunnel yawning open to swallow Morgan
again

INT SEWER - DAY

Morgan collapses in the tunnel Wet muck soils his shirt
The gunman kicks him forcing him back up His compact black
sub-machine gun is leveled slung on a strap Morgan is
slowly coming back to himself

MORGAN
(scared shitless)
What what do you want

The gunman snaps the safety off his weapon

MORGAN
Where are they taking her

GUNMAN
You find out at the house

INT GUEST BATHROOM - DAY

Morgan emerges through the trap door He climbs out
breathing heavily ear bloodied He is still clutching
Naomis slipper in one hand The world is still surreal

The gunman rises halfway up gestures with his gun barrel

Morgan sees the CELL PHONE sitting on the bench It isnt
his It BLINKS and VIBRATES with an incoming call Morgan
crawls to it answers

MORGAN
Who is this

Morgan stares at the gunman while speaking into the phone
He tries to sound tough and in control The response comes
clearly in speakerphone mode

AURELIO (VO)
Mr Fischer My people have your
wife

That serpent hiss again It freezes Morgans blood This
caller is in control NOT Morgan

MORGAN
Who are you

AURELIO (VO)
Aurelio That will suffice

(NOTE The phone conversations between these two are always
in speakerphone mode )

MORGAN
We dont have any real money We
sunk it all in this house

His voice cracks The tough guy facade is breaking down

AURELIO (VO)
This is not a kidnapping for
ransom
(beat)
You have work to do Mr Fischer

MORGAN
What are you talking about

AURELIO (VO)
Nolan Rego stole millions from my
employer We want it back

MORGAN
What the hell does that have to do
with us

AURELIO (VO)
Nolan built a vault in that house

MORGAN
A vault

AURELIO (VO)
A safe I sent my best men in to
find it We had no intention of
involving you but then you
killed my point man and brought on
this police scrutiny

Morgan peers out at the recreation room The site of his
fatal mistake

AURELIO (VO)
I would like to go in and tear
apart your home to find this cache
but Im afraid that is too much of
a risk
(beat)
Youll have to do it

Morgan spins around in shock The gunman has pulled up his
sweatshirt revealing a tool belt much like the one the
intruder wore the other night He unstraps the belt sets it
down Peeking through the flaps and sleeves are hammers
short saws and a compact power drill

MORGAN
I just moved in here I dont know
this house I dont know anything
about construction or finding safes
or tools

AURELIO (VO)
I know they are watching That
house has to look normal
(then)
You own it You live there
Youre the one behind the windows
You have to be the one

Morgans mind is racing Every word from Aurelio is
critical He clutches the phone with white knuckles and
looks out the glass windows at his pool deck

AURELIO (VO)
You will locate the safe by five
oclock

MORGAN
Today

AURELIO (VO)
This is the deadline for my
employer

MORGAN
And if I cant find it

AURELIO (VO)
You will not see Naomi again

Morgan bristles Aurelio does have her He knows her name

MORGAN
How can you be sure the safe is
still here The police already
tore stuff out

Morgan is looking back at the mirrored wall
AURELIO (VO)

They didnt find the trap door to
the escape tunnel did they

Morgan stammers

AURELIO (VO)

They didnt find the safe either
(then)

Here are the conditions You will
search for the safe You will keep
this phone for communication with
me only I will be checking on
you as will my colleague

Morgan turns back to the guest bathroom surprised to find
that the gunman has vanished The trap door has disappeared
Nothing but a perfect seamless expanse of tile

AURELIO (VO)
You will not leave the house You
will not notify the security patrol
or the police You will not
discuss this with anyone

(beat)

Someone comes to the door you make
them go away I see one person
inside that house that isnt Morgan
Fischer your wife dies

MORGAN
So you can see me

TELESCOPE POV

The hillside estate is in center focus A tiny Morgan stands
by the window looking out at his swimming pool Dwarfed by
his giant house Aurelio is already watching from afar

AURELIO (0S)
Everyone can see you We will be
monitoring your movements To keep
you honest I require that you go
outside on the upper terrace every
hour on the hour for two minutes

EXT POOL PATIO - DAY

Morgan comes outside with the phone staring out at the city
as if trying to gauge from where Aurelio is watching

AURELIO (VO)
Then I can see that you are
diligently working

Morgan grips the railing on his terrace to steady himself
The unreality of it all has undermined his sense of balance

MORGAN
If you hurt her in any way

AURELIO (VO)
Do you understand these conditions

MORGAN
(through clenched teeth)
I find your safe I get her back
(off the silence)
Right I get her back

CLICK Morgan hears a chilling DIAL TONE (0S)

Morgan releases his grip of the railing In doing so he
leaves the crushed slipper sitting there like a sacrifice on
an altar

He turns dazed and looks at his new dream home
His castle His prison
INT GUEST BATHROOM - DAY

Morgan splashes water on his face his bloody ear He is
trembling It takes tremendous effort for him to raise his
head and look at himself in the mirror

MORGAN
(sotto)
You can do this

Morgan starts by studying the one known eccentricity of the
house -- the trap door Only the expert eye can make out the
spider cracks between the grouting and the four central tiles
of the door

Morgan feels around the edges of tile pressing on the gray
grouting until a strip of it rises up on a spring A thin
handle like a moving part of a giant Swiss Army knife

Morgan pulls up on the handle and the door rises from the
floor but stops after exposing two inches of darkness

Morgan kneels down and tries to see in the crack Strands of
rope have been knotted around the inner handle probably tied
around the rungs The door is anchored down

Morgan reaches for a small-tooth saw from the tool belt
Then he drops it

MORGAN
(sotto)
Idiot Thats how theyll know

If the rope has been cut when the gunman returns Morgan is
busted

Morgan drops the door The handle folds back neatly into the
floor Morgan tosses the saw and paws through the other
tools He studies a strange black plastic device the size
of a large walkie-talkie But it isnt one Puzzled Morgan
sets it aside

He picks up a nail hammer He taps the tile of the trap
door listens to the deep THUNK

Then he taps other tiles surrounding the hatch Flat sounds
Solid concrete beneath them

LATER

Several of the tiles have been smashed -- some in the walls
Gouged out like hollow eye sockets

INT RECREATION ROOM - DAY

Morgan is on his hands and knees methodically tapping the 12-
inch tiles in sequence There are a few hundred of them in
this room alone

SUPER 840 AM

Then Morgan looks up fixes his sights on the mirrored wall
He clambers over to the area with the replaced mirror tiles
Where he shot the intruder

Morgan SMASHES IN the mirrors with the hammer He uses the
hammer claw to hack through the drywall exposing a pocket
within

But it is merely a hollow alcove between the house and the
hillside of dirt and rock Nothing in there Morgan
stretches his back Hes discouraged

INT TURRET OFFICE - DAY

Morgan has closed the blinds to every window He slips a
pair of binoculars through the slats and studies the realm
beyond his back patio

BINOCULAR POV

Across the canyon to the left are HOMES ON STILTS

A RICH WOMAN sunbathes on one deck while talking on her
cordless phone

A GARDENER with headphones trims bushes at another property

MORGAN (0S)
(sotto)
Aurelio That you

POV shifts up to a hilltop marked with zigzag hiking
trails Two JOGGERS stand at the summit staring vaguely his
direction But all they have are water bottles

POV shifts down to the right

The modern office buildings and 1920s era hotels rise from
the Hollywood streets POV shifts from a WINDOW WASHER on a
rig to a MAINTENANCE MAN on a hotel roof wiping the
scaffolding of a rooftop billboard

There are so many buildings so many windows So many
suspects

POV shifts down the hillside beyond the glimpse of road
to the lower drainage culvert We can barely make out the
BLUE HOOD of the gunman stationed below the road Guarding
the escape tunnel

MORGAN

Lowers the binoculars Hes boxed in

INT KITCHEN - DAY

The sub-zero refrigerator has been rolled away from its nook
Morgan is trying to unscrew the overhead microwave from its

mounting frame

Dishes and glasses are all over the counters The cupboards
are empty and wide open The hunt is on

Morgan is stripping the screws He GRUNTS and jabs at the
microwave with the screwdriver

MORGAN
Where the fuck are you

Morgan opens a few lower cabinets examines the back walls
He yanks an empty drawer out tosses it

A pair of SWIMMING GOGGLES flies out The rubber strap snags
a cabinet knob Morgan stares at the goggles

He yanks out the next drawer dumps it Amidst the junk --
napkins candles matchsticks -- he sees a CIGARETTE PACK
Secret stash

Morgan lunges for it shakes out a smoke He grips a blue-
tipped match strikes it on the floor lights up He inhales
deeply as he runs a hand through his hair

A MELODY (0S) chirps from the next room Like electronic
bagpipes Morgan jumps in surprise He runs out to the
dining room grabs his personal cell phone

INT DINING ROOM - SAME

Morgan takes a moment to gather his thoughts Play it cool

MORGAN

cracks between the clay bricks always searching

MORGAN

Oh God
NAOMI (VO)

(calling out)

Wait
BEEP The message is over
Morgan stares at the phone base one hand covering his mouth
A SERIES OF SHOTS
Increasing in tempo as Morgans panic RISES
-- Morgan lights another cigarette finds his resolve

-- Morgan shifts furniture examining the walls behind

-- He flings pictures and mirrors off the walls runs his
fingers along the naked painted surfaces

-- He invades closets tossing clothes and luggage aside
searching all obvious places

-- With the power drill he unscrews air duct vents yanks
them out reaches inside the ducts

-- Morgan inspects the walls and floor of the garage checks
behind and under the furnace

-- Morgan pounds the kitchen floor tiles with a hammer
THUNK a hollow space
INT KITCHEN - DAY
Morgan uses the hammer claw to pry up two of the thick
Mexican tiles A plywood sheet lies beneath Morgan hacks
at more of the tiles until he finds an edge of the plywood
MOMENTS LATER
Morgan pries up the plywood sheet a 1 x 3 strip nailed to
the floor studs A hollow space lies below several inches
deep Completely empty
Morgan flings the plywood away in rage
INT LIVING ROOM - DAY
Morgan is hunched over the wet bar He stares at his
personal cell directory weighing his options Finally he
selects a name and dials He closes his eyes and lights a
fresh cigarette
CUT TO
A GRIMY BEIGE ANSWERING MACHINE PHONE
RINGING the same bleary warble it has rung for twenty years
It hangs on a wall covered by peeling green wallpaper A
gruff MALE VOICE answers on the machine

your pertinent details
MORGAN (VO)
(through machine)

Uh Dale You there
WE ARE
INT HAWKINS KITCHEN - DAY
A small tired place that has not seen a womans touch in a
few years Security bars frame the one small window to the

outside -- an outside that doesnt promise to be much more
inspiring judging by the grafitti-tagged bus that groans by

MORGAN (VO)
Its Morgan I know Im the last
person youd expect to be calling

DALE HAWKINS sits at the table staring at the phone on the
wall Despite his advanced age and wrinkles Dale carries
himself with a straight back His gray hair is receding but
close-cropped and presentable He wears pressed khakis and a
crisp button-down short-sleeve

This guy has not been a civilian in a long while And hes
in no hurry to talk to Morgan

BACK TO MORGAN
Leaving his awkward stilted message perhaps in vain

MORGAN
I got a bit of trouble here We
bought a new house
(doesnt know where to
begin)
I need some advice

BACK TO DALE
The ice is melting a bit Hes listening
WE INTERCUT AS NECESSARY
MORGAN
(pained)
When my mom passed on I wasnt
myself I was wrong to blame

BREEP Morgan is distracted The house phone is ringing
again Morgan rushes for the kitchen

At the same moment Dale rises from his chair reaches for
his phone

DALE

A veiled invitation Morgan still isnt sure how to
interpret him Hes at a loss

DET KAYE (VO)

MORGAN
Yes Bye

Morgan hangs up He almost blew it He takes a deep drag
from his smoke He looks at the wreck hes made of his
kitchen the wreck his life has become

INT TURRET OFFICE - DAY

Morgan is at Naomis desk fumbling with her delicate
notebook computer Hes frantically trying to use the tiny
finger pad to scroll through a WEBSITE that features various
types of SAFES

Morgan scrolls down through photos and large headings

WALL SAFES -- FLOOR SAFES -- GUN SAFES -- DROP SAFES --

As many styles shapes and sizes as one could imagine This
isnt helping

MORGAN
(sotto)
I need you Bruce

Morgan switches to an e-mail program and starts typing a
rapid-fire message Then he looks up at the wall clock
facing him 1000

MORGAN
Shit

He clicks SEND and the e-mail is gone He closes the
laptop screen and races out of the room

EXT UPPER TERRACE - DAY

Morgan paces along the deck with his cigarette making his
presence known to Aurelio He checks his watch He looks at
Aurelios cell phone in his hand as it glows and VIBRATES

He answers

looks at the display screen He moves inside to get out of
the glare
INT LIVING ROOM - DAY

Morgan accepts the video transfer on the cell He waits as
the file downloads The video file OPENS

INSERT - PHONE DISPLAY

Dim lighting shows a CAGE -- something a kennel would keep a
large dog in Something is moving in there

A SPOTLIGHT shows us NAOMI still in her bathrobe A
blindfold covers her eyes Her arms are tied behind her
back She writhes in discomfort

MORGAN

Stares in horror He curls over dry heaves

INT TURRET OFFICE - DAY

Morgan digs through a file drawer He pulls out a clipped
bundle of REAL ESTATE PAPERWORK He tears through the pages
until he finds what he needs -- a rough FLOOR PLAN of house
from the home inspector

Not a blueprint -- a general diagram Three sections appear
on the page one for each level of the house Morgan studies
the diagram He grabs a marker from the desk

INSERT - FLOOR PLAN

As Morgan draws large X marks over the guest bathroom
recreation room and kitchen Conquered territory

MORGAN
Folds the diagram stuffs it in his pocket He looks at the

plush new carpet under his feet He swivels the desk chair
out of the room pushes it right down the stairs

Next he leans a low shoulder to the desk and nudges it toward
the center of the room Hes cleared the perimeter edges of
the carpet

MORGAN
(sotto)
New carpet eh

Morgan sinks to his knees at the corner by the door and tugs
at the carpet with his bare fingers He claws the corner up
and wraps his fingers around the lip

RIP Morgan yanks the corner flap of rug up from the floor
but drops it just as quickly He clamps a hand over his
injured finger

MORGAN
Shit

Morgan releases his hand to see that his middle FINGERNAIL
has come off Blood trickles down

INT GARAGE - DAY

Morgan has the tool belt strapped on He rummages through
the moving boxes finds some larger tools of his own

A rusty shovel rake and AXE Morgan reaches for the axe
INT TURRET OFFICE - DAY

Morgan now has a pair of pliers He rips up half the
carpeting and flops it over the desk The original wood
flooring lies below Morgan kneels down and feels the boards

with his fingertips

MORGAN
Forget this

He steps toward the stairway and fetches the axe Morgan
raises it over his head and glares at the floor with fury
He swings it down with a THUNK

Morgan kicks at the axe head breaking up the floor He
swings it down again Splinters fly

LATER

The perimeter flooring has been gouged out Chunks of wood
are strewn everywhere No sign of the prize however
44

Morgan leans in the doorway sweaty and exhausted His hands
are blistered and bloody He unfolds the diagram draws an
X through the turret office

Morgan looks into one of the open FILE BOXES he has tossed
around during his search Framed and loose PHOTOGRAPHS
hastily packed from their move He pulls one out

INT STAIRCASELIVING ROOM - DAY

Morgan sags down the stairs staring at the dusty frame

Morgan hangs up He cautiously approaches the door peers
out the window He cant see anyone

Morgan jerks as a BUZZING SOUND comes from his pocket He
pulls out Aurelios phone answers

AURELIO (VO)

Morgan reacts thinks quickly

MORGAN

CLICK Aurelio has disconnected
INT LIVING ROOM - DAY

Morgan is sweating like a madman chopping at the hardwood
floors like he did upstairs

Hes torn up three random pockets Hollow spaces lie below
stuffed with pink insulation that has been torn up This
floor is directly over the ceiling of the rec room

The workout is taking its toll Morgan fights to pull the
axe blade free from an especially deep dig

A hard KNOCKING SOUND (0S) alerts him again Morgan turns
to see JT knocking on the narrow window framing the door

He cannot allow him inside But Morgan has no choice He
approaches opens the door

JT
Morning Wanted to check in

EXT HILLTOP HOME - SAME

JT squints to see past Morgan He notes the axe embedded in
the floor

JT
Jesus Christ

MORGAN
Were re-doing the floors

JT looks at him like hes gone mad

MORGAN
I thought I could save money by
doing the tear-out myself

Morgan jabbers quickly like a con-man on the run

JT
Does the misses know about this

The alarm is clear in JTs eyes but hes not letting it show
in his voice Morgan tries a disarming smile He closes the
door behind him and lights another cigarette Hoping the
smoke will push this guy back

MORGAN
Its her idea We got in a little
argument about it

JT
And you got passive aggressive on
the furnishings

Morgan nods blows smoke JT pretends to buy the story

JT
Whered she go Run off

MORGAN
(quickly)
Yeah Itll work itself out

JT
Weve had a unit outside Didnt
see her leave

Morgan walked into that one He notes the SECURITY GUARD
behind the wheel of a second patrol car across the street
one house over Close enough to see Morgans house yet not
close enough to see INSIDE the house

MORGAN
She didnt take her car A friend
picked her up down the street

oT
My guy must have missed that

JT smiles at Morgan who is quivering
They watch as a sporty BMW slows on the street It pulls

into the circular drive and stops by the front door Morgan
stiffens

The window rolls down Evan the editor is behind the
wheel Morgan moves quickly to contain the situation

EVAN
How is she

MORGAN
Sleeping

Evan keeps the motor running Morgan is getting antsy
shifting on his feet

EVAN
Can you give her a message

Morgan jerks He slips Aurelios cell from his pocket It
vibrated just once

EVAN
Tell her the publisher will send a
rep to the signing tomorrow

Morgan nods but hes not listening Hes looking at the
display on the phone A text message

Morgan folds the phone away Evan is looking at JT

EVAN
Everything okay

MORGAN
Theyre upgrading our security
system

EVAN
I heard about the break-in Take

Evan drives off JT saunters closer an accusing look on his
face He overheard caught Morgan in a lie

MORGAN

JT (CONTD)

protect my residents on the hill
From all enemies High profile
people deserve a safe haven

(slippery smile)
Think of me as a buffer between you
and the world Im here for you
Just let me know how I can help

Morgan gets his meanings He watches JT leave Morgan looks
beaten and disgusted

EXT UPPER TERRACE - DAY
Morgan paces on the terrace waiting out the two minutes
SUPER 1100 AM

He holds the special cell phone but it doesnt ring or
vibrate No further communiques

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY

With renewed fervor Morgan tries to pry the axe blade from
the floor He swivels his body prying the submerged axe
like an oar

He slips on wood splinters falling right on the axe handle
Morgans eyes register sharp pain and surprise

He breathes in shallow spurts Carefully he rises off the
floor realizing that the back of the axe head was buried
under his arm part-way into his ribs

Blood flows freely Morgan can hardly breathe or move He
rolls over and begins the painful one-armed crawl

From somewhere comes the RING TONE (0S) of Morgans
personal cell phone Morgan stares at the phone on the table
as he crawls across the floor

MORGAN
(growing delirious)
Kinda busy here

INT MASTER BATHROOM - DAY
Morgan is in the shower arm raised to allow the water to
cleanse his side He can see the laceration is serious

enough for stitches but not life-threatening

By his shallow breathing we can assume he has at least
bruised a few ribs

LATER

Morgan stands in front of the medicine cabinet mirror An
Ace bandage is wrapped around his torso Temporary field
dressing He keeps his arm tight to his wounded side

Morgan opens the cabinet wrestles with the safety cap on a
Tylenol bottle He shakes several capsules straight into his
mouth and dry swallows

Morgan closes the mirror door and stares at his wet face
Hes losing this battle

He lifts the hammer with his good hand and SMASHES the mirror
in Then he smashes the cabinet until it falls off its
screws It leaves a discolored square in the wall behind

The original paint hue -- not the kind of square Morgan is
looking for

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY

Morgan now wears jeans and a loose shirt He finally pries
the axe out of the floor He moves his weak arm too much
feels the stab from his sore ribs He rests the axe against
the fireplace

Hes too weak for this And that frightens him
INT MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

Morgan sits on the bed with his cell phone The doors are
closed The curtains are drawn He has a pad of paper and
pen at the ready Like a warm-call salesman he goes through
a SERIES of quick conversations

MORGAN

(into phone)
Of course the investment would be
half yours I just need the
capital up-front

(listens)
Yeah the down payment tapped us
out but we cant ignore this kind
of opportunity

desperate enough to try

Morgan turns ready to hurl the phone

But he cant do that Instead he kicks an empty clay pot
across the terrace It SHATTERS against the railing

ALEDAS SONG
By Naomi Fischer

Morgan lifts several of the rubber-banded drafts Admiring
the effort Naomi has put in

Morgan spots the Olympus security guard running from his car

The guard runs toward the front of the house Morgan cant
see his front entry from up here

MORGAN
What the hell

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY

Morgan moves as quickly as he can given his injury Someone
is POUNDING on the front door As Morgan moves for the
foyer he hears GLASS BREAKING (0S)

Morgan approaches the door as a HAND reaches through the
narrow window pane and unlocks the door

Morgan freezes The door flies open

A TATTOOED SKINHEAD fills the frame white t-shirt flecked
with blood He has a large combat knife in one hand the
kind with brass knuckles built into the grip

Morgan is stunned as the muscle-bound young thug storms
toward him Behind him in the courtyard lies the body of the
security guard Blood spills from his neck

SKINHEAD
Where is it

MORGAN
(backing away)
What

SKINHEAD
You think Im playing I know its
here

The knifefist comes flying smacking Morgan between the
eyes sending him sprawling

Morgan winces as he hits the floor His ribs are on fire
The skinhead grabs his hair from behind lifts his head

The blade is held at the back of his neck pressing into
Morgans spine

SKINHEAD
The safe asshole Now

MORGAN
You dont understand Im already
working with Aurelio

The skinhead lifts Morgan by the arms squeezes his
shoulderblades together Morgan SCREAMS in agony

SKINHEAD
You think I give a shit about
Aurelio and his vatos

He pushes Morgan at the fireplace Morgan slams it hard
clings to the bricks for balance

SKINHEAD
In case you havent figured it out
I dont play for their team

The skinhead admires the play of light on his blade He
holds it closer to Morgan

SKINHEAD
I just spent some hard time with
the guy that lived here

(then)
He promised me fifty grand to watch
his back

MORGAN
You did a good job of that

The skinhead is surprised by his audacity

He

SKINHEAD
What did you say

The knife tip is now just inches from Morgans eye

MORGAN
You want the safe

Morgans head dips to the spiral stairs The skinhead points
his knife Morgan grips the railing and hobbles down

INT RECREATION ROOM - DAY

Morgan gestures to the hole he has smashed low in the
mirrored wall

The skinhead kneels by the wall He dusts broken shards of
mirrored glass away so that he can place both hands on the
floor to peer inside the hollow

Morgan snatches a 10-pound DUMBBELL from the rack and lunges
at the floor He SLAMS the weight on the skinheads knife
hand crushing it

The skinhead GASPS
Morgan swings the flat side of the dumbbell up into the mans
face His nose explodes as he falls backwards Morgans got

his own brass knuckles

Morgan stands above the writhing man whose one functional
hand is pressed to the fountain of blood in his face

Morgan SCREAMS with primal fury and raises the dumbbell over
his head

The skinhead holds his arm up in surrender Morgan trembles
with rage ready to crush this guys skull

MORGAN

WHITTT

A funny sound A HOLE bleeds out from the skinheads face
above his eye He twitches dead

Morgan spins around to behold
THE GUNMAN

Standing right behind him with his silenced MAC-10 The trap
door is open in the bathroom beyond

Morgan reacts on instinct -- almost clobbers the GUNMAN with
the weight instead

But that dark barrel is aimed at his chest Silent and
nasty Morgan drops the dumbbell to the broken tiles

GUNMAN

He watches numbly as the gunman drags the dead security guard
into the foyer and lays him on Naomis throw rug The
guards throat has been cut open

The gunman calmly removes the keys from the guards belt He
rolls the bundle up like a sleeping bag

GUNMAN
Bring it in the garage

He tosses the guards keys to Morgan The gunman swings his

can see the gun barrel through the front window

Then Morgan looks up shocked to see a black and white PATROL
CAR gliding toward him

lid shut

10 strap Then he pulls down the bandana and hood removes
his sunglasses Unmasking himself for the drive outside He
has an olive complexion like a Latino or East Asian Scar
under the lip

Morgan has finally made friends with the stud-finder and
laser level He passes it close to the wall and two red
LASER BEAMS are projected horizontally on the wall surface

MORGAN
(impressed)
Never hang a crooked picture again
(adjusting the device)
Lets see whats behind

The lines disappear Now as Morgan passes the device along
the wall a vertical laser line suddenly shoots out marking
the stud location An ELECTRONIC BEEP follows

This must be what the first intruder was doing that night in
the rec room

Morgan keeps moving A second line shoots out BEEP A
second wall stud As Morgan keeps going toward what should
be a third stud

A HORIZONTAL LASER LINE splays out which expands into a
SQUARE BEEP-BEEP-BEEP something solid behind here A
12x12 box is hidden behind the wall

Morgan sets the drill in the center He drills an inch deep
until he can hear the GRINDING of metal on metal

Morgan sets the tools aside and lifts a hatchet He hacks at
the drywall surrounding the drill hole

Gradually he exposes what looks like an electrical box
Morgan GASPS with anticipation This could be it

But theres no lock on this box Morgan chips away the last
bits of drywall framing the box then he pries open the door

Two rows of TELEPHONE CIRCUITS line the inside Morgan can
tell by the VERIZON logo on the door All the multi-colored
lines have been CUT except for two

He lifts the hatchet regards it like a gladiator inspecting

his weaponry Ready to give it one more go

A SERIES OF SHOTS

MASTER BEDROOM -- Turned upside-down The mattress
spring are standing against the windows The floor
to pieces

MASTER BATHROOM -- Covered in dust Chunks of tile
missing from the shower

LIVING ROOM -- Holes punched through every wall Bloody
handprints Like a bomb went off

everything back in place The shrine is intact

THE FLOOR PLAN -- Lying forgotten on the floor Every room
is an X -- and a giant X has been scrawled across the

entire page Game Over
INT RECREATION ROOM - DAY
Morgan looks through the doorway to the bathroom Hes

lifeless as a corpse His shirt is stained with dried blood
and covered with dust HE GRIPS DALES GUN IN ONE HAND

He gave it his all and he failed
He drifts forward
INT GUEST BATHROOM - DAY
Morgan lifts the trap door He stares down the hole
An escape
He slams the hatch closed No way
Morgan checks his watch He contemplates the cold 38 opens
the cylinder to see six rounds in the chambers Hes ina
crisis of conscience
MORGAN
(dazed)
God help me

He opens the hatch again stares down
The darkness is tempting
But Hell isnt
Morgan slams the door closed again

INT RECREATION ROOM - DAY

Morgan is strangely still and resolute He slips Aurelios
phone from his pocket dials the callback

AURELIO (VO)
Yes

MORGAN
Let Naomi go She has a life ahead
of her A career She has nothing
to do with any of this

Morgan climbs the steps as he lays it out

MORGAN
It was my idea to buy the house at
auction It was my ego

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY

Morgan passes through toward the kitchen but his eyes never
leave the large windows seeking out Aurelio

MORGAN
So you can take me instead You
can take this house You can do
whatever you want
(beat)
Just promise me youll let her go

INT KITCHEN - DAY

Morgan ends his walk He closes his eyes There is a long
silence His words have hit some kind of mark

AURELIO (VO)

I thought we went over this
already I release her when you
find the safe

MORGAN
What Im asking

CLICK Aurelio hangs up Morgan drops the phone He raises
the gun and randomly SHOOTS a gutted kitchen cabinet

The vibration knocks a loose shard of glass free The
dangling SWIMMING GOGGLES fall from the cabinet knob

Morgan tilts his head wondering why he didnt question these
before He lunges into the debris to retrieve the goggles
He examines them
They are clear durable of the highest quality
MORGAN
(sotto)

Where did you come from

HE HAS NEVER SEEN THEM BEFORE TODAY

Morgan places them over his eyes He studies the gun
GOGGLE POV

The gun is ENLARGED but slightly blurry

MORGAN

Tears the goggles away from his face He rushes to the side
table finds the newspaper the fax pages He paws through

them

There again is the PHOTO of Nolan Rego Dark curly hair
thick eyeglasses

Morgan feels the goggle lenses
MORGAN
(a whisper)
These are your eyes Why do you
need them

Morgan knows this is the key if only he can interpret it
He trembles with adrenaline and rushes out to the terrace

EXT POOL PATIO - DAY

Morgan paces around the pool staring at the water The
waterfall is spilling just a trickle of water into the deep
end Morgan rushes to the faux-rock waterfall base three
feet tall and several feet in diameter

He finds an ACCESS DOOR cut into the back of the faux-rock
A cheap key latch locks it shut Morgan tries to pry the
panel out

Finally he KICKS it in tears the fiberglass off its hinges
Inside the hollow base are tanks filters pumps and pipes
The pool and waterfall equipment Morgan strains to see past
this Nothing else in there

Morgan shuts off each dial he can find He reverses one
called BACKFLOW

EXT SWIMMING POOL (UNDERWATER) - DAY
BUBBLES rise from the drain
INT SEWER - DAY

Pool water begins streaming down the sewer tunnel

We RISE back up the sewer pipe up the escape hatch through
the tile floor across the bathroom out to the pool deck

EXT POOL PATIO - DAY

The waterfall has stopped spilling Morgan watches the pool
level gradually drop

MORGAN
Come on

Morgan lies down on the deck sets the revolver and goggles
aside Hes like a junkie jonesing for a fix He studies
the pool itself White plaster walls with a blue tiled rim

Under the waterfall lip halfway to the pool bottom is the
POOL LIGHT framed by a mosaic of dark blue and gray tiles
A pattern that stands out from the rest of the plain pool
walls Just decorative tiles Or

Morgan empties his pockets and jumps into the pool He sinks
below the surface

EXT SWIMMING POOL (UNDERWATER) - DAY
Morgan feels the tiling He grips the dome light cover
feels around the metal edge He gets a grip and finds that

it can turn like the lid of a jar Or a submarine hatch

Morgan twists like mad until the light cover disengages It
glides forward then swings open on a hinge

Morgans underwater eyes go wide as he sees into the abyss
behind the light fixture

A metal-plated cylinder that ends at a round SAFE DOOR

A NUMERIC KEYPAD is set in the center Much like his
security keypad upstairs The digits GLOW Morgan can read
them even without goggles He can also see the logo for
AmSec on the safe

EXT SWIMMING POOL - DAY

Morgan bursts through the surface elated He BELLOWS

MORGAN
Got you motherfucker I GOT YOU

EXT POOL PATIO - DAY

Morgan stands dripping wet on the patio He holds Aurelios
phone between his fingers

SUPER 457 PM

The sky has turned a brazen pink and orange hue as the sun
burns through the lowest level of smog Night is falling

Morgan snarls into the phone with newfound leverage

the name Naomi
BACK TO MORGAN
Listening to the cell phone
AURELIO (VO)

The line goes dead again Morgan wonders if hes being set
up for another trap

Morgan looks back at the pool His elation turns to worry
He gets one shot at this

He checks his watch takes a breath Steady Hes got time

Morgan spreads the fax from Bruce across the desk The sum
total of what he knows about Nolan Rego He composes his
thoughts It is time to fight back with his mind

He finds a phone number on the screen and dials on his
personal cell

papers streaking every word or number sequence that appears
with hyphens

dense real estate legal wording and assessor codes

He turns back to the front page Halfway down on the left is

Morgan counts them - three hyphens

MORGAN
Holy shit

EXT SWIMMING POOL - DUSK

The patio floodlights are on providing light for Morgan

The water level is much lower just below the open pool
light Morgan can stand in the deep end now He reaches his
hand into the opening

Morgans finger inputs the code His hand draws back as the
safe door SWINGS OPEN A narrow cylindrical vault lies
beyond

Morgan pulls out a BLACK RUBBER POUCH He stays under the
lip of the pool mindful that the rest of his yard is visible
by Aurelio

He unzips the sealed pouch He can see three bundles of
cash wrapped in plastic There is also a fourth item
wrapped in plastic a small cartridge case of some sort

Morgan unwraps one of the cash bundles Benjamin Franklins
He fans through them counting an approximate total Morgan
calculates in his head

MORGAN
Thirty thousand Not enough to buy
a pardon

He wraps the cash in the plastic stuffs it in the pouch

Morgan finally unwraps the cartridge case His last hope
He unseals the case to find a silver COMPUTER HARD DRIVE

Morgan carefully lifts out the thin square drive Behind it
is a file directory list A table of contents

Morgan unfolds the print The files are labelled by NAME and
DATE cross-referenced by PHONE NUMBER

NOLANS RECORDED PHONE CALLS

Morgan scans down the list until one entry jumps out at him
HOLLENBECK JAMES 06-16-01wav

Morgan folds the print

MORGAN
They got the dirt on you Governor

This is what Aurelio is after Blackmail for a Governors
clemency Morgan puts everything back in the pouch He
tucks the pouch back into the safe

He is about to close the safe door

the deck

at it solemnly

The lighter pops out and Morgan ignites his smoke He needs
it to settle his nerves He looks at his watch 600

on the incline

Standing in the headlights is Naomi free of her blindfold

In there behind the light

While Aurelio covers Morgan with his pistol Julian climbs
down the side ladder and drops into the deep end The water
is up to his knees He sloshes over to the light fixture
swings it open

After peering inside the small passage Julian nods to
Aurelio Aurelio dials his own phone

AURELIO
Send Ruben with the woman

Morgan looks through the binoculars again

RUBEN moves toward the sewer opening He appears to be
pulling Naomi by the hand They vanish into the hillside

which obscures the entrance from Morgans view

low at his side He holds his own binoculars

MORGAN

Lowers the specs Julian climbs up the pool ladder and
begins pulling specialized tools from his duffel Drill
bits power saws

MORGAN
I know youre in a hurry I can
save you some time and trouble

Julian scowls at Morgan

MORGAN
I have the code

Aurelio scoffs

AURELIO
You know the code to Nolans safe

at Morgan

Julian takes position beside Aurelio near the dry waterfall

Morgan reaches in and enters the code They can all hear the
CLICK as the lock releases

Morgan reaches his arm into the safe He draws out the
zipper pouch Aurelio reaches down for it Morgan carefully
passes it up

He points the gun barrel at them

Morgan throws the van into drive and PUNCHES THE GAS

Morgan helps Naomi hike up the brush hillside They can hear
CARS (0OS) zipping through the canyon And distant SIRENS
(OS) The outside world is almost within reach

Morgan turns as Naomi suddenly falls The shock of the
bullet wound is hitting her She still grips her shoulder
CRIMSON BLOOD streams out between her fingers

Morgan turns sees Aurelio kneeling by the van steadying his
aim But he doesnt fire

Something is wrong Aurelio ejects the clip furious He
yanks open the slide door of his van reaches in

Morgan has no weapons He ROARS with animal rage and pushes
off the hill runs full-speed at the van

Aurelio comes back with a fresh clip Morgan dives right at
him

Their bodies slam into the van They collapse in a heap but
Aurelio recovers faster He reaches for the fallen gun

Morgan

Morgan lies there hand bracing his injured ribs Aurelio
has the gun now but hes lost the clip He KICKS at
Morgan instead

Suddenly hes pulled off balance as Naomi tackles him
But he twists and flings her aside like a child

Morgan is back up diving low for Aurelio He charges him
squarely and they crash into the soggy concrete culvert
Morgan lands a blow to Aurelios side near the bullet wound

AURELIO

You dont know who I am

As the pool water continues to gurgle through the channel
Morgan grips Aurelio by the neck

Naomi climbs into the van rummaging

Morgan forces Aurelios head into the water The TAILLIGHTS
of the van bathe everything in crimson

AURELIO
(strained)
Youll never get away My people
are everywhere

Morgan presses that head under the water with all his power
His emotions spill out in waves across his face Aurelios
eyes leer at him from under the surface

Echoes of Nolan Regos uncharitable demise

But Aurelios face rises back out by sheer force of will

SLAM

Suddenly the face is broken bleeding Naomi towers over
both men a CROWBAR in her good hand

NAOMI
Die you asshole

She spins the crowbar around and drives the sharp end RIGHT
THROUGH AURELIOS SKULL

Morgan pulls something out The rubber pouch he must have
taken from Aurelios body Naomi looks at it with interest

Morgan holds it out to Det Kaye

MORGAN
Something I found at my house
Doesnt belong to me

Det Kaye takes the pouch unzips it

MORGAN
I know it will go back into a
property room somewhere It would
be nice if some of the bills found
their way to the Riverside Sheriffs
Department

Det Kaye realizes the nature of the request He nods

DET KAYE
We found Dale Hawkins an hour ago
Im sorry He may have been
retired but he died in the line
of duty

Naomi looks at Morgan with tearful eyes

MORGAN
If you go back to the house down
in the wet bar theres a fridge

Help yourself to a ginger ale
Det Kaye stares at him puzzled

MORGAN
Behind it is a computer drive
Some insurance Nolan put away

DET KAYE
Mr Fischer your case just got a
bit more complicated

MORGAN

Naomi looks at Morgan She cant help but grin as fresh
tears spill down her face
