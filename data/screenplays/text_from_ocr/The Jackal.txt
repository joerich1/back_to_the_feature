from the living room and the side of his head EXPLODES

Again Valentina flinches sprayed with blood as Witherspoon
drops dead on the floor She dives into the nearby living
room FIRING her pistol toward the bullets apparent source
near the still-blaring stereo as she rolls to cover behind
the sofa gasping

Her heart leaping struggling to keep hold of herself
Valentina bites back her fear and jumps up looking around
the room for an instant and FIRING 1-2-3-4-5-5 times
SPRAYING the living room before ducking back Gown With
everything else going on the music is truly maddening xc
Quickly jumping up again she FIRES 2 quick shots into

Now as if in a nightmare the Jackals head appears above
her leaning over the top of the sofa--hes been lying there
all the time She looks up and her eyes widen He smiles

They always go for the sofa Its the
biggest thing in the room

One silenced THUD and the back of the sofa rips open She
groans and doubles up with a slug in her abdomen Quickl v
rising the Jackal kicks the gun from her hand then picks
her up and carries her to the sofa laying her out on it He
takes two of her fingers and presses them into the wound

JACKAL
Press down hard Itll slow the bleeding

Shes in excruciating pain muttering in Russian He dabs

his finger into the blood from her wound and shows it to her

JACKAL
See Its almost black Means the
bullets in your liver Youll be dead
in twenty minutes If the paingets to
be too much take your fingers away and
youll be dead in five Either‘ way

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Chest heaving and fluttering involuntarily Valentina lies
in the middle of the living room floor the PARAMEDICS
clustered around her working feverishly to keep her alive
She lifts her head slightly as Declan enters He gasps
seeing in an instant theres no hope and rushes to her

DECLAN

Valya

Declan moves back Valentina groans miserably anguished at
knowing shes about to die among strangers Declan suddenly
explodes hurling the paramedics back clearing them away

DECLAN

She nods again and for a moment time seems to stand still as
he lifts her and presses close running a hand through her
hair Then he kisses her tenderly deeply with a lovers
ardor romantic and powerful a magnificent kiss She sighs
tenderly grateful for this stolen moment of beauty Then
tears welling up in her loving eyes she breathes her last
breath into him

Declan lowers her body back down Lying there in death paie
as alabaster with the color drained from her the lividness
of her scar fades to almost nothing and we see her as she
might have looked rare sensitive--and unutterably
beautiful Closing his eyes and hanging his head Declan
begins to weep

EXT ISABELLAS HOUSE - LATER

Isabella returns making her way past cops and FBI agents to
the living room as ambulance attendants haul away the body
spotting Declan standing in a corner with Preston He has
known much grief in his life but at this moment he seems
utterly inconsolable Preston fades away as she appears at
Declans side putting her arms around him

ISABELLA
She said it was her job I said she was
a fool But if it werent for her that
would be me and my babies lying there
(pauses shakes head)
Theyre placing us into Witness
Protection They said theres too much
chance of my real identity getting cut

DECLAN
Yes thats good Im sorry Isabella

ISABELLA

Declan nods looking down at his hands Surreptitiously
Isabella pulls him over to the fireplace reaches up into
the chimney and retrieves a 14-shot Browning 9mm AUTOMATIC
PISTOL hidden there wrapped in plastic She holds it out
He looks at it ther her She looks him right in the eye

has a subway card Entering the platform he iust misses

train Meanwhile

Trying to push his way down the escalator Decl
way then leaps up on the metal separator ané
down head-first the rest of the way He jumps che cturnstil
to the platform knowing he only has moments o find the
Jackal before another train arrives A TRAIN 2xPROACHES on
the opposite track People prepare to board

Suddenly Declan sees the Jackal and draws Pre
Jackal sees him and dives into the crowd spr
the platform Declan cant get a clear shot

passes and he again starts shouting into his shone

cons gun

The Jackal LEAPS into the trains path People SCREAM
Declan cant see that the Jackal has cleared che entire
track and lands on the other side as the train rushes into
the station The Jackal hits the ground hard iatting go of
his duffel bag It strikes the THIRD RAIL ané DISINTEGRATES
in an ARC of blue electric fire The Jackal ssrings to his
feet drawing his gun and moving back up the cunnel
shielded from view by the still-passing train

On the platform all is chaos the crowd buzzing--Did you
see that old guy “Jesus poor man etc 3ut Declan
doesnt believe it andtalks into his phone zne din

drowning his words as he runs to the stairs 1
tunnels where hes immediately enveloped in ¢

INT THE TUNNELS - DAY 199

Off the platform the subway system is a worls of stygian
darkness illuminated by arcing electricity and dim lights

from distant trains and far-off platforms d from
electric shock a trains wheels--or the Jackai--at every
turn Declan moves carefully Very carefully

The Jackal comes to acrossing--several sets ci tracks at
right angles to the one he‘s on Following ‘t ew tracks

hes careful to avoid the third rail Present we see the
light of a TRAIN APPROACHING--an express goins in the
opposite direction

Declan sees the light in the distance catchinz a glimpse cf

urring him

Jackal sihouetted in it sight of the quarry
The express is coming hard only a few feet Declan

Blowing by the power is unbelievable thous S of tons of
metal racing at 80 MPH the rush of air pushins Declan off-
balance and he just avoids touching the third il A littie
shaken he waits for the train to pass then

’
oF

Spotting the LIGHTS of the next TRAIN STATION about a half-
mile up the track the Jackal moves quickly on

Declan rushes forward running hard trying to whisper into
his phone but

DECLAN
Hello hello

The tunnel is interfering with reception

Jackal hears his footsteps and moves into the narrow
partition between the tracks ducking behind a small supsort
beam ready to ambush Declan

Declan continues down the track

The Jackal makes out something in the darkness But suddenly
the LIGHTS of ANOTHER TRAIN appear illuminating both Declan
and Jackal--they see each other at the same instant

Declan hits the dirt as Jackal FIRES just missing him
Declan FIRES twice at the Jackal before the train HURTLS
by Once again a train is between them Seeing that Declan
cant follow the Jackal continues toward the distant light
of the next station at a dead run On the other side of the
rushing train Declan strains for a view of his enemy
through the gaps between cars NOT SEEING thac A THIRD TRAIN
bear down on him from behind coming fast almost on top of
him

But just then a HORN sounds and Declan looks back Realizing
theres no choice he leaps into the narrow space BETWEEN
the 2 racing trains

As if in a waking nightmare Declan stands in the barely 2-
foot corridor between these behemoths the suction ripping
the air from his lungs as hes grazed on either side ané
harrowingly buffeted about like a pinball about to be
pulled under when he drops down and hugs the ground until
both pass and he gasps out a sigh of profound relief

DECLAN
Fuck

Taking a few deep breaths he gets up resuming the chase
Running hard and gasping for each breath we see the firs-
hint of a crack in the Jackals cool--he keeps looking back
because

Declan keeps coming and coming hard determined implacabie
He either gets the Jackal now or dies trying

(CONTINCS)

The Jackal takes up a-position behind this e

Jackal is close to the access stairs to the platform

Seeing the Jackal in the dark about a 100 yards ahead
Declan stops takes aim and FIRES 1-2-34-5-4-7-8 shots

Bullets WHIZ by the Jackal--one STRIKING him in the calf He
goes down Touching his wound and seeing the blood the
Jackal cant believe his eyes He turns and FIZES at Declan

But Declan keeps coming oblivious to the bullets MISSING
him by MILLIMETERS

The Jackal scrambles up the stairs--he cant move quite as
quickly as before He steps onto the platform Seeing the
bleeding armed gunman the PASSENGERS panic SCREAMING and
fleeing in all directions The Jackal sneers--ne has nothing
but contempt for these creatures A TRANSIT PCLI

up drawing his weapon Almost casually the ¢
blowing his brains out at the same time snag¢
terrified 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL by the hair and drasging her
along

Declan hears the GUNSHOT and hurriesup the stairway to the
platform

In the middle of the platform theres a newsstand with a
seven-foot model of the Washington Monument i

crouching down behind the sobbing girl and w
off Declan as he emerges from the stairway--or
next train whichever opportunity presents its

get on the
first

Dripping with sweat and panting Declan cauticusly ascends
the stairs hearing the RUMBLE of an approaching train--the
Jackals escape is seconds away Reaching the cop Declan
rushes onto the platform about to fire when he SPOTS the
girl hostages little form trembling by the newsstand with
pistol at her temple Declan ducks behind a steal girder at
the platforms edge The train is getting closer

JACKAL
“Train coming Declan Nice of you to see
me off

Declan doesnt answer banging his cellular phon
to clear away static Jackal cant see him
girder but ‘he knows hes there

JACKAL

Declan still doesnt answer The Jackal jabs the gun muzzie
hard into the side of the girls head She screams

JACKAL
On second thought maybe Ill just pop
the noisy little whore right now
The girl lets out a wailing sob Declan peeks out at her
Declans eyes
The little girls eyes

Declan takes a deep breath

DECLAN
No dont do that
JACKAL
Then throw out your gun and come out I

promise to leave you both in peace once
the train gets here

DECLAN
Ah bugger it Here

The Jackal sees a checkmate as Declan throws out his pistol
and steps out hands up The Jackal stands moving over to
Declan pushing the girl ahead of him gun-muzzle still ac
her temple

JACKAL
Very noble your doing this to save an
innocent ‘Course Im still gonna xill
her--loose ends you know--didnt really
think I wouldnt did you

DECLAN
No but so long as there was a chance
JACKAL
Speaking of loose ends your turn comes
next
DECLAN
My turn Now wait you dont do what

you want to the rest but I just want to
go home Please Dont do this to xe

Sweat pouring off him in sheets now Declan szarts
trembling The Jackal cant believe his eyes

JACKAL
Oh no dont tell me

DECLAN
Please Ill do anything just let me go
home PLEASE

Declan sobs sinking to his knees and clasping his hands in
in front of him begging The Jackal sneers revolted

JACKAL
So when it came down to it you showed
punk Well just for that you die first

The Jackal takes the gun muzzle away from the girls head
and points it at Declan instead Suddenly dead calm

DECLAN
I knew youd do that
(shouts)
HES CLEAR NOW

And in the next instant a black SOMETHING moves out of the
turnstiles in a blur a VOICE SHRIEKING like a harpy just as
a GUNSHOT-rings out

VOICE
CA-BRON

The Jackals neck BURSTS into red mist He FIRES reflexively
as he falls hitting Declan in the shoulder while the little
girl runs to safety The Jackal looks up to see ISABELLA
bearing down on him with her Browning automatic trained on
his head cellular phone in the other hand dressed all in
funereal black fearsome and tremendous dark eves flashing
like the sword of justice

ISABELLA
Cabron

The Jackal fumbles for his gun but Declan leaps to his feet
and kicks it away from him The Jackal sits up looking at
Declan in the most utter disbelief doubting his very
senses eyes saying “A woman followed by his voice

JACKAL
This cant be happening

DECLAN
Its over Send him to hell

Declan nods coldly to Isabella She puts the Brewning to the
Jackals forehead the wrath of the Furies in her voice as

ISABELLA
Muerete

She FIRES The Jackal slumps to the floor dead She puts
the gun and phone into her coat taking off her scarf and
wrapping it around his wound hands trembling

ISABELLA
Here

He touches her hand to stop its trembling then

DECLAN
Come weve gotta get you out of here

He pulls her toward the turntiles and they both disappear up
the stairs to the street above as

DECLAN
