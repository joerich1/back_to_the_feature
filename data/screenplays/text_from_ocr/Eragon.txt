EXT DU WELDENVARDEN - FOREST - NIGHT

The trees are tall and thick The wind is blowing lightly A
tall and thin looking figure stands with his back against a
tree

This is DURZA an almost human-like person except for his
maroon eyes and crimson hair

Durza closes his eyes and draws his sword up in front of his
face

The WIND blows again Durza SNIFFS and then opens his eyes

DURZA
Spread out and hide Stop whatever
it is coming this wayor die

Suddenly behind Durza twelve URGALS men-like creatures
with bowed LEGS and ARMS They also have two curved HORNS
above their small ears

They begin to shuffle around After a moment each of the
Urgals hide down beneath the bushes and behind the trees

Durza peers around the tree and looks up a small PATH that
goes through the forest A GUST OF WIND blows across the
forest Durza sniffs smiles and then leans back against the
tree

DURZA
(Grunting)
Get ready

An Urgal moves and a TWIG snaps Durza hisses with rage
After a moment three WHITE HORSES emerge from the darkness
at the end of the path

Two MALE ELVES sit on the right and left horses one FEMALE
ELF ARYA a beautiful black haired woman who looks to be in
her late twenties is on the center horse

The three Elves draw closer to Durza The WIND BLOWS toward
the horses They jump up on their back legs and then drop
back down on all fours

The two male elves look frightened and then their horses
start galloping Aryas horse bolts forward and leaves the
two male-elves behind
All of the Urgals jump from their hiding spots and draw their
BOWS

They launch black ARROWS at the two male-elves who fall of
their horses dead

Durza jumps out from behind the tree and lifts his hand in
the air

DURZA
Garjzla

A FIRE-BOLT launches from Durzas hand and hits Aryas horse
which is a couple hundred feet away

Arya jumps off the horse and lightning speed and lands on the
ground lightly Her horse falls down into the dirt beside
her

Quickly Arya gets up and bolts off of the path and into the
woods at inhuman speeds

DURZA
After her

All of the Urgals run after Arya Durza looks all around He
spots a large piece of GRANITE sticking up into the sky He
climbs it

Once he gets to the top of the Granite piece Durza looks out
over the treetops He raises his hand up in the air

DURZA
Ilstari boetk

A quarter mile section of the forest explodes into flames

Arya is running swiftly the trees in front of her explode
into flames She quickly turns and runs in another direction

DURZA
Ilstari boetk

Another quarter mile section of the forest burst into flames
Arya turns and runs in another direction

DURZA
Ilstari boetk

A third quarter mile section of the forest burst into flames
creating a ring of fire
Durza looks out over the large ring of fire Suddenly the
sounds of screaming Urgals are heard

He looks down again Three of the Urgals fall down to the
ground dead

Durza looks down at Arya who is running toward him at a
swift pace The remaining Urgals are chasing her

Durza peeks over the edge twenty-foot high granite piece and
then jumps to the ground right in front of Arya

Arya turns and runs in the other direction but the Urgals
surround her She turns and looks for another way out but
there is none

Durza points at Arya and smiles

DURZA
Get her

The Urgals charge in Arya pulls a pouch out of her pocket
and opens it up

She reaches inside and pulls out a beautiful SAPPHIRE STONE
and raises it above her head and quietly mumbles something in
the ANCIENT LANGUAGE A flash of light comes from the stone

Durza raises his hand toward Arya

DURZA
(Angry)
Garjzla

A fire-bolt comes from his hand and hits Arya She collapses
to the ground

Durza runs over to Arya and looks at her hands The stone is
gone

Durza howls rage and throws his sword at a tree It sticks
half way though

He then begins screaming He raises his hand and shoots nine
bolts of fire at the remaining Urgal They all drop dead
instantly

He walks over to Arya and lifts her off the ground with ease
He throws her over his shoulder and then pulls his sword from
the tree

Durza walks back to his horse and gets on putting Arya
behind him
He puts the fire in front of him out and bolts off into the
darkness

EXT FIELD - THE SPINE - NIGHT

Large MOUNTAINS surround a small FIELD ERAGON an average
looking fifteen-year-old boy with dark eyebrows and brown
eyes kneels down and places his hand on a spot of trampled
GRASS

After a moment Eragon stands to his feet and begins to walk
toward a large FOREST that rest on the side of the mountains

Eragon stops right at the edge of the forest and sighs He
pulls his BOW off of his back and knocks an ARROW He walks
into the forest

EXT A FOREST - THE SPINE - NIGHT

After a few moments Eragon comes to a quiet stop He gets
down on his knees

A large HERD of DEER sit in a small opening in the forest A
DOE is limping around on the edge of the herd because of a
broken leg

Eragon smiles and pulls the arrow back He aims for a moment
and then

A huge flash of light blast out of the middle of the herd
The deer jump up and run franticly

Eragon releases the arrow but it misses the deer Eragon
stands up He has a surprised and confused look on his face

He walks over to where the light had come from A ring of
grass is burnt The beautiful Sapphire Stone from before sits
in the middle of the ring

Eragon hesitates in fear After a moment he grabs the stone
and examines it It has little WHITE VEINS that run all over
it like a Spiderweb

He drops his PACK off his back and onto the ground He opens
it and carefully places the Stone inside

Eragon looks around and then stands to his feet He walks out
of the small opening and back into the forest Eragon finds a
large tree and throws a blanket out at the trunk of it

start to twitch

After a moment Garrow looks up from his plate and sighs

GARROW
Today is aspecial day

Eragon and Roran look up from the plates and stop eating

Sapphire Stone into it
EXT CARVAHALL - FRONT FIELD - DAWN

around looking at various things

A WAGON being pulled by horses comes over a small hill and
rides down toward the group of tents

The wagon stops to the side of all the tents Eragon and
Roran jump off the wagon Garrow slowly climbs down the side
of the wagon

Garrow puts his hands in his pocket and pulls out a few
coins He divides it up and then hands the coins to Eragon
and Roran

GARROW
Get yourselves some treats Roran
do what you want but be back at
Horst house for dinner Eragon

Roran walks away and disappears into the crowd Eragon and
Garrow walk the opposite way

Eragon and Garrow walk up to a MAN who is standing behind a
table showing off his KNIVES and SWORDS This is MERLOCK a
rough looking merchant

After a moment Merlock notices Eragon and Garrow He then
sets the sword down that he was holding and walks over to
them

MERLOCK
And what would you fine sirs be
looking for Maybe a sword Or
maybe-

He turns quickly and grabs a perfectly crafted SILVER ROSE
from the table He holds it up in front of Eragon

MERLOCK (CONTD)
A silver rose for a special lady
friend eh

GARROW

GARROW

MERLOCK

INT MERLOCKS TENT - DAY

Garrow come in behind him

Merlock picks up a stack of books off of two chairs and
gestures toward them

MERLOCK
Pleasehave a seat

Eragon and Garrow sit down

GARROW
Show him the Stone Eragon

Eragon hesitates but then pulls the Stone out of the pack and
hands it to Merlock

Merlock looks at it with an interested eye He pulls a box
out and opens it He takes a small hammer and starts to tap
it and do other various things to it After a few moments he
stops

MERLOCK

Do you know how much this is worth
GARROW

No
MERLOCK

Unfortunately neither do I But I
will tell you this much its
unlike anything Ive ever seen It
wont scratch Whoever made it used
tools Ive never seen-or maybe
magic And it’s hallow

GARROW
What

MERLOCK
Have you ever heard a rock that
sounds like this

Merlock gets the small hammer and taps the rock It echos
slightly

ERAGON
But what is it worth

MERLOCK
I cant tell you that For most
people this would be an item of
curiosity-not an item to spend
money on

Everything is silent for a few moments
GARROW
Will you buy it

MERLOCK

Noit’s not worth the risk I may
be able to find a wealthy buyer
during my spring travels but even
so youll have to wait until next
year before youll get paid

(Beat)
I am curious howeverwhy did you
want to speak to me in private

ERAGON
Because I found this in the Spine
People around here dont care to
much for the place

MERLOCK
Do you know why me and my fellow
traders were late this year

Eragon shakes his head

MERLOCK (CONTD)
Our wanderings have been dogged
with misfortune Chaos seems to
rule Alagaseia We cant seem to
avoid illness attacks and the
worse black luck Because the
Vardens attacks against the
Empire Galbatorix is calling more
men to the border Men who are
needed to fight the Urgals

Merlock stops and picks up and drinks a CUP of WATER

MERLOCK
And even worst theres talk of a
Shade though the stories are
unconfirmed Not many people
survive such an encounter

ERAGON
Why havent we heard of this

MERLOCK
Because these things have just
happened in the past few months

GARROW
Nonsense We havent seen any
Urgals

(MORE )

GARROW(contd)

The only one around here has his
horns hooked to the wall in Morns
tavern

MERLOCK
Maybe sobut this is a small
village thats hidden by mountains
No surprise that you havent been
noticed yet But if you havent
noticed strange things are
happening especially after the
appearing of that rock appearing

EXT CARVAHALL — DAY

information

INT HORSTS HOUSE - DUSK

Horst Eragon Garrow Roran and various other people sit
around a large wooden table Everyone is laughing and eating
and drinking

MORN a rough looking man leans forward with a dark look in
his eye Everyone gets quiet

MORN
Theres strange people around here
Grain buyers who cheat everyone out
of their money
(Breat)
Theyre telling ridiculous stories
about how the Varden had made a
pact with the Urgals and planned to
attack us And how it was only for
the great King Galbatorix that we
havent already be over taken by
their armies

HORST
If they keep it up theres gonna

EXT CARVAHALL —- FRONT FIELD —- NIGHT

Hundreds of people gather around a huge BONFIRE Eragon
Garrow and Roran walks up to the group of people

A DARK FIGURE BROM an older man with a large beard and
bushy eye brows stands right beside the BONFIRE Everyone is
looking at him

BROM
Before your grandfathers fathers
were born and even before their
fathers were born the Dragon
Riders were formed To protect and
guard was their mission And for
thousands of years they succeeded
Their prowess in battle was
unmatched Each of the Riders had
the strength of ten men

The crowd is now completely quiet Only the sound of Brom and
of the BONFIRE

BROM (CONTD)
They were immortal Only for good
were their powers used And as they
kept the peace the land
flourished It was a golden time
The Elves were our allies the
Dwarves our friends But it could
not last Though no enemy could
defeat them they could not guard
against themselves

(Beat)

And it came to pass that in the
golden age of Alagaesia Galbatorix
was born

EXT FIELD —- DAY

GALBATORIX is fighting with a sword a RIDER After a
moment Galbatorix hits the Riders sword out of the his
hands

BROM (VO)
At the age of ten he was tested
and the Riders found great power in
him The riders accepted him as
their own

EXT MOUNTAIN SIDE —- DAY

Galbatorix now 17 is flying through the air on the back of
a large BLACK DRAGON On the ground below him there is a
group of Urgals The Black Dragon dives toward the group

BROM (VO)
After his training was complete he
took a reckless trip with two
friends into the remaining
territory of the Urgals

Galbatorix is slaughtering the Urgals with his sword The
Black Dragon is overtaken by Urgals and is falls to the
ground dead

BROM (VO)
He killed his attackers but
tragically his dragon was killed
in the battle And thus the seeds
of madness were planted

EXT WILDERNESS —- DAY

Galbatorix is wandering through a large grass plain After a
moment he falls down to the ground unconscious

BROM (VO)
For months he wandered seeking
death but it did not come He was
found and summoned to the Riders to
be judged He demanded another
dragon but the desperation in his
voice revealed before the Council
what he truly was

EXT CARVAHALL —- FRONT FIELD —- NIGHT

Brom is standing in front of the fire looking around at the
crowd

BROM (VO)

Denied his hope Galbatorix
through the twisted mirror of
madness came to believe that it
was the Riders fault that his
dragon had been killed And so
night after night he brooded on
this and planned his
exactrevenge

(Beat)
Through some ill fortune he met a
Rider named Morzan Morzan was
strong in body but weak in mind

(Beat)
They slaughtered every Rider they
came in contact with With each
kill their strength grew Twelve
of the Riders joined them because
of the desire for power After
this Galbatorix named himself King
over Alagasesia Hes ruled us ever
since

EXT THE ROAD - PALENCAR VALLEY - NIGHT

Eragon and Roran are sitting in the back of the WAGON Garrow
is in the front controlling the horses Eragon sits still

twice and if the Empire knew he
had he wouldnt live to see
another month

INT ERAGONS ROOM - NIGHT

A small candle on Eragons DRESSER lights the room He pulls
the Sapphire Stone out of his pack and sets it own his bed

He pulls out a small wooden HAMMER and taps it After a few

A candle is lit and Eragons room comes into view Eragon is
holding it He sets the candle down on his dresser and looks
around

The SQUEAK is heard again Its coming from the Sapphire
Stone Eragon turns around and looks at it

ERAGON
(Whispering)

Eragon gets back in his bed and closes his eyes The Stone
SQUEAKS again And it begins to ROCK Eragon sits up in his
bed and scowls

ERAGON
(Whispering)
I dont care how valuable you are
Im gonna destroy you

CRACKS begin to appear on the Stone Eragon stands still and
looks at it Entranced More CRACKS appear and run straight
to the top of the Stone

After a moment a small piece at the top of the Stone breaks
away from the rest and falls to the floor A small HEAD
appears pokes out of the hole in the top of Stone

Eragon steps back from the stone After a moment a shadowed
body is standing beside the stone

Eragon looks shocked Its a baby DRAGON Its no longer than
Eragons forearm and its SCALES are deep SAPPHIRE BLUE

After a moment the dragon begins look around and walk around
the dresser

Eragon reaches out with his hand and touches it on the back
A blue FLASH comes from the dragon and launches Eragon back
onto the floor

Eragon lets out a scream After a second Eragon gets up off
the floor and listens to make sure no one is coming

Eragons hand turns red He begins to scratch it but stops
and looks at his palm in fear A large blue OVAL appears in
the skin of his palm

A few moments later a COLLAGE of VOICES can be heard Eragon
puts his hands on his head and closes his eyes

A few seconds later he throws his hands down The voices
stop Eragon is out of breath

Eragon quietly walks out of his room and closes the door

He walks back toward his room

INT ERAGONS ROOM - NIGHT

Eragon walks into the room and quietly closes the door He
takes the strip of meat and sets it beside the dragon The
dragon sniffs it at first and then starts to eat it

Eragon smiles After a moment the dragon lays down on its
back and falls asleep Eragon waits a moment and then gently
picks the dragon up and takes it over to his bed He sets it
down and then climbs onto his bed and lays down beside it

ERAGON
What am I going to do with you

EXT THE ROAD - PALENCAR VALLEY - MORNING

The sun is peeking over the tree tops Eragon runs down the
dirt road Hes holding the dragon After a moment he walks
off the path and into the FOREST

EXT THE FOREST —- PALENCAR VALLEY - SAME TIME

Eragon walks deep into the forest After a moment he stops
at a large snow covered TREE Eragon puts a small leather
blanket over the dragon and sets it up on one of the limbs

Eragon takes a small rope and ties it to the dragons leg He

and hands Eragon one of the cups

Eragon is sitting in a small rocking chair Brom sits down in
another rocking chair across from Eragon

Old BOOKS and SCROLLS are stacked up all over the room

Brom pulls a SMOKING PIPE up to his lips and lights it with a
candle that is beside him

BROM
Ahhere we go
(Beat)
Nowwhat do you want

ERAGON
Well Ive heard a lot about the
Dragon Riders and their great
accomplishments and most everyone
wants them to return But Ive
never heard any stories about how
they were started and what made
them so special

BROM
A vast subject to tell about If I
were to tell you the whole story
wed still be sitting here next
winter

Brom sucks on his pipe and lets out a smoke ring

BROM
Ill start with the last
itemDragons

Eragon settles back in his chair and sips his tea

BROM (CONTD)
Dragons have no beginning unless
it lies with the creation of
Alagaseia itself And if they have
an end it will be when this land
perishes Dragons can communicate
with their Riders also The
dragons dwarves and a few other
creatures are true inhabitants of
this land Their world was
unchanging until the first elves
sailed here in their silver ships

ERAGON
Where did the elves come from

BROM
(Scowling)
Did you want your first question
answered or not

ERAGON
(Embarrassed)
Sorry

Brom chuckles under his breath

BROM
No your not
(Beat)
If you must know the elves come
from a place they call Alalea No
one knows what or even where it
is
Brom sucks on his pipe again and lets out another smoke ring
BROM (CONTD)
In fact you were named after an
elf The first Dragon Rider to be
specific

Eragon sits up - his eyes wide open

BROM
Ahso you didnt know your
namesake

ERAGON
No

Eragon looks confused

Brom stands up and walks out of the room with his tea cup
After a moment he returns with a full cup of tea He sits
down on his chair and takes a sip of tea

ERAGON
Do you remember any of the dragon
names

BROM

Hmmlets seethere was Jura
Hirador and Fundor-who fought the
giant sea snake Galzra Briam
OhenummBeroan

Brom stops for a moment and lets a large smoke ring float
into the air

BROM
(Whispering)
And Saphira

Eragon sits back for a moment He then sets his tea cup down
on a small TABLE that is beside him and then stands up

ERAGON
Well its getting late and I

BROM
(Curious )
Eragon Why the sudden interest in
Dragons and such

ERAGON
UmmI heard a couple oftraders
talking about it

BROM

Eragon walks through the front door of the house and goes
into the kitchen Garrow and Roran are already sitting at the
table They each have a plate of food Eragon sits down at an
empty seat A plate of food is already fixed for him

For a few moments everything is silent Roran looks up at

mumbling words of three people

Eragon stops and pokes his head around the corner of the
building

Two BLACK FIGURES the RAZAC are standing in front of
Sloan

RAZAC 1
When did this happen

SLOAN
A few weeks ago

Eragon turns back around and hides behind the wall

mostunpleasant

SLOAN
(Shaken)

helpful We will not forget you

Sloan nods his head and then swiftly walks away
Eragon turns to get a better view A small ROCK is broken off

the wall It hits the ground and a loud CRACK Can be
heard

The two Razac turn and stand in a crouching position They
let out a Hiss

Eragons face fills with fear The Razac begin to slowly and
soundlessly walk toward him

Eragon

Eragon jerks around and sees Brom calling him
Brom hurries over to Eragon not seeing the Razac

The Razac stop and glare at Eragon for a moment and then
quietly slip away

Eragon falls to the ground shivering Brom pulls Eragon up

BROM
Whats wrong

ERAGON
Nothing I just got a little dizzy
all of a sudden I dont know why
though

BROM
Youll recover but perhaps youd
better go home

ERAGON
I think youre right Maybe I
should go home

Eragon looks worried
Brom holds out his hand Eragon shakes it Brom pulls his
hand back and accidently pulls Eragons GLOVE off It falls

to the ground Brom bends down and picks it up

BROM
Clumsy me

Brom stands back up and quickly turns Eragons hand over
Brom looks at the Blue Oval on Eragons palm for a quick
moment and then sets the glove in Eragons hand

Eragon quickly pulls his arm down

ERAGON
Goodbye

Eragon turns and walks away Behind him Brom starts to
whistle a merry tune

EXT THE ROAD - PALENCAR VALLEY - DUSK

Eragon is running as fast as he can down the road Sweat is
rolling down his face He comes to the end of the path About
a mile away Eragons house is sitting in a field Garrow is
standing by the BARN that is beside the house

ERAGON
I must tell him about her

Eragon closes his eyes and looks up

be heard flapping After a moment Saphira lands down in the

beside her

SAPHIRA (VO)

lets out another roar

of his head Saphira continues to jump and roar Eragon grabs
a spike on her back and pulls himself onto her back

Eragon rubs her side with his hand and he hums to her

ERAGON
Thats enough Everything is going
to be alright

Saphira calms down and then kicks off the ground and flys
into the air

Everything below is quickly disappearing The sky ahead is
zooming toward Eragon

END ERAGONS
POV

Saphira is drifting through the air She is miles above the
ground

ERAGON (VO)
We have to go back Those strangers
are coming Garrow has to be
warned

Saphira doesnt answer A few moments pass and then large
mountains come into view all around

A gust of wind batters against Eragon Saphira moves her
neck Eragon is jerked to one side He winces in pain and
looks down at the ground

Suddenly Saphira begins to spiral toward the ground After a
moment she drops into a small opening in the forest below
EXT A FOREST - THE SPINE - DUSK

As Saphira hits the ground Eragon quickly slides off her and
hits the ground

Eragons legs buckle and he falls down HE winces and then
looks down at his legs They are bleeding badly through his
pants on the inside of his thighs

ERAGON
Great

Eragon winces again

ERAGON (VO)
Why did you do this Garrow needs
our help

SAPHIRA (VO)
Murderers

ERAGON (VO)

journey when Garrow needs us and
your scales have scrapped the skin
of my legs Is that what you
wanted

stomach rumbles

What have I done

A single tear roles down Eragons face He closes his eyes

EXT GARROWS FARM - NIGHT

All is still Smoke is rising from the chimney Suddenly the
house appears to be on fire

Two black figures bust down the door of Eragons house and
walk in
INT ERAGONS HOUSE - NIGHT

Garrow runs to the door and then starts to scream

The figures are the Razac One of the Razac lifts his sword
in the air and swings it at Garrow

Everything turns white and blurs out

EXT A FOREST - THE SPINE — DAWN

Eragon panicking opens his eyes Sweat is layered across
his face

Saphira is still lying over him

ERAGON
Get up

Saphira starts to move a little bit and then stands all the
way up and moves Sunshine blinds Eragon

After a moment he gets up and wobbles over to a tree

Eragon breaks a branch off of the tree and uses it as a
crutch He looks at Saphira

ERAGON (VO)
Will you take me home

Saphira cocks her head up in the air

ERAGON (VO)
I know you dont want to but we
both owe it to Garrow He as taken
care of me and through me you Is
that a debt you are willing to
ignore

Saphira turns and looks at Eragon

ERAGON (VO)
What is to be said of us in the
years to come That we hid like
cowards while my uncle was in
trouble Even a Shade would run
from you and yet you hide in the
mountains like a frightened Rabbit

Saphira lets out a roar and jumps back onto her back legs for
a moment Then she looks at Eragon

SAPHIRA (VO)
I will take you because of a debt
owed But into foolishness we fly

Eragon looks up into the sky

ERAGON
Foolishness or not there is no
other choice

Eragon takes a knife from his pocket and cuts two parts of
his shirt off He walks over to Saphira and slowly and
painfully climbs onto her back

Eragon takes the two pieces of shirt and puts them under his
thighs Saphira jumps into the air Eragon winces

ERAGON (VO)
Faster

burning barn Eragon looks scared Saphira dives down toward
the ground

Saphira lands on the ground Eragons house and barn is
collapsed Some wood is still burning Eragon jumps off

looks scared angry and shocked

house

ERAGON

Eragon starts looking through the scraps of wood He is still
crying

ERAGON
This is your fault If you hadnt
taken me away

SAPHIRA (VO)
You would not be alive if we had
stayed

ERAGON (VO)
We could have warned him

Eragon drops to his butt and grabs his legs in pain For a
moment he just looks around in tears Then he spots
something A pale hand is sticking up out of the wood

Eragon rushes over to the hand and pulls the wood away

Its Garrow His face is burnt and deformed and so is the
rest of his body

Eragon grabs Garrows hand and starts to cry even harder

ERAGON
Uncle

Eragon looks over Garrows body for a moment Garrows other
hand has a piece of torn black fabric that matches the
clothes of the Razac

Eragon takes the piece of fabric and holds it up Anger and
rage fills his eyes

EXT THE ROAD - PALENCAR VALLEY - DAY

Garrows body is tied up to two boards that are hooks to
Saphiras stomach

couple of miles ahead

Saphira buckles her wings and drops toward the ground

EXT THE ROAD - PALENCAR VALLEY - DAY

Saphira lands on the ground softly and bends down Eragon
painfully slides off and walks around to Garrows body

Eragon untied Garrow and sets him on the ground He then
takes one of the boards and roles Garrow onto it and ties him
down

ERAGON (VO)
Find yourself a place to hide
Youll have to take care of
yourself for a while

SAPHIRA (VO)
I will wait

Saphira walks into the forest Eragon grabs the board and
begins to pull Garrow down the road

Eragon grits his teeth in pain as blood pours out of his
legs He stops after a moment and looks into the sky

For a moment Eragon waits and then starts to walk again

A moment passes Brom has an unreadable look on his face
Eragon waits for a moment and then walks into what is left
of his house

He searches for the spot that his room once was and finds
it He looks around for a moment and then finds his BOW

Its a little scuffed up but its not unusable

He looks around for a bit more and finds his QUIVER The
leather isnt harmed at all He smiles satisfied

After a moment Eragon walks over to Saphira and Brom

There is now a FIRE in the center of the clearing Brom and
Eragon are sitting by it Saphira is curled up around them

Why do you want to travel with me

A ring of smoke rises from Broms mouth

BROM
I have vested interest in keeping
you alive

a fine story

kings control in over a thousand years What will happen to
you Will you die a martyr Join the Varden Or will you kill
King Galbatorix All fascinating questions And I will be
there to see every bit of it

A few moments pass Eragon gazes into the fire

ERAGON
That may be but tell me how can
you talk to Saphira

Brom takes a few moments to put more TOBACCO into his pipe

BROM
Very well If its answers you
want its answers youll get but
they may not be to your liking

Brom stands up and walks over to his Pack near the edge of
the clearing He picks it up and sets it down by the fire

He then opens the Pack and pulls out a long OBJECT around
three feet long that is wrapped in CLOTH

Slowly Brom pulls the cloth away from the object revelling
a SWORD

The Sword has a golden handle that has a red RUBY the size of
a bird egg engraved in it Its BLADE is crimson red

After all of the cloth is pulled away Brom hands the Sword
to Eragon

BROM
This was once a Riders blade Its
name is Zarroc

Eragon swings it around a few times

ERAGON
Whered you get it

Brom takes a few moments and then answers

BROM
It doesnt matter All I will say
is that it took me many nasty and
dangerous adventures to attain it

Eragon swings it one more time

BROM (CONTD)
Consider it yours You have more of
a claim to it than I do And before
all is done I think you will need
it

Eragon holds the sword up and looks at the blade

ERAGON
It is a princely gift Im honored

Brom walks over to his Pack and pulls out a BELT with a large
SHEATH on it He walks back to Eragon and hands it to him

Eragon takes it and slowly slides the sword into it

BROM
Now if you must know anyone can
learn to speak to a dragon with
the right knowledge

(MORE )

BROM(contd)
I know more about dragons than
almost everyone else aliveIm
offering my knowledge to you as a
shortcut for by yourself it would
take you years to learn

How I know so much I will keep to myself
Eragon and Brom sit down by the fire again

ERAGON
Do you have knowledge of the
strangers

BROM
Ah yes They are called the
Razac They werent seen before
Galbatorix was king Little is
known about them but I can tell
you one thing they arent human
When I glimpsed one of their heads
I saw something that resembled a
beak and they have small beady
eyes How they manage to speak our
tongue baffles me

Brom lights his pipe and sucks in smoke and lets it out as a
ring

BROM
As for their powers they are
stronger than any man and can jump
incredible heights but they cannot
use magic Be thankful for that
for if they could you would
probably already be in their grasp

ERAGON
How many are there

BROM
As far as I know only the two
youve seen But there could be

more

ERAGON
Why were they searching for
Saphira

BROM

Theyre the kings personal dragon
hunters Whenever rumor of a dragon
or dragon egg is heard by the king
he sends them to search for it
Everything is silent for a little while

ERAGON
Whered you get that scar on your
head

BROM

I was sneaking around the Razacs
campsite one night trying to find
as my information about them as I
could when they surprised me from
the shadows I managed to get away
but not without this token of my
stupidity

Eragon lays back and looks into the sky

ERAGON
When you saw the scar on my palm
why didnt you warn me about the
Razac I could have warned Garrow

BROM

(Apologetic)
I was unsure of what to do at the
time I thought I could keep the
Razac away from you until they
left and then confront you about
Saphira But they outsmarted me
Its a mistake that I deeply regret
and has cost you dearly

Eragon sits up with a demanding look on his face

ERAGON
Who are you Ive trusted you this
far because Saphira respects you
but no more Why does a storyteller
happen to have a Riders blade Why
do you know so much about the
Raz ax

BROM
I thought I made it clear I wasnt
going to talk about that

ERAGON
My uncle is dead because of you
Dead Youre not the person Ive
known all these years Explain
yourself

A few long moments pass as Brom lets out smoke rings from
his mouth

BROM
You probably havent thought about
it but most of my life has been
spent out of Carvahall Ive played
many roles to many people Ive a
complicated past

ERAGON
Then who are you

BROM
Im someone who wants to help you-
do not scorn those words for they
are the truest Ive ever spoken
But I will not answer your
questions

ERAGON
Im going to sleep

Eragon looks at the stars for a moment and then closes his
eyes

EXT THE FOREST —- PALENCAR VALLEY - DAWN

Eragon opens his eyes A few tears run down his cheeks After
a moment he wipes them away and stands up

Brom is cooking breakfast over the fire Eragon walks over
and sits down by the fire with his hands under his armpits

BROM
Good morning

Eragon grunts in reply After a few moments Eragon stands up
and walks over to his pack He pulls out a large piece of
leather

BROM
What are you going to do with that

ERAGON
Make a saddle for Saphira

BROM
Oh
(Beat)
Well lets see there are two types
of saddles for dragons
(MORE )

BROM(contd)

One that takes time and tools to
make two things we dont have and
one that is nothing more than a
layer between the rider and the
dragon

ERAGON
Do you know what they look like

BROM
Better I can make one

EXT THE FOREST - PALENCAR VALLEY - LATER

Brom ties two final straps of leather together and then
stands up holding a completed saddle HE walks over to
Saphira She bends down a little allowing Brom to put the
saddle on her back

Brom walks over to Eragon and looks at Saphira

ERAGON
Thank you

Brom walks over to the fire Eragon turns to follow him but
stops when Saphira says-

SAPHIRA (VO)
Arent you going to try it out

ERAGON (VO)
Maybe tomorrow Its late

EXT THE FOREST —- PALENCAR VALLEY - NIGHT

Brom and Eragon are lying down by the fire Brom is smoking
his pipe and Eragon is staring into the fire

BROM
Eragon Im sorry for the way
things turned out I didnt mean
for any of this to happen

Eragon doesnt respond and avoids Broms eyes A few moments
pas

BROM
Well need to get horses in
Therinsford tomorrow

ERAGON
You do but I have Saphira

Brom shakes his head
BROM
I cant keep up with a dragon and
itll be safer if we travel
together
EXT THE FOREST - PALENCAR VALLEY - DAWN
The sky is gray and the wind is blowing

Eragon and Brom are walking through the forest Eragons
sword Zarroc is tied to his waist

Saphira soars over the forest and then darts into the clouds

EXT A FIELD - PELENCAR VALLEY - LATER

Eragon and Brom are walking through a large field A few
miles ahead the large village of THERINSFORD can be seen

The buildings and HOMES sit in no particular order and look
fairly run down

Eragon and Brom stop and look at it in disgust

EXT THE STREET —- THERINSFORD - LATER

Eragon and Brom walk down the crowded street A young BOY
runs past Brom

Brom turns and grabs the Boy by the shoulder The Boy turns
around and looks at Brom

BROM
Do you know where we can buy
horses
The Boy points up the street where a small barn can be seen
BROM
Thank you
INT HABERTHS BARN - MOMENTS LATER

The doors are open to the barn Horse stalls line each side
of the building all the way to the back

A middle-aged man HABERTH is grooming a beautiful white
stallion SNOWFIRE

Eragon and Brom walk into the barn Haberth looks up at them
as they walk over to him

BROM
Thats a beautiful animal

HABERTH
Yes it is Its name is Snowfire
Mines Haberth
Brom and Haberth shake hands

HABERTH
Can I help you

BROM
We need two fast horses with a full
set of tack for both

Haberth walks to the back of the barn and grabs two saddles
off the wall He sets them on the ground

Haberth walks over to a BAY horse He also looks at the BAY
in the stall beside the first

HABERTH
Will these do

Brom looks at the first Bay

BROM
Well wake him

Brom looks at the second

BROM
The other Im not so sure of
HABERTH
Hes got a good pair of legs on
‘em
BROM
Mmmhow much will you take
Snowfire

Haberth glances at Snowfire

HABERTH
I do not wish to sell him Hes the
finest Ive ever bred

BROM
If you were willing to part with
him how much would all this cost
me

Haberth doesnt respond for a moment

HABERTH
200 coins no less

Brom pulls out a bag of coins and counts through it After a
moment he hands it to Haberth

BROM
Will this do

Haberth looks in the bag of coins and then at Snowfire

EXT THE STREET —- THERINSFORD - MOMENTS LATER

Brom is leading Snowfire down the street by his reigns and
Eragon is guiding the Bay

Brom quickly leads Snowfire into a small ALLEY between two
houses Eragon follows him confused

BROM
Take Snowfire and go to the far
side of Therinsford Wait for me
there

Brom hands Eragon the reigns to Snowfire Eragon looks at the
reigns still confused

ERAGON
Why

Brom is already gone Eragon shakes his head

EXT SIDE FIELD - THERINSFORD —- DAY

Eragon is standing right outside the SIDE GATE to Therinsford

After a moment Brom walks through the gate and to Eragon
Brom grabs Snowfires reigns and begins to walk away from
Therinsford

BROM
Come

EXT FOREST — DAY

Eragon is walking toward the edge of the forest holding the
Bays reigns Brom is behind him guiding Snowfire

After a moment Eragon and Brom enter the forest Brom jumps
onto Snowfires saddle Eragon looks at the Bay nervous

BROM
Hurry we have far to go

Eragon slowly mounts the Bay and looks at Brom Brom nods his
head and then Snowfire begins to walk through the forest

Eragon struggles to get the Bay to move but after a moment
they begin to walk behind Brom

BROM
The Razac have defiantly been
through here A man back in town
told me He said they fled like
demons from a holy man

ERAGON
But why would they come through
therinsford
BROM
Apparently to get horses like us
EXT FOREST - DUSK

Eragon and Brom ride their horses into a small clearing and
then slide off the saddles and look around

Eragon turns and looks at the Bay

BROM
You should name him

Eragon rubs the side of the Bays face
ERAGON
I dont have anything as majestic

as Snowfire but maybe thisll do

Eragon pauses for a moment

ERAGON
I name you Cadoc

Eragon looks at Brom

ERAGON
It was my grandfathers name

Brom nods approvingly
Eragon sits down and arranges a small pile of tender

Suddenly Saphira crashes through the trees and lands in the
clearing

Eragon and Brom look at her

ERAGON (VO)
How do the plains look

SAPHIRA (VO)
Dull Only Rabbits and small shrub
can be seen for miles

Eragon shakes his head and turns around

BROM
Catch

A wooden sword cracks into Eragons forehead Eragon yelps in
pain and grabs his head

Eragon looks up at Brom who is flying toward him with his
own sword

Eragon jumps out of the way and grabs the wooden sword Brom
had thrown at him

Brom obviously better than Eragon smacks Eragon on the back
of the leg with the sword Eragon falls to the ground and
yelps

ERAGON
What are you doing

Brom plunges toward Eragon again and cracks the wooden blade
of his sword across Eragon’s chest Eragon gasp’s for air and
falls down again

ERAGON
Are you mad

BROM
Well you can’t just go fight the
Raz’ac Look at you Can’t even
stay on your feet

Eragon stands up and grabs his wooden sword He runs toward
Brom and swings the sword at him

Brom quickly dodges the attack and slaps Eragon on the back

EXT FOREST -— DAWN

The sun is just rising over the tree tops Eragon and Saphira
are sleeping

Brom quickly runs over to Eragon and shakes him

BROM
Eragon wake up

And then walks over to his backpack and continues to pack
things up

Eragon slowly opens his eyes and slowly sits up wincing at
the pain in his body He grunts

BROM
Good morning

Eragon scowls

BROM
I just want you to be ready when we
find them

Eragon slowly stands to his feet

ERAGON
I won’t be able to move if we meet
them much less fight

Behind him Saphire picks her head up off the ground She
stands up

BROM
We need to get a move on it We’ve
got a mile to go before we reach
the plains
EXT FOREST - LATER

Eragon is riding Cadoc and Brom is on Snowfire They are

quickly traveling downhill

EXT THE PLAIN’S —- DAY

Eragon and Brom on their horses backs come
forest and stop at the edge of the plains

To the right of Eragon and Brom about a half
ANORA RIVER can be seen It stretches off in
direction of Brom and Eragon Brom points at

BROM
That’s the Anora River and our
only source of water from until we
reach Yazuac which is where I
think the Raz’ac have gone

ERAGON
Where’s that

in front of them is a pile of

his noes and looks away Brom

Eragon looks down at the pile Lying in the pile is a
lifeless middle-aged woman She is holding tightly to her a
dead baby

Tears form in Eragon’s eyes He looks away
BROM
Do you want to wait outside the

city until I’m done

ERAGON
No I’m fine

Brom looks around for a moment Suddenly two Urgal’ jump out
of nowhere and attack Brom They each have AXES

Brom fights back with his sword with obvious skill and
knowledge of the blade

After a moment one of the Urgal’s Axes hacks into Brom’s
arm He screams

Eragon begins to panic

ERAGON
What do I do What I do

Suddenly Eragon jumps off of Cadoc holding his sword
Zar’oc and starts running toward them screaming in fear and
rage

The Urgal’s look surprised but turn and begin to defend

themselves After a few moments of fighting Eragon turns and
runs away leading the Urgal’s into an alley

EXT YUZUAC - ALLEY - SAME TIME

Eragon runs into the alley and realizes its a dead-end He
turns around but the Urgal’s already have him cornered

Eragon drops his sword and pulls his BOW and ARROW from his
back He aims it at the Urgal Eragon fires but it hits the
Urgal’s shield

Eragon gets another arrow and aims it at the Urgal’s again
He closes his eyes and lets out a deep breath

After a moment he lets the string go and screams-

ERAGON
Brisingr

The arrow lights on fire with a blue flame and hits the lead
Urgal in the forehead A shock-wave of blue explodes from the
arrow and kills all the other Urgal’s but passes through
Eragon

Eragon looks surprised at what he just did He looks at the
symbol on his palm It’s glowing brightly He bends down
EXT YUZUAC - STREET - MOMENTS LATER

Eragon runs over to Brom and helps him off his horse Eragon
looks at Brom’s arm It’s badly damaged

Eragon closes his eyes and looks up for a moment

After a few moments pass Saphira lands in the street in
rage

SAPHIRA (VO)
Where are the ones who did this
I’1ll rip them apart

ERAGON
They’re dead

SAPHIRA (VO)
You killed them

Eragon nods his head
ERAGON (VO)

back Saphira

Brom sits up wincing at the pain in his arm

BROM
No I’m fine Really We must leave

EXT FRONT FIELD - TEIRM —- MOMENTS LATER

Eragon and Brom slow their horses down to a walk Eragon
looks at Brom

ERAGON
Will we go by our own names

BROM
No People have a tendency to
remember things they shouldn’t I

nephew Evan

Eragon looks up at the sky For just a second though the
clouds Eragon sees Saphira’s body fly by He closes his
eyes

ERAGON (VO)
You should land somewhere and hide
We’re going in

SAPHIRA (VO)
Sticking your noses where it
doesn’t belongagain

Eragon opens his eyes and shakes his head with a slight
smile

After a moment Eragon and Brom come to the front gate of
Teirm

EXT FRONT GATE - TEIRM —- SAME TIME

Eragon and Brom slowly ride through the gate The guards eye
them suspiciously

EXT THE STREET - TEIRM —- SAME TIME

Eragon and Brom slowly ride down the crowded streets Among
the ROOFTOPS KNIGHTS are stationed All along the streets
Knights can be seen standing around

Everyone seems to have an unpleasant look about them

ERAGON
This place looks ready for war

BROM
Teirm has a history of getting
attacked by Pirates Urgal’s and
other enemies Teirm is the center
of commerce Conflict will always
arise where riches are so abundant

ERAGON
Oh

Eragon and Brom continue to ride down the street After a
moment Brom turns down another street Eragon realizes it
and starts to follow him

ERAGON
Where are we going

BROM
My old friend lives down this road
if I remember correctly

EXT JEOD’S HOUSE - TEIRM —- LATER

JEOD’s HOUSE is two stories high and is connected to
buildings on the left and right It looks to be lived in by
someone rich

Brom knocks on the wooden door After a moment he knocks
again A moment later the sounds of feet moving toward the
door can be heard

The door slightly cracks open Through the crack we can see
the eyes of JEOD a gray haired and weary looking man

JEOD
Who is it Do you have an
appointment

BROM
No

JEOD
Well then you’1l have to come back
at a later time I’m very busy

Jeod starts to close the door but Brom stops it with his
foot

BROM
Won’t you let us in for only a
moment We’ve come a long way to
see you and can’t stay long

Jeod opens the door a bit more His eyes widen as he sees
Brom

JEOD
Brom

BROM
ShhI don’t want anyone to know
our names

Jeod opens the door enough that he can get a good look at
Brom

JEOD
I--I--thought you were dead

BROM
It’s been a long time

Jeod looks around the street wearily and then motions for
Brom and Eragon to come inside

JEOD
Please come in
INT JEOD’S HOUSE - SAME TIME

Jeod Brom and Eragon walk down a long HALLWAY Eragon looks
around curiously

After a moment they all come to a stop in front of a large
wooden double-door

Brom looks down at Eragon

BROM
Eragon why don’t you look around
outside for a little while at let
us talk about a few things

Eragon nods his head and turns around
BROM
Try not to draw attention to
yourself though I don’t want
anyone knowing we’re here

Eragon nods his head again and then turns to walk out the
door

EXT THE STREET - TEIRM - DAY

Eragon walks out of Jeod’s house and into the street He
looks around Connected to the right of Jeod’s house is a
small SHOP Inside through small windows PLANTS can be seen
Eragon waits a moment and then walks toward the door of the
Shop

INT SHOP - TEIRM - MOMENTS LATER

Eragon walks in through the door and walks through the small
Shop All around plants and flowers sit on small wooden
table

After a moment a large WERECAT a slightly abnormal looking
cat like creature walks up and purrs at Eragon Eragon looks

down at it Eragon closes his eyes

ERAGON (VO)
I am a friend

After a moment a voice is heard

WERECAT (VO)
You don’t have to do that

Eragon opens his eyes

ERAGON (VO)
Saphira

Eragon looks around After a moment he closes his eyes
again Eragon looks around and sees what looks like a wooden
rod He reaches out for it

WERECAT (VO)
That wouldn’t be wise

Eragon looks up in surprise

ERAGON (VO)
Stop playing games Saphira

Eragon turns and reaches for the wooden rod again He grabs
it Suddenly a shock of electricity shoots through Eragon
He falls to the ground writhing After a moment he stops
The Cat walks over to him

WERECAT (VO)
You aren’t very smart for a dragon
Rider I did warn you

Eragon’s eyes get big

ERAGON (VO)
You said that

WERECAT (VO)
Who else

ERAGON (VO)
But you’re just a cat

The Werecat jumps on Eragon’s chest and sticks its claws into
him

WERECAT (VO)
Do I look like other cats to you

ERAGON (VO)
No

WERECAT (VO)
Then what makes you think I am one

Eragon starts to say something but the Werecat digs its
claws into his chest even more

WERECAT (VO)
I-to correct you-am a Werecat
There aren’t many of us left but I
would have thought a farm boy would
have heard of us

ERAGON (VO)
I didn’t know you were real

WERECAT (VO)

Knowing and being are two different
things I didn’t know you existed
before you came in here and ruined
my nap but that doesn’t mean you
were real does it

ERAGON (VO)
I’m sorry I disturbed you

WERECAT (VO)
I was getting up anyway

The Werecat jumps off Eragon and starts to walk away

ERAGON (VO)
Wait What’s your name

WERECAT (VO)
You may call me Solembum

Suddenly a woman walks up to Eragon This is ANGELA a
blond haired and slightly crazy looking woman

Eragon looks up at her and jumps to his feet

ERAGON
I’m sorryI was

ANGELA
Talking to the Werecat

ERAGON
You can talk to him too

ANGELA
Of course Anyone can That doesn’t
mean he’1l talk back though

There’s a bit of silence

ANGELA
Now tell me I haven’t seen you
around here before What brought
you here and where are you going

ERAGON
The first I can’t answer and the
secondmy future is impossible to
see

ANGELA
Well lets fix that

Eragon looks confused

INT SHOP —- BACK ROOM - LATER

Eragon and Angela sit around a small table Angela is holding
three bones

ERAGON
Ready

Eragon nods

ANGELA
Manin Wyrda Hugin

Angela throws the bones out onto the table She studies them
for a moment and then lets out a long sigh

ERAGON
What’s wrong

ANGELA
This is the hardest reading I’ve
ever done You were right Your
future is nigh impossible to see
I’ve never seen someone’s fate so
tangled

Eragon and Angela sit in silence for a little while

ANGELA
Well-

Angela points at one of the bones
ANGELA (CONT’D)
Ill start here because its the
easiest to understand
Angela stops for a moment and thinks
ANGELA
Infinity or long life It’s the
first time I’ve ever seen it come

up in a persons future

Angela puts her hand on the three bones

ANGELA
Now the bones grow harder to read
Here the wandering path lightning
bolt and sailing ship all lie
together-a pattern I have never
seen only heard of
(Beat)
The wandering path means you have
many choices in your future some
you are making even now I see
battles raging all around you Many
futures await you-all of them
leading to blood and conflict

Angela closes her eyes for a moment

ANGELA
The lightning bolt is a terrible
omen There is a doom upon you but
of what sort I know not Part of it
lies with in a death-one that
rapidly approaches and will cause
you much grief But the rest awaits
in a great journey Look closely at
this bone and you will see that it
rest on the sailing ship which is
impossible to misunderstand It
means that you will leave this land
forever never to return But to
where is a mystery

Angela opens her eyes

ANGELA
Next is a bit more pleasant

Angela smiles

ANGELA (CONT’D)
An epic romance I’m not sure if
this love will end happily but
your love is of noble birth and
heritage

Eragon smiles

ANGELA
Now the last ones are the tree and
the hawthorn root which cross each
other strongly I wish this were
not so-for it can only mean more
trouble-but betrayal is clear
(MORE )

ANGELA(contd)
And it will come from within your
family

ERAGON
Roran wouldn’t do that

ANGELA
I wouldn’t knowbut the bones
have never lied

ERAGON
Well thank you for reading my
future But I really must be going

ANGELA
Your welcome But tell me what is
your name

ERAGON
Eva-I mean Eragon

ANGELA
Is that who you are or your name

ERAGON
(Smiling)
Both

ANGELA
Well then now I’m all the more
interested in seeing how your life
turns out

Eragon smiles

EXT JEOD’S HOUSE - TEIRM —- DAY

Eragon walks up onto the porch and into the house

INT JEOD’S HOUSE - TEIRM —- DAY

Eragon walks down the hallway and comes to the large double-

door He is about to open it but hears Brom and Jeod’s voices
inside He stops and looks through the crack in the middle of
the door

JEOD (0S)
So ourfriends knew that you were
alive all along

BROM (0OS)
Yes

Jeod and Brom continue to talk but low enough that they
cannot be understood

Eragon steps back with a confused look on his face After a
moment he steps forward and walks into the large OFFICE

Books and scrolls are stacked all around the walls and in
book cases A small desk sits in front of a large window
(that is closed) Brom and Jeod are sitting in two rocking
chairs opposite of each other

Brom and Jeod stop talking when Eragon comes in They look up
at him

EXT JEOD’S HOUSE - TEIRM - NIGHT

The streets are no longer crowded No one can be seen except
for Knights scattered all over the roof tops of the city
INT JEOD’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Eragon and Brom are each sitting in two chairs in front of a
small fireplace Behind them are two small beds and a window

but that’s it

Eragon looks at Brom who is staring into the fire

ERAGON
Brom

BROM
Hmm

ERAGON

Who are yourfriends that Jeod
was talking about earlier

Brom doesn’t answer for a minute

BROM
He was talking about the Varden

ERAGON
I heard talk about them back at
Thorns bar Everyone says that they
seek to destroy us all

BROM
Nothey seek to destroy
evilKing Galbatorix

ERAGON
Will we go to them after the
Raz’zac are destroyed

BROM
I don’t know

ERAGON
Where are they

BROM
They lie somewhere in the Beor
Mountains across the Hadarack
desert

Eragon sits back in his chair
BROM

You best get some rest We leave

EXT FRONT FIELD — TEIRM —- DAWN

Eragon and Brom ride quickly across the front field of Teirm

EXT MOUNTAIN SIDE —- DAY

Eragon and Brom ride down a small path cut into the side of
the MOUNTAIN Mountains surround them everywhere in the
background

Above them Saphira can be seen flying through the clouds

EXT MOUNTAIN SIDE —- CAMP —- NIGHT

Eragon and Brom are sitting beside a small fire Eragon looks
up at Brom

ERAGON
I had an idea

BROM
What kind of idea

ERAGON
Is it possible to conjure an image
of something you can’t see with
magic

BROM
What you are talking about is
scrying It can be extremely
helpful but it has its drawbacks
If you were to scry the Raz’zac
you wouldn’t be able to see their
surroundings because you haven’t
seen it before

ERAGON
How does it work Do you make an
image in thin air

BROM
Not usually It’s easier to do it
in a reflective surface such as a
pool of water or mirror

ERAGON
May I try it

BROM
No not now You’re tired and
scrying takes lots of strength I
will tell you the words you have to
say but you must promise me you
will not attempt it tonight

ERAGON
I promise

Brom leans forward a bit

BROM
Draumr kopa

Eragon closes his eyes and mouths the words a few times to
memorize it

ERAGON
Maybe tomorrow I can scry Roran
I’m afraid that the Raz’zac might
go after him

Brom leans back and sighs

BROM
I don’t mean to frighten you but
that is a distinct possibility
Although Roran was gone while the
Raz’zac were in Caravahall I’m
sure they still asked questions
about him

(MORE )

BROM(contd)

If they get frustrated enough
they’11l go back and interrogate
Roran It’s only a matter of time

In the darkness of the forest that grows on the Mountain
side a loud rustling can be heard Brom looks into the
darkness

BROM
(Whispering)
What was that

Eragon looks over into the forest

ERAGON
I don’t know

BROM
Must have been a bird or something
I thought I saw something though

Suddenly Eragon screams out in pain and falls to the ground
unconscious

Eragon’s eyes open His vision is blurry for a few moments
but it clears up after a moment and everything comes into
view

END ERAGON’S POV

Tears are rushing out of Eragon’s eyes He winces at the pain
in the back of his head where a bunch of dried up blood is

After a moment he begins to panic as he realizes that his
arms and legs are tied together He looks around and sees
Brom is tied up but is unconscious

A hissing laugh can be heard off screen Out from the woods
walks two Raz’zac One is slightly taller than the other

The tall Raz’zac walks over to Eragon who is struggling to
get free

RAZAC 1
None of that now

The second and shorter Raz’zac walks over to Brom and drags
him a few feet in front of Eragon

The Raz’zac pulls Brom’s head back and holds a dagger to his
throat Just then an ARROW flies out of nowhere and strikes
the Raz’zac in the shoulder He lets out a loud howl and then
drops to the ground avoiding another arrow

The taller Raz’zac rushes over to the shorter one and pulls
him behind a small rock a few feet away

Brom stands up and stumbles toward Eragon

ERAGON
Get down

Brom drops to his knees in front of Eragon His eyes turn red
and become blood-shot He falls forward The Raz’zac’s dagger
is sticking out of his back

ERAGON
(Screaming)
No

Eragon’s head slowly falls backward and then passes out
again

lying on the ground in a large CAVE Beside him lies Saphira
asleep

black haired man with battered clothes sitting by a small
fire In Murtagh’s lap is a BOW and behind him is a gray war-
hours called TORNAC

ERAGON
Who are you

Murtagh tightens his grip on his Bow

MURTAGH
Murtagh

ERAGON
Why did you help us

MURTAGH
You aren’t the only enemies of the
Razzac

After a moment Eragon stands up and tries to walk but falls
backward as pain explodes in his side He yelps as he falls
to the ground

Murtagh tries to run over to Eragon but Saphira blocks his
way and lets out a loud “growl”

MURTAGH
I would have helped you earlier
but your dragon wouldn’t let me

ERAGON

(Wincing)
Her name’s Saphira

Eragon looks up at Saphira
ERAGON (VO)
Now let him through He saved our
lives

Saphira lets out another “growl” and moves out of the way

Murtagh quickly walks over to Eragon and helps him to his
feet

ERAGON
How is Brom

Eragon with Murtagh’s help walks over to Brom who is
sleeping

the surface I don’t know what
damage may have been caused on the
inside

BROM
Come closer

Eragon slides a bit closer to Brom’s body

BROM

palm that Eragon has

Eragon looks at it with surprise

painfully burn through your
insides Now tell me

Hundreds of Kull and Urgal’s begin to flood the Valley
attacking Eragon and Murtagh

Eragon and Murtagh are pushed back to the edge of the water
Three Kull run toward Eragon but right before they get to
him Saphira jumps out of the water growling The Kull stop

in their tracks and begin to back away

Saphira swings her long neck forward and grabs two of the
Kull in her mouth and then throws them into the air

Saphira jumps into the air grabbing three Urgal’s with her
claws crushing them She slings their bodies into the crowd
of monsters

Eragon and Murtagh continue to fight obviously tired

A Kull jumps on Eragon sending him flying back into the

looks surprised Beside Eragon is Murtagh

He looks in front of him VARDEN SOLDIERS are fighting the

Orik turns and leads the horses down another tunnel
After a moment Egraz turns off into a large ROOM
Egraz stops in the middle of the room knife still around
Murtagh’s neck and motions for Eragon and Saphira to stand
in front of him

ERAGON

The elf she needs medicine She’s
going to die
EGRAZ
No one will leave this room until
youve been tested

ERAGON
But she’1l-

EGRAZ
Your words are meaningless until
youve been tested

Suddenly Orik walks into the room

ORIK
Don’t be a fool Egraz Ajihad will
have both our heads if we allow an
elf to die

Egraz’s eyes narrow

EGRAZ
Very well Take her to a healer

The Varden Soldiers carry Arya out of the room

Nowprepare to be examined

Eragon looks straight into Egraz’s eyes

ERAGON
I’m ready

Orik stands beside Egraz

Else the King will have words for
you

Egraz looks at Orik annoyed And then smiles

EGRAZ
Only if he resists

Egraz and Eragon both close their eyes Egraz holds his

right hand out in front of him and chants our inaudible

words

Everything but Eragon and Egraz is gone Eragon winces

An image of Garrow’s dead body flashes by and then

disappears

An image of Durza sitting in the Jail Cell flashes by and
then disappears

Eragon begins to tremble at the pain Everything becomes
distorted and then everything comes into view

Eragon falls forward gasping for air
Egraz pushes Murtagh forward where Eragon was just standing

EGRAZ
You’re turn

Fear grows in Murtagh’s eyes Egraz chants more inaudible
words and everything but Murtagh and himself disappears

Surprise covers Egraz’s face Everything distorts and then
becomes clear as everything comes back into view

Egraz looks around in fear and surprise

ORIK
What is it

EGRAZ
Guards Guards Take this man away

ERAGON
For what

Egraz points at Murtagh
EGRAZ
Hehe is the son of Morzan the
one who betrayed the Riders to
Galbatorix

Eragon looks shocked and sad All is silent Murtagh looks at
Eragon sadly

skinned man in his late 30’s

Ajihad turns and looks at Eragon and Saphira who stop in
front of his desk

AJTIHAD
Welcome Eragon

Eragon nods his head

ERAGON
Thank you

There is a long moment of silence Ajihad looks sad

AJTIHAD
The loss of Brom brings great
sadness to my heart But he did
leave something behind Something
that will ensure our success

Eragon looks confused

AJIHAD
You

ERAGON
What do you expect me to accomplis

AJTIHAD
I will explain in full later-now
there are mor urgent matters The
news of Galbatorix forming an
alliance with the Urgal is serious
If Galbatorix if gathering an Urgal
army to attack us the Varden will
be hard-pressed to survive

There is a moment of silence

AJTIHAD
For now you need rest In the
morning you will train with our
Varden Soldiers I fear the use of
a blade will soon be a necessary
thing

Eragon nods and walks away

black-handled thin SWORD from her back and holds it out in
front of her

Eragon looks worried

Arya jumps forward jabbing her sword toward Eragon’s
stomach

Eragon surprised jumps back Arya’s sword barely misses
him

Eragon swings Zar’roc at Arya She quickly hits it aside and
swings her sword toward Eragon Eragon blocks it

walk slowly toward Hrothgar

Both of them stop before the throne and bow

Eragon slightly opens his eyes looking around

ERAGON
What is it
ORIK
You and your dragon must come
quickly
ERAGON
Why
ORIK

Ajihad summons you to Fathen Dur

Eragon sighs

INT TUNNEL - NIGHT

Eragon and Saphira follow Orik who is walking very quickly
through the Tunnel

INT FARTHEN DUR - NIGHT

Six thousand Varden Soldiers and DWARVEN WARRIORS are crowded
together

At the very front of the army is Ajihad Arya and Hrothgar

A few Dwarf Warriors step forward in front of Saphira and
Eragon as they walk toward Ajihad and the others

DWARF WARRIOR
We must take your dragon

ERAGON
Why

HROTHGAR
To dress her in the ancient armor

Eragon nods and the Dwarf Warriors walk away Saphira follows
them

Eragon walks up to Ajihad fear in his eyes

ERAGON
What’s going on

AJTIHAD
A group of dwarfs spotted thousands
of Urgal’s and Kull marching
through the underground tunnels
They will be here within the hour

ERAGON
They outnumber us
AJTIHAD
Yes
(Beat)

We have collapsed the tunnels that
lead to the city of Tronjheim They
will have no choice but to come
from those tunnels

(Beat)

Once they come we must keep them
from ever getting to Tronjheim If
they get there they will kill the
woman and children

Ajihad points into the distance where large TUNNEL DOORS
are

Ajihad turns and puts his hand on the shoulder of a MAN
AJTIHAD
Eragon this Jormunder my most
trusted advisor and second in
command of the Varden

Eragon nods

EXT FARTHEN DUR - NIGHT
All is silent The Varden Soldiers look scared

Eragon now wearing armor is standing beside a fully armored
Saphira

Suddenly from the Tunnel Doors light begins to flicker The
loud yells of the Urgal’s and Kull can be heard

Arya looks into the distance at the Tunnel Doors

Eragon in the chest with a large CLUB sending Eragon flying
into the ground

Saphira continues to fly upward

Eragon fights off a few Urgal’s
ERAGON (VO)

Behind Eragon an Urgal lifts it’s sword ready to drop it
into Eragon’s head

Suddenly a blade hits it’s throat sending it’s head flying
off

Eragon turns around revealing Angela dressed in a black
robe and holding a double-bladed staff sword Angela smiles
and then continues to fight

Saphira drops down and crashes into a few Urgals and then
lands beside Eragon

Eragon climbs onto Saphira and they take off again flying
high into the air a flock of ARROWS follow them

Arya is surrounded by hundreds of Urgal’s and Kull She
continues to fight but looks tired

Suddenly Saphira lands beside Arya crushing five Urgal’s

ERAGON

Arya turns and jumps onto Saphira

Suddenly a Kull’s axe hits Saphira’s chest armor denting it
inward Saphira grows loudly and grabs the Kull in her mouth
crushing him

Saphira jumps into the air

ERAGON (VO)
Are you alright

SAPHIRA

Saphira soars through the air for a moment and then dives
down and flies through two large DOORS revealing Tronjheim

her implanted into the walls is pure SAPPHIRE sparkling

Zar’roc

Suddenly behind him Tronjheims floor begins to crack
Eragon stops and turns around

An AXE bust through the surface of Tronjheims floor The
sound of Urgal’s can be heard
