Millers Crossing
An Original Screenplay By
Joel Coen
and

Ethan Coen

1 FADE IN
CLOSE SHOT A WHISKEY TUMBLER

That sits on an oak side bar under a glowing green bankers
lamp as two ice cubes are dropped in From elsewhere in
the room

Man (off)
Im talkin about friendship Im talkin about
character Im talkin about--hell Leo I aint
embarassed to use the word--Im talkin about
ethics

Whiskey is poured into the tumbler filling it almost to
the rim as the offscreen man continues

You know Im a sporting man I like to
make the occasional bet But I aint that
sporting

THE SPEAKER

A balding middle-aged man with a round open face He
still wears his overcoat and sits in a leather chair in the
dark room illuminated by the offscreen glow of a desk
lamp This is Johnny Caspar

Behind him stands another man harder looking wearing an
overcoat and hat and holding another hat--presumably
Caspars This is Bluepoiont Vance

Caspar (contd)

When I fix a fight say--if I pay a three-to-one
favorite to throw a goddamn fight--I figure I got
a right to expect that fight to go off at three-
to-one But every time I lay a bet with this
sonofabitch Bernie Bernheim before I know it the
odds is even up--or worse Im betting the short
money

Behind Caspar we hear the clink of ice in the tumbler and a
figure emerges from the shadows walking away from the
glowing bar in the backgound

The sheeny knows I like sure things Hes
selling the information I fixed the fight Out-
of-town money comes pourin in The odds go
straight to hell I dont know who hes sellin
it to maybe the Los Angeles combine I dont
know The point is Bernie aint satisfied with
the honest dollar he can make off the vig He
aint satisfied with the business I do on his
book Hes sellin tips on how I bet and that
means part of the payoff that should be ridin on

my hip is ridin on someone elses So back we
go to these questions--friendship character
ethics

The man with the whiskey glass has just passed the camera
and we cut to the

REVERSE

Another well dressed middle aged man behind a large
polished oak desk listening intently This is Leo He is
short but powerfully built with the face of a man who has
seen things

The man with the whiskey enters frame and passes Leo to
lean against the wall behind him where he listens quietly

Caspar
So its clear what Im sayin
Leo
Clear as mud

Caspar purses his lips but continues unfazed

Caspar
Its a wrong situation Its gettin soa
businessman cant expect no return from a fixed
fight Now if you cant trust a fix what can
you trust For a good return you gotta go
bettin on chance and then youre back with
anarchy Right back inna jungle On account of
the breakdown of ethics Thats why ethics is
important Its the grease makes us get along
what separates us from the animals beasts a
burden beasts a prey Ethics Whereas Bernie
Bernheim is a horse of a different color ethics-
wise As in he aint got any Hes stealin
from me plain and simple

Leo leans back in his chair

The man behind Leo raises the whiskey glass to his lips

He is trimmer and younger than Leo perhaps in his thir-

ties dark-complected with a pencil mustache and a gaunt
intensity that is not entirely healthy-looking This is

Tom

As he drinks he studies Caspar and Bluepoint

Leo
You sure its Bernie selling you out

For the first time the man behind Caspar speaks

Bluepoint
It aint elves

Leo
Nobody else knows about the fix

Caspar
No one that aint got ethics

Leo
What about the fighters you pay to tank out

Bluepoint
We only pick fighters we can put the fear of God
in
Leo
Any other bookies know You play anyone elses
book

Caspar
I lay an occasional bet with Mink Larouie

Bluepoint
But it aint Mink Ill vouch for that

Leo
How do you know

Caspar shakes his head

Caspar
It aint Mink Mink is Bluepoints boy

Leo
Mm And of course Bluepoint always knows about
the fix

Bluepoint

What the hell is that supposed to mean

Leo
Let it drift All it means is a lot of people
know

Caspar

I guess you aint been listening Sure other
people know Thats why we gotta go to this
question of character determine just who exactly
is chiseling in an my fix And thats how we
know its Bernie Bernheim The Motzah Kid
Cause ethically hes kinda shaky

Leo
You know Bernies chiseling you because hes a
chiseler And you know hes a chiseler because
hes chiseling you

Airily

Caspar
Sometimes you just know

Leo
So you wanna kill him

Bluepoint
For starters
Leo nods thinking He swivels to look interrogatively at
Tom

Tom gives an almost imperceptable shrug The ice cubes in
his glass clink

Leo turns back to Caspar pauses

Leo
Sorry Caspar Bernie pays me for protec-
tion

Tom peering over his drink does not entirely conceal his
surprise

Caspar stares at Leo his mouth open It is not the
response he expected

Caspar
Listen Leo I aint askin for permission
Im tellin you as a courtesy I need to do this
thing so its gonna get done

Leo
Then Im telling you as a courtesy that youll
have trouble You came here to see if Id kick
if you killed Bernie Well theres your answer

Caspars voice is harder

Caspar
Listen Leo I pay off to you every month like a
greengrocer--a lot more than the Motzah--and Im
sick a gettin the high hat--

Leo
You pay off for protection just like everyone
else Far as I know--and what I dont know in
this town aint worth knowing--the cops havent
closed any of your dives and the OA hasnt
touched any of your rackets You havent bought
any license to kill bookies and today I aint
selling any Now take your flunky and dangle

Caspar is staring at Leo He looks at Tom then rises
slowly to his feet Back at Leo

Caspar
Ya know Im tryin Im tryin not to raise my
voice in anga Ive always gone along to get
along But you make me lay off the Matzoh and
youre givin me the needle I told you the
sheeny was robbin me blind I told you I wanna
put him in the ground and Im telling you now Im
sick a the high hat

He swipes his hat from Bluepoint

You think Im some guinea fresh off the
boat and you think you can kick me But Im too
big for that now

He puts his hands on the desk and leans towards Leo
The cords stand out on his ndck

Im sick-of takin the strap from you Leo Im
sick a marchin down to this goddamn office to
kiss your Irish ass and IM SICK A THE HIGH HAT

Caspar stops out of breath He is red faced and panting
Bluepoint has put a gently restraining hand an his shoul-
der

Leo and Tom stare at Caspar impasssively
After a beat Caspar shuts his mouth His eyes lose some of

their glaze He looks at Bluepoints hand turns and
strides towards the door

Caspar
Youse fuckin fancy-pants all of ya

He opens the docr but Leos voice stops him
Leo
(softly)
Johnny Youre exactly as big as I let you be

and no bigger and dont forget it Ever

Caspar looks at Lea from the open doorway After a beat he
chuckles

Caspar
Ats right Leo youre the big-shot around here

He dances over at Tom again then back to Leo

And Im just some schnook likes to get
slapped around
He leaves Bluepoint following shutting the door

After a beat Tom crosses in front of the desk and sits down
in the chair Caspar has just vacated Leo chuckles and
leans back in his chair

Leo
Twist a pigs ear Watch him squeal

Tom swallows the last of his drink and stares ruminatively
down at his glass

Tom
Bad play Leo

Leo unfazed grins at Tom

Leo
Got up on the wrong side huh

Tom
Same side as always

Leo
Thats what I mean Still owe money to--whos
your bookie Lazarre

rom

Leo

I could put it right for you
Tom

Thanxs Leo I dont need it

Leo
In a pigs eye You havent played a winner in
six weeks Peoplell speak ill of me if I let
him break your legs

Tom grins back for the first time

Tom
Peoplell say I had it coming

Leo
And theyll be right but that aint the point
Call me a big-hearted slob but Im gonna square
it for ya

He picks up a phone on his desk and starts to dial
Yeah I think Ill do that this very same
night Looking at you moping around takes away
all my What did you call it Joy de veever

Tom stands and walks over to the desk

Tom
Joi de vivre

He takes the receiver from Leo and prongs the phone
Leo
Well look if your gonna laugh at me the hell
with you
Tom walks to the door putting an his hat
Tom
And with you Ill square myself with Lazarre if
you dont mind Thats why God invented cards
He pauses in the doorway and turns back to Leo

There is something you can do for me

Leo
Name it

Tom
Think about what protecting Bernie gets us
Think about what offending Caspar loses us

Leo chuckles good-naturedly

Leo
Come on Tommy you know I dont like to think

Tom has stepped into the hallway and just as he closes the
door

Tom
Yeah Well think about whether you should start

The door clicks shut

CUT TO BLACK

FADE IN
THE WOODS CREDIT SEQUENCE
Although it is day the tree cover gives an effect of
almost cathedral-like darkness The sun filters down
through the leaves in gently shifting patterns

We hear only the sound of the wind and the creaking and
groaning of tree limbs in the breeze

Head titles are supered over the dissolving series of woods
scenes

In the last woods scene the angle is low--almost ground-
level The sun dapples the floor of the forest which is
carpeted with pine needles

With a whoosh of rustling leaves the wind gusts a fedora
into frame For a moment it lies still in the foreground
sunlight rippling over it making it seem almost alive
Then the wind picks up again and the hat tumbles away from
us end over end in slow motion into the background
impossibly far away until it dissappears

As we fade out we hear a distant knocking

FADE IN

CLOSE SHOT TOM

Unshaven eyes closed motionless

The head credits continue over this one-shot scene

The knocking continues faintly offscreen As we hear a
door opening we pull back to a looser shot revealing that
Tom is slumped back on a tired green sofa

A fat hand enters to shake Toms shoulder

Voice
Wake up Tommy

Without ocening his eyes

Tom
Im awake

Voice
Youre eyes were shut

Tom
Whore you gonna believe
Tom sits up though it seems like an effort He looks
sick

From a small mirror behind the couch we see that we are in
the back room of a gambling establishment The leavings of
a card game litter a table in the middle background

Tom
Howd I do

Voice
What do you think Youre a millionaire You
gonna remember your friends

Tom reaches up to feel his head and looks stupidly about

Tom
Wheres my hat

Voice
You bet it ya moron Good thing the game broke
up before you bet your shorts

After a beat of staring at nothing in particular Tom
abruptly lurches to his feet and staggers out of frame

The other man sits heavily onto the couch that Tom has just
vacated He is Fat Tony a big man wearing an apron

He watches as we hear Tom offscreen staggering across the
room bumping into something which scrapes and then
clatters over opening a door staggering across tile and
then vomiting

Fat Tony watches with mild interest

Finally

Toms Voice
Who left with my hat

Tony
Verna Verna and Mink

Tom

Louder

Tony
Mink and Verna
Offscreen we hear a tap running

-

Tony inspects a hangnail on his thumb

Tony

CUT TO
A HALLWAY

A loose shot looking
partment door Head

The door swings open
looking woman in her
coldly out at Tom

over Toms shoulder as he knocks on an
credits continue

and Verna an attractive but hard-
late twenties or early thirties looks

Tom

(still slightly woozy)

Miss me
Verna
You again What now

Tom
I want my hat

Verna
Is that all you came for

Tom
Yeah I want my hat

Verna
I won it Its mine

Tom
Whatre you gonna do with it

Verna
Drop dead

She slams the door

There is a long motionless beat Tom raises his hand and
knocks again missing the door completely on his first try

After a knock or two the door swings open again

Tom
I need a drink

Verna
Why didnt you say so

She steps away from the door and Tom enters the apartment
As the door clicks shut we cut to black and the last of
the movies head credits

Music clays under the credits mixed in with the woods
sounds we heard earlier As the last of the credits is
fading to black we hear a distant knocking and from black
we

cut To
CLOSE SHOT A FEDORA

Lying on a marble bureau top in a dark room A gently
rippling cookie plays over it--light from a streetlamp
thrown through a curtained window Reflected in the bureau
mirror behind the fedora we see the soft glow of a burning

cigarette

REVERSE

Tracking in on Tom sitting in bed smoking staring at the
bureau The rippling street light plays over him from the

window We hear a distant knocking

WIDER

The bedroom as Tom swings his legs around and gets out of
bed

Tom throws on a dressing gown and leaves the bedroom
through its double oak pocket doors closing the doors
behind him

LIVING ROOM

Also dark lit only by streetlight filtering in

The knocking is louder here Tom crosses the room
silhouetted against the windows to the apartments front

door Light fans in as he opens it

Shiftng uncomfortably in the hallway is Leo in an
overcoat and fedora

Leo
Lo Tommy Sorry about the hour

Tom
Ill live Whats the rumpus

Leo
Can i come in

Tom thinks about this for the slightest beat

Tom
Sure

He lets Leo precede him into the living room
Tom turns on a lamp that sits on a rolling bar

Drink
Leo
I wouldnt mind I tried calling earlier

Tom
I got home late

As Tom sits down facing Leo with two drinks

Leo
Well Sorry about the hour

Tom
Uh-huh

He waits with no apparent impatience

The older man is uncomfortable he is having trouble
finding the words Finally he lifts his glass and swallows
it in one gulp

Leo

Not bad
Tom

Better than the paint we sell at the club

Leo
That it is That it is

fq

rom
Thought about cutting Bernie loose

Leo is shuffling his hat nervously from hand to hand

Leo
Cant do it Tommy cant do it Thats sort
of why Im Tommy I dont know where

Verna is

Tom fixes him with a level stare then takes a sip of his
drink

Tom
Uh-huh

Leo
I know what youre thinking What else is new
But the situation now Im worried

Tom blows out air

Tom
Verna can take care of herself Maybe better
than you can

Leo
What does that mean

Tom stands up takes Leos glass and walks back over to the
bar

Tom
Want another

Leo
No What does that mean

Tom turns to look at Leo pauses then decides to speak

Tom
How far has she got her hooks into you

Leo
Thats a hell of a question

Tom
Its a grift Leo If she didnt need you to
protect her brother from Johnny Caspar dyou
think shed still go with you on slow carriage
rides through the park That is the deal isnt
it You keep Bernie under wraps till Caspar
cools down

Leo
Jesus but youre a prickly pear Whats wrong
with her wanting her brother taken care of

Tom
Not a thing I dont blame her She sees the
angle--which is you--and she plays it Shes a
grifter just like her brother They probably
had grifter parents and grifter grandparents and
someday theyll each spawn little grifter kids--

Leo
Stop it Tommy I dont like to hear my friends
run down Even by other friends

Tom shrugs

Tom
Friendships got nothing to do with it

Leo
The hell you say You do anything to help your
friends Just like you do anything to kick your
enemies

Tom
Wrong Leo You do things for a reason

Leo
Okay Tom you know the angles--Christ better
than anybody But youre wrong about this You
dont know whats in Vernas heart

Tom stares down into his drink There is an awkward pause
Then finally without looking up

Tom
Leo throw her down And her brother too Dump
her

Leo looks like he has just been stepped on

Leo
Jesus Tom Vernas okay

He nods to himself

Shes a little wild but shes okay I
like her

Tom smiles
Tom
Yeah you like her Like the Kaiser likes
cabbage Youre dizzy for her
Leo scowls at Tom
Leo
What of it Jesus Tom aint you ever been bit
by that bug
Tom
Leo if shes such an angel why are you looking

for her at four in the morning

Leo digs his hands into his pockets and slouches back
profoundly embarassed

Leo
I put a tail on her this afternoon

Tom
Hah

Leo
Yeah I asked Rug Daniels to follow her around--
just you know just to keep her out of trouble

Tom
And to tell you what trouble she was managing to
whip up herself

Leo
It wasnt to spy Tom I was worried After that
meeting with Caspar well--you cant be too
careful

Tom
Uh-huh And what did Rug tell you that has you
scurrying over here

Leo
Thats just it Nothing Hes disappeared

Tom laughs humorlessly

Tom
So youve lost your ladyfriend and the tail you
put an her

Leo
I guess it does sound pretty sorry at that

He looks from his empty glass up to Tom

Help me out Tom I wouldnt know where to
start looking You know Rugs crowd you know
the people Verna runs with Im just worried
now with things the way they are between me and
Caspar--

Tom gives a wave of disgust

Tom
You shouldnt be confronting Johnny Caspar its
what Ive been trying to tell you You cant
trade body blows with him Hes gotten too
strong

For the first time Leo displays some testiness
Leo

I reckon I can still trade body blows with any
man in this town
He sighs looks back down at his drink
Except you Tom

Tom
And Verna

Leo smiles good-naturedly
Leo
Okay give me the needle I ama sap I deserve
it

He stands and walks to the door

Tom doesnt move His eyes remain fixed on the chair Leo
has just vacated

Leo pauses in the open doorway

Thanks for the drink Let me know if you
hear anything

The door closes and he is gone

Tom grimaces and stands up Sunlight is just starting to
come in through the windows defining for the first time

the corners of the large semi-circular room as Tom walks

across it to the bedroom Distant early-morning traffic

noise is filtering up from the street

INT BEDROOM

As Tom opens the double oak doors and enters leaving them
open

He crosses to the bed and sits an its edge hunched
forward thinking Behind him a woman stirs

Woman
(sleepily)
Who was that

Tom
Leo

He takes a cigarette from the nightstand and lights it

Hes looking for you
Verna stiffens

Verna
Did you tell him I was here

Tom
No

Verna relaxes

Verna
Did you put in a good word for my brother

Tom
No

Verna
You said you would

Tom
I said Id think about it

Verna
What did you tell him

Tom is lost in thought He exhales smoke

Tom
Did you see Rug Daniels last night

Verna
No What did you tell Leo

Tom finally turns to face her After looking at her fora
beat

Tom
I told him you were a tramp and he should
dump you
A shoe flies past his head and hits the wall behind him

Verna
Youre a son of a bitch Tom

EXT ALLEYWAY EARLY MORNING

We are on an extreme close shot of a small dog Behind
him in the distance we can see the mouth of the alley
The dog is on point perfectly still one front leg crooked
and raised off the ground his ears pointed straight up
his eyes in a fixed stare

A MAN

is slouched half-sitting against the wall of the alley
He is motionless His mouth is agape His eyes are rolled
up in a lifeless stare

He is wearing an overcoat but it is unbuttoned and reveals
a blood stain in the middle of his chest His fedora lies

on the ground near one of his splayed hands

There is something subtly odd about his hair

CLOSE SHOT A LITTLE BOY

Perhaps five years old He stares down at the dead man in
front of him

CLOSE SHOT THE MAN

Staring vacantly

THE BOY

After a moment he reaches forward

THE MAN

As the boys hand enters frame The boy pokes once at the
mans shoulder

There is no reaction
The boy touches the top of the mans head

The mans hair slips forward a couple of inches over over his
forehead

THE BOY

Staring
THE MAN

Also staring his skewed hairpiece ill becoming his stunned
expression

The boy reaches forward and takes the hairpiece off the
mans head Now a bald man stares off into smace still
looking stunned still quite dead

WIDE SHOT THE ALLEY

The dead man and the little bov face each other in profile
in the middle foreground In the background between them
the little boys dog faces us still on point still
whining

The little boy is fascinated by the hairpiece he holds He
turns it over and around and looks from it to the dead
man

Suddenly the boy turns and runs away from us towards the
mouth of the alley still clutching the hairpiece

As he passes the dog it turns and runs after him wagging
its tail happy to be leaving

FADE OUT

FADE IN
INT DINER EVENING

A man sits facing us at the counter in the foreground His
face is hidden by the newspaper he is reading

The page of the newspaper being presented to the camera
bears a story headlined GANGSTER SLAIN The subhead
Politicians Aide Found Dead in Alley

After a beat the diner drops the paper to the counter and
we see that it is Tom wearing overcoat and hat He is
grimacing at whatever he was reading He stands and digs
into his pocket

REVERSE

Looking down at the newspaper an the counter next to a
steaming cup of coffee Toms hand enters to put some
change on the counter leaves and we hear his receding
footsteps

The headlined story on the page Tom was reading is
THUNDERCLAP INJURED IN RACING MISHAP

Tom

Her arm sweeps across frame to slap Tom hard

Check Girl (off)
Aint you got a conscience

Tom stares dumbly

ON BERYL

A diminutive woman in a french maids uniform with a pill
box hat She rocks her weight on one leg with her hands
proceed defiantly on her hips

look at Mink with mild curiosity

Tom

Tom

Mink

Tom

Mink

He sics on his cigarette and looks nervously around the
floor then back at Tom who stares coolly back

Tom
Youre a fickle boy Mink If Bluepoint found
out you had another amigo--well I dont peg
him for the understanding type

Mink is startled In a high shrill voice as Tom walks up
the stairs clutching his drink

Mink
Find out How would he find out Damnit Tom

damnit Jesus

13 INT LEOS OFFICE
Pulling Tom as he enters the office
Leo (off)

Lo Tom You know OGar
REVERSE
Leo faces us from behind his desk
Seated in two chairs facing the desk twisting around to
greet Tom are two men OGar is a large man wearing a
police uniform Dale Levander wears a suit a florid man

with a shock of white hair in his mid-sixties

Leo
and the mayor

Tom
I ought to I voted for him six times last May

Levander chuckles

Levander
And that aint the record either

Tom is crossing to the bar

Leo
Verna turned up Shes downstairs

Tom his back to Leo as he pours a drink stiffens

Tom
She say where shed been

Leo
No I uh didnt want to press her Hear
about Rug

Drink in hand Tom turns and crosses to perch an a corner
of Leos desk

Yeah RIP

Leo
They took his hair Tommy Jesus thats strange
Why would they do that

Tom
Maybe it was Injuns

Leo
Eye-ties more like it Giovanni Casparro

fq

om
So you figure it was Caspar bumped Rug

Leo with a puzzled smile glances at OGar and the mayor
and then back at Tom

Leo
Well its pretty obvious aint it

Tom
Mm So whats the plan

Leo
Jump on the guinea hard With both feet

He looks at the mayor who shifts uncomfortably in his seat
Give him the low-down Dale
Mayor
Yes well Leo here has just reminded us that
Mr Caspar operates several clubs in our city
wherein the patrons imbibe of rum and play at
games of chance

Morosely

OGar
And were sunnosed to stop the party

Tom
Uh-huh
Looking at Leo he jerks his head towards the two men
They dont seem too happy about it Leo

OGar
Naw it aint that Tom

Mayor
Jesus Tom We do as were told

Tom ignores them

Tom
Maybe theyre right not to like it Stirring up
this hornets nest wont be good for anyone And
itll mean killing

Leo
Well Im not thrilled about it either but I
cant just lay down to Caspar

Tom
You could do worse You might not like it but
giving up Bernie Bernheim is a pretty small price
to pay for peace Business is business and a
wars going to hurt everybody Bernie plays with
fire hes got to deal with the consequences--
even if that means he gets bumped off

Leo
Sweet Jesus Tom that aint even the point
anymore Caspar pooped Rug The day I back down
from a fight Caspar is welcome to the rackets
this town and my place at the table I didnt
start this thing but--

Toms voice is sharp

Tom
You did start it--you and Verna--

The mayor has risen to his feet Uncomfortably

Mayor
We can dangle Leo if youd prefer

Leo
Siddown Dale were all friends here

Tom
--and Caspar hasnt broken the rules Bernie has-—
-and you too by helping him And if that isnt
enough consider that if you make it a war you
have more to lose than Caspar

Leo is getting up from behind the desk and walking over to
stare out the window

Leo
Okay but more to beat him with Jesus Tom the
two of usve faced worse odds

Tom
But never without reason It helps to have one

Leo doesnt reply Tom is irritated but shrugs indif-
ference

Well its your call
He gets to his feet and starts for the door

My opinion use to count for something
around here but its always yours to take or
leave

Leo has turned from the window and is striding after Tom
gesturing appologetically

Leo
Aw cmon Tommy Its not like that

The door clicks shut

Goddamnit Goddamn kid is just like a
twist

14 CUT TO
FAT TONY

Tending the downstairs bar as Tom stalks over
Tom

Gimme a stiff one
Tony

Tony has finished pouring a shot of whiskey which Tom
immediately knocks bac

om
If theres any justice Verna around

Tony
She stepped into the ladies room You got
Lazarres five hundred

Tom

Tom is pouring himself another drink

Tony

Tom is irritated

Tom

Tony
I admire a man of principle Does this go on the
tab

Drink in hand Tom is already walking away

15 INT LADIES LOUNGE

As Tom bangs through the door still carelessly holding his
tumbler of whiskey A rogue lock of hair hangs down over
his forehead

Tom
Close your eyes ladies Im coming through

REVERSE

The hubbub of female voices evaporates as all turn to look
at the male intruder

The lounges decor is done in various shades of pink Some
of the women apply make-up facing the large bulb-encircled
mirrors on overstuffed seashell shaped pink chairs Other
women sit smoking in the banquettes that line the other
wall

All react to Toms entrance with surprise mixed with
various degrees of outrage and they hurry to gather their
things and leave The one exception is Verna who looks at
Tom with unperturbed distaste
As he crosses to her seashell chair

Tom
Whos the warpaint for

Verna
Go home and dry out

Tom
You dont need it for Leo believe me He
already thinks youre the original Miss Jesus

She glances hurriedly around the lounge but the last of
the women are already leaving

Verna
What the hells the matter with you

Tom
Whats the matter with you Afraid people might
get the right idea
Verna studies him for a beat
Verna
Leos got the right idea I like him hes
honest and hes got a heart

Tom weaves a couple of steps closer to her

Tom
Then its true what they say Opposites attract

Verna
Do me a favor and mind your own business

She turns back to the mirror and starts applying her
lipstick Tom drops down to face her in the mirror

Tom
This is my business Intimidating helpless women is

part of what I do

Verna
Then find one and intimidate her

Tom swallows the rest of his drink in one gulp

Tom
Leos upstairs getting ready to shoot himself in
the foot on your account

Verna
I dont know what youre talking about

Tom
Hes gonna go to the mat for your brother And
its gonna hurt him

Verna
I dont know Leos business but hes a big boy

Tom
He used to be

Verna causes with the lipstick She looks at Tom intently
but her tone softens

Verna
Look What do you want Tom You want me to
pretend I dont care what happens to Bernie
Well I do Hes my brother and I dont want him
to get hurt If Leo wants to help him out Ill
step out with him show him a good time in
return Theres no harm in that

Tom
Theres a name for that kind of business arrange-
ment

Verna

Ill do what I have to for Bernie and theres no
reason for you to try and queer that Regardless
of what you think of me Bernies a decent guy

Tom
A straight shooter huh A square gee

Verna
Yeah sneer at him like everyone else Just
because hes different People think hes a
degenerate People think hes scum Well hes
not

Tom
Poor misunderstood Bernie

Verna swivels around to stare quizzically at Tom
Verna

What is this about You want me to stop
seeing Leo Why dont you just say so
Tom
want you to quit spinning Leo in circles and
pointing him where to go

Verna
forgot--thats your job isnt it

Tom
ll do what I have to to protect Leo Im
asking you--politely for me--to leave him alone
dont have to ask If I told him about our
little dance last night your pull would dry up
pretty fast

Now Verna is irritated

Verna
So would yours I dont like being threatened

Tom
I dont like being played for a sucker That
game might work with Leo but it wont work with
me

Verna
You think last night was just more campaigning
for my brother

Tom
I can see the angles

He grabs her by the arm and drags her roughly to her feet

And I know if there was a market for little
old ladies youd have Grandma Bernheim first on
line

Verna
(struggling to get out of his grasp)
Youre a pathetic rumhead

Tom
And I love you Angel

Tom takes her hat off tosses it onto the chair and kisses
her roughly on the lips

Verna breaks away and socks him on the jaw Tom staggers
back upsetting a table of toiletries and landing against a
banquette

He throws his empty whiskey glass at Verna
She ducks and it smashes into the mirror

They stand staring at each other for a beat breathing
hard Tom has a smear of lipstick near one side of his
mouth

Finally

Verna
I suppose you think youve raised hell

She picks up her stole and heads for the door
Tom stands staring at her back swaying ever so slightly

Tom
Sister when Tve raised hell youll know it

CUT TO
INT TOMS APARTMENT

A wide shot facing the semi-circular windows the door of
the apartment behind us A large easy chair in the middle
foreground faces away from us a smaller chair is at the
window end of the room facing us

At the cut we hear the ringing of the telephone

Offscreen we can hear the unhurried scrape of a key in the
lock then the door opening then the door closing

Toms back enters frame as he strolls into the room and
then disappears briefly through an open doorway to the
right We hear an icebox door opening and closing and
then Tom reenters again still not reacting to the insis-
tently ringing phone He is now holding a balled-up towel

He walks over to the facing chair at the window end of the
room shrugs off his overcoat drapes it on the chair
sits crosses his legs takes off his hat tosses it onto
the upraised toes of his crossed leg tilts his head back
and presses the towel against his forehead--apparently it
is an icepack

We are beginning to track slowly towards him

After a beat he takes out a cigarette lights it and
reaches back for the phone that refuses to stop ringing
Tom
Yeah

He casually looks forward just off to one side at a
specific point in space He does not react to whatever he
is hearing

I need a couple days Because I dont
have it now

We are almost in close shot now His gaze is still fixed
and emotionless

Because I say so What would be good
enough Well if itll make him feel any
better tell Lazarre he can send someone by to
break my legs I wont squawk

He prongs the earpiece still looking off The track has
stopped in close shot He exhales a stream of smoke then
after a beat

Lo Bernie

REVERSE

Slouched in a chair in the corner of the room facing Tom
is Bernie Bernheim He is about thirty and wears his
overcoat and hat and a good-natured smile He holds an
apple in one hand and a paring knife in the other The
long peel of the apple corkscrews down off the knife

Bernie
Lo Tom Whats the rumpus

Tom
Cmon in make yourself at home

Bernie
Yeah you werent here so I thought Id do that
Didnt wanna answer the phone though Figured
it wasnt for me

Tom
Uh-huh

After a silent beat Bernie chuckles

Bernie
I get it get to the point huh Okay
The point is Im a good guy

Tom
Ive heard that from a lot of people today

Bernie slices off an apple section and holds it out to Tom
who shakes his head

Bernie
Good guy lot of friends--thats the way it
works Maybe if you appreciated me a little
more you wouldnt be making waves with Leo

He pops the slice in his mouth

ts a bad time to be doing that I mean right
now were both in a jam I hear youre on a bad
streak short of funds and Ive got that
psychotic guinea mad at me Dont ask me why
m just a small-timer trying to get by like
everyone else I need help from my friends
Like Leo And you

Tom
Leo gets your sister whatre you selling me

Bernie
Cmon Tom its not like that at all Wasnt
my idea Shell sleep with anyone you know
that Shes even tried to teach me a thing or
two about bed artistry Can you believe that--my
own sister Some crackpot idea about saving me
from my friends

Bernie laughs pleasantly

Shes a sick twist all right I guess some
guys like that

Tom
She speaks highly of you

Bernie shrugs

Bernie
Yeah well you stick by your family The point
is I can help you with your debts if that would
make us friends My motto is a guy cant have
too many Big payday Saturday Tom You could
be in on it

For the first time Tom is interested

Tom
Another fix Which fight

Bernie
Well thats confidential at the moment But it
doesnt have to stay that way
Tom gives Bernie a speculative eye
Tom
How dyou know about it Caspar isnt laying any

more bets with you

Bernie
Mm

Tom gives a humorless smile
Tom
You must really have Mink jumping through

hoops

Bernie is getting to his feet wiping the knife blade on his
coat

Bernie
Like I say you cant have too many

He pauses at the open door looks up and down the hall and
turns to look at Tom

We got a deal

Tom
Ill think about it

On his way out

Bernie
I wouldnt want it any other way

On the click of the door latch we cut to

STREET DAY
Pulling Tom along the sidewalk

Tom
Cud
He is calling out to a short rail-like man lounging against
a building who joins him as he walks Cud has small sharp
features except for one cheek which is hugely distended by
a wad of chewing tobacco

My credit still good with you

Cud gives a so-so flutter of his hand

Give me a hundred across on Tailor Maid in
the third tonight

Cud shakes his head

Cud
Lazarre wont like it

Tom
Try fifty across
Cud shrugs
Cud
Tll try Thatll make another one-fifty you owe
him
Tom

Only if I lose Cud

Cud
Tommy the way youre goin--horses got knees

Tom
I dunno Fetlocks

Cud
Well the way youre goin if I was a horse Id
be down on my fetlocks prayin you dont bet on
me

Another man a huge man has walked up to flank Toms other
side This is Frankie

Frankie
Drift small guy

Cud
Drop dead ape

Frankie

Cmon Tom my boss wants to see you He didnt

have time to engrave nothin formal
Cud starts to fade away

Cud
Ill see you later Tommy I gotta go spit

INT ROOM

It is a large room with a couple of card tables straight-
backed chairs a ratty sofa--a sparsely furnished card room
off the main floor of a club

At the cut we are tracking behind Tom into the room as
Frankie and Tic-Tac a small ferret-faced-man escort him
in We hear a womans voice speaking rapid-fire Italian

Bluepoint is sitting on the couch wearing his overcoat and
his hat pushed back an his forehead

Sitting at one of the card tables is Caspar With him is
his wife a short very round Italian woman and his son
Johnny Jr Johnny Jr about five years old is also very
round He wears a suit with short pants that reveal
dimpled knees

Bluepoint an the couch is watching the domestic scene
without any particular warmth

Caspar
Whaddya mean hes eatin too much Whadduz the
goddamn doctor know
He turns to the little boy

What you eat for lunch

Johnny Jr
A hot dog

Caspar
Just a hot dog

The boy shakes his head

Johnny Jr
A hot dog and mustard

Caspar throws his head back and roars with laughter
Caspar
A hot dog with mustard A hot dog with mustard
You hear that Bluepoint The kids as smart as a
whip Even Uncle Bluepoint thinks thats funny
Bluenpoints face is a solem mask
Whadduz the goddamn doctor know
Caspar wipes away tears of mirth and digs in his pocket
with his left hand Extending two closed fists towards the
boy
Ghead which hand is the penny in
The boy touches his right fist
Choose again

The boy just looks at him

Okay here ya go Take the penny Shiny
new penny

To his wife

Take the kid Wait in the car Givem
a penny boys

Tic-Tac and Frankie dig in their pockets for change as the
boy and his mother cross to the door

Frankie
I aint got a penny boss

Caspar has turned his attention to a check book that lies
on the table in front of him As he writes

Caspar
Ah well thats a penny ya owe him Lo Tom
whats the rumpus You like kids

Tom
No

Absently

Caspar
Uh-huh Have a seat Gahead

He tears out the check
Well youre missin out on a complete
life I know kids big deal but still Im
tellin ya

He blows on the check

Anyway Thanks for comin by I just
wrote this check out to your bookmaker Lazarre
Its for an even fifteen hundred which is more
than I hear you owe him but I figure you can

such as yaself whaddya say

Tom

Caspar laughs

Caspar

You wanna know why Im putting you square with
Lazarre

Tom
Not particularly

Caspar
Bad feeling It aint a good thing Its a
poison kid I want everybody to be friends I
do this youre friends with Lazarre hes
friends with you and youre friends with me
And all you gotta do show youre a friend is to

Motzah steals from me I cant have Leo givin

make Leo understand that

Tom
So the deal is I give you the Motzah smooth it
over with Leo and you bail me out with Lazarre

Caspar

Bluepoint sneers from the couch

Bluepoint
We can maybe have tea sometime
Caspar
Cmon Bluepoint Friends is a mental state

Tom
Ill think about it

Caspar
Hell think about it Hear that Bluepoint
Thats terrific The kids a thinker

Bluepoint
Does he want a pillow for his head

Caspar
Okay kid think about it Its a mental state
But make it quick my familys waitin

Tom
Ill think about it and tell you later

Bluepoint
He needs to think in the thinking room

Caspar shakes his head sadly

Caspar
Kid if itll help you think you should know
that if you dont do this you wont be in any
shape to walk outa here

Tom considers this

Tom
Would that be physically or just a mental
state

Caspar stares at him for a beat then slowly starts to tear
up the check

Caspar
That aint friendly kid I make you a
nice offer I get the high hat

He gets up and walks over to the door Tic-Tac opens it
for him and precedes him out

Before following Caspar out the door Bluepoint grins at
Tom

Bluepoint
Too bad for you smart guy
He leaves shutting the door
The room is quiet
Tom looks at Frankie the large man who looks back

Frankie stands takes off his suit coat and hangs it
carefully on a rack by the door

He approaches Tom

Tom
Hold it

Frankie complies Tom is standing and shrugging off his
coat He folds it neatly and turns to lay it on the chair
he was in

When he turns around again he is holding the chair and he
smashes it into Frankies face

Frankie staggers back but doesnt drop He reaches up to
his nose and his hand comes away bloody

Frankie
Jesus Tom

Tom still holds the chair

Frankie looks at him for a moment then walks over to the
door opens it and leaves shutting it behind him

The room is very quiet Tom stands facing the door still
holding the chair After a beat or two he starts to put
it down

The door opens and he quickly raises the chair again
Tic-Tac the little man with the hawk nose is striding

into the room briskly approaching Tom Frankie the
gorilla follows cautiously

Tic-Tac blocks Tons swing of the chair with his forearm
wraps both arms around it and pulls it awav from Tom As
Frankie circles Tom Tic-Tac tosses the chair across the
room

Frankie now behind Tom wallops him in the small of the
back The blow sends him staggering towards Tic-Tac who
cracks him in the jaw

Frankie grabs Toms hair and yanks his head back as Tic-Tac
works on his midsection Toms hands are reaching back to
grope for Frankie

Still holding his hair with one hand Frankie cuffs Tom
awkwardly on the side of the head Tom staggers around and
Tic-Tac now behind him also hits him on the side of the
head

Tom goes down His head hits the floor with a thunk

We are on a low angle an the floor Behind Toms head in
the background we see the door to the room

The door splinters in with a loud crash

Frankies feet are walking up alongside Toms head as blue
uniforms stream into the room

Frankie
Just in the nick of time huh

He brings his foot back to deliver a walloping kick to the
back of Toms head On the impact we cut to

BLACK

Over black we hear the sound of running water

FADE IN
TOM

Gasping for air as his head is pulled out from under a
running faucet

The uniformed policeman who was holding him there and is
now pulling him back up grins at him

Cop
No harm done Unless your friend broke his foot

Tom is still woozy

Tom
Wuzzit How long What day is it

Cop
Friday 12th of September 1929 Same as when
you left us about ten seconds ago

He is leading Tom by the arm out of the cramped bathroom
back into the card room where he was beat up Another cop
has Frankie cuffed in a straightbacked chair and is taking
roundhouse swings at him He pauses breathing heavily

Second Cop
Lo Tom Care to skin a knuckle an your
playmate here

Tom
No thanks Delahanty

As Tom and the first cop leave the card room
Second Cop
Well if you change your mind well be inter-
rogatin for a while

Tom and his escort are emerging onto the casino floor

First Cop
What was that party about anyway

Tom
We do this every weekend

Blue uniforms are everywhere Some are escorting tuxedoed
patrons and employees to the exit some wield axes on the
gaming equipment others are using nightsticks to smash the
bottles behind the bar Tom winces at this and lights a
cigarette

Tom
Jesus

He takes a battle and glass from a table as they walk by

What the hell is the matter with you

people

First Cop
Well they said make it hurt So we make it
hurt

EXT THE BUILDING

We see that the buildings facade claims to be SABBATINIS
ANTIQUES AND COLLECTIBLES

Tom weaves across the street with his battle and glass
towards OGar the police chief leaning against a squad
car chewing a toothpick He is watching morosely as his
men load other men into paddywagons the street is clogged
with police vehicles

Tom
Drink OGar

OGar does not bother to look at Tom as they talk he is
unhappily watching the spectacle

OGar
Im an duty

Tom pours himself a glass

Tom
To Volstead

He tosses back a shot
Any news on Rug

OGar
Still dead far as I know

Tom
Get a slug out of him

OGar
Yeah a 22 Listen Tom Im just the chief
around here so dont bother telling me if you
dont happen to feel like it but what the hell
is Leo doing

Tom
Ours is not to reason why friend

OGar
Balls Look at this mess Make him listen to
you Tom It aint right all this fuss over one
sheeny Let Caspar have Bernie--Jesus whats
one Hebrew more or less

He nods at the building
Were burning our mealticket here
Tom
Leo1ll do what suits him and youll do what he
tells you Last I heard Leos still running this

town

OGar

He wont be for long if this keeps up Its no
good for anyone--you said as much yourself

Tom
First off OGar I can say what I please to Leo
and about him

He taps him on the chest
You cant Second once Leo decides--
thats that And if that sticks going down
there are plenty of other coppers wouldnt mind

being chief and could swallow it clean

OGar looks chastened

OGar
Jesus Tom I was just speculatin about a
hypothesis I know I dont know nothin Its

just a damn mess is all--

He is interrupted by gunfire from an upper story of the
facing building

OGars men react finding cover returning the fire

OGar unholsters his gun as he and Tom scramble for cover

a goddamn mess

HALLWAY

We are shooting over Toms shoulder as he knocks at the
door to Vernas apartment

After a beat Verna opens the door
On seeing who it is she starts to swing the door shut
Tom puts his toe in the doorway and leans into the door
As he pushes his way in
Tom
Thanks dont mind if I do
INT APARTMENT

As Verna gives up and Tom enters
Verna walks over to the phone As she dials Tom tosses
his hat onto a chair and checks the apartment to see if
theyre alone

Verna
Hello officer Id like to report an intruder at
346 West--

Tom grabs the phone away from her

Tom
Whos this Lo Shad Tom Duchaisne here
We wont be needing any today Thats right

my mother She didnt recognize me Lemme talk
to Mulvaney

He takes a flask out of his packet and looks across the
room towards Verna

Miss me

Verna
Drop dead

We hear a voice barking through the line and Tom turns back
to the phone

Tom
Lo Sean tell OCar to send a car over to
Leos tonight If were going to be banging away
at Caspar we ought to be ready for him to bang
back Yeah

He hangs up the phone and tips the flask back draining the
last drop

Verna
What do you want

Tom is crossing to the bar
Tom
I was in the neighborhood feeling a little
daffy Thought Id drop in for an apperitif
He pours himself a drink

Rug Daniels is dead

Verna
Gee thats tough
Tom
Dont get hysterical Ive had enough excitement
for one nigit without a dame going all weepy on
me

Verna
I barely knew the gentleman

Tom
Rug Bit of a shakedown artist Not above the
occasional grift but youd understand that All
in all not a bad guy if looks brains and
personality dont count

Verna
You better hope they dont

He gives her a sick grin
Tom

Yeah well were none of us the saint I
hear your brother is

Verna
Who killed him

Tom
Leo thinks Caspar did

Verna
But you know better

Tom
I do now Caspar just tried to buy me into
settling his tiff with Leo which held hardly do
if he was waging war So I figure you killed
him Angel You or Saint Bernard

Verna
Why would I--or my brother--kill Rug Daniels or
anybody else

Tom
Rug was following you He knew about you and me
That wouldnt help your play with Leo would it

He looks at her She holds his gaze
Verna

You think I murdered someone Come on Tom you
know me a little
Tom
Nobody knows anybody--not that well

Verna
You know or you wouldnt be here

Tom
Not at all sugar I came to hear your side of
the story--how horrible Rug was how he goaded
you into it how he tried to shake you down--

Verna
Thats not why you came either

Tom shrugs

Tom
Tell me why I came

Verna looks at him

Verna
The oldest reason there is

Tom
There are friendlier places to drink

Verna
Why cant you admit it

Tom
Admit what

Verna
Admit you dont like me seeing Lee because youre
jealous Admit it isnt all cool calculation
with you--that youve got a heart--even if its
small and feeble and you cant remember the last
time you used it

Tom
If Id known we were going to cast our feelings
into words Id have memorized the Song of
Solomon

Verna smiles

Verna
Maybe thats why I like you Tom Ive
never met anyone made being a sonofabitch such a
point of pride

She turns to walk across the room
Though one day youll pay a crice for it
Tom grabs her wrist

Tom
Okay Verna But until then lets get stinko

He draws her close

Verna
Lets do something else first

She reaches up takes off his hat and tosses it casually
away We pan with the hat to where it lands on the floor
in front of a curtained window

Tom (off)
Yeah Lets do plenty

DISSOLVE THROUGH TO
ANOTHER WINDOW NIGHT

A living room window open its white sheers billowing
lazily in the draft

Faintly from another room in the house we can hear a
phonograph playing John McCormack singing Danny Boy

At the cut we hear a thump close by and briefly the
sounds of a struggle We then hear a breathy gurgling
sound which quickly subsides

The living room is late-night quiet

The shot is a lateral track which brings us off the window
to an end table in the foreground On the end table is a
pouch of Bull Durham a package of rolling papers a cup of
coffee with steaming rising off of it and a section of a
newspaper The draft gently lifts a couple rolling papers
off the table

The continuing track takes us off the end table and
booming down shows us an upset chair and the legs of the
man who occupied it

We track along the mans body to discover that he is face-
down on the section of newspaper he was reading blood

oozing out of his slit throat onto the newspaper

The continuing track shows that between the fingers of one
outflung hand a cigarette burns It is resting on the
newspaper

We see the feet of another man who is turning and walking
away from the man on the floor into the background We
pan over to watch him recede framing out all of the dying
man except his outflung hand and cigarette

As the walking man recedes more and more of his topcoated
body crops in By the time he reaches the houses front
door in the deep background we can see him full figure

The newspaper in the foreground is crackling into flame
The rug it rests on is beginning to smoke and discolor

As the man in the background opens the front door we jump
in
OVER HIS SHOULDER

Waiting in the darkness just outside is another man ina
topcoat and fedora He is holding two tommy guns

The men do not exchange words

The man outside hands his partner a tommy gun and follows
him as he walks back into the house

Still faint we continue to hear Danny Boy We also hear
the lick of flames

A VICTROLA

The song is louder at the cut We are in an upstairs
bedroom

LEO
Stretched out an his bed wearing a robe over his pyjamas

smoking a cigar listening--but only to the phonograph
Its sound covers any other noise in the house

STAIRWAY

A close track on the two pairs of feet climbing the stairs

We see only the feet the swaying hems of the topcoats and
occasionally dipping into frame the muzzles of the two
tommy guns

BEDROOM

Leo is motionless looking down a puzzled expression

HIS POV
The floor

Thin smoke is beginning to sift up through the floorboards

STAIRWAY

Tracking on the approaching feet The song grows louder

BEDROOM

Leo looking slowly taking the cigar from his mouth

BEDROOM DOOR

From inside as--CRASH--it is kicked in

LEO

Hitting the floor and rolling under the bed

THE TWO GUNMEN

Striding into the room

LEO

On his belly under the bed facing the door swinging a
handgun in front of him

HIS POV

From floor level the bottom of the mattress above us the
floorboards stretching away
The bed crops the two gunmen mid-shin as they swing their
guns up firing

RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT--the hems of their coats sway as they fire
The floorboards in front of us are pocked by bullet hits
that walk across the floor towards the bed and hit the

mattress

The mattress above us dances under the gunfire as ticking
sprays down at the floor

Smoke curls up throuch the floorboards

LEO

Jaw clamped on his cigar he starts firing

HIS POV
Blood spurts as one gunman takes a hit in the ankle

He staggers and his tommy gun clatters to the floor

LEO

Still firing

HIS POV
The other gunman is ducking out the door

The injured gunman pitches forward head towards us his
hat rolling off

LEO

Firing

HIS POV

A bullet hit in the top of the fallen mans head

LEO

Rolling out from under the bed

He stoops to pick up the dead mans tommy gun Thick smoke
seeps up through the floor

The phonograph plays

Leo ducks through another door

HALLWAY

Facing down the length of the dark hallway towards the
mouth of the stairs

As Leo leaps across frame in the foreground to enter a
facing room muzzle flashes erupt at the end of the hall--
where the other gunman has been waiting in the darkness

SECOND ROOM

Leo throws open a window

EXT

As Leo rolls out onto the long sloping eave of a front
porch

His gun skates down the eave and falls Leo grabs the rain
gutter hangs by his hands and drops down to the front
lawn

The first floor of the house is in flames
From a high angle the camera swoops down on Leo as he picks
up the gun and backs away from the house looking up at the
second story His open robe flaps in the breeze The dead
cigar is still clamped between his teeth

LEOS POV

The second floor window that he just emerged from
Staccato gunfire erupts in the dark room

The strobing gunfire makes a strobing shadow of the gunman
whose back is to us as he rakes the room with fire

LEO

Firing the gun jumping and bucking in his hands

INSIDE THE ROOM
The gunman riddled with bullets and showered with broken
glass spins around his thompson still firing uncontrol-

lably

Bullets dance across the walls and ceiling blast out the
remaining glass and sing harmlessly into the trees outside

BACK TO LEO
As we hear the screech of skidding tires A black coupe
takes a curve on the street behind him machine gun fire

spitting out of the back window

Leo turns in the glow of the fanning flames walking
calmly into the street firing at the receeding car

ON THE CAR

Growing smaller still snitting fire and lead

PULLING LEO
Still walking calmly up the street the gun still bucking

in his hands Bullets whistle by and claw up the pavement
around him

BEHIND LEO

His robe whips back in the breeze He fires again and we
hear the distant sound of shattering glass The car
weaves runs up off the road hits a tree and bursts into

flame

A figure emerges from the car and staggers off into the
darkness He is on fire

CLOSE ON LEO

As he stops squinting raising the gun
HIS POV

The burning gunman zig-zagging into the darkness

BACK TO LEO

A faint smile curls around the cigar He drops the muzzle
of the gun

Leo
Huhh

The shell of the car explodes in a fireball as we

CUT TO
UPSTAIRS HALLWAY SHENANDOAH CLUB

The explosion echoes over the cut as we track up the
hallway behind Tom and a tall cadaverous man with pre-
maturely white hair This is Dead Terry McGill

against the walls barely acknowledging the two men

Mother hen huh Whats the matter Tommy you
think I cant take care of myself

Tom
I know you cant Heres the smart play Leo
you lay back give up Bernie let Caspar think
hes made his point Wait for him to show you a

weakness--
Leo
Please Tom
Tom stares at him
Tom

Youre sticking on Bernie Sticking your neck
out for a guy whod chop you off at the heels if
there was two bits in it

Leo leans back in his chair puts his feet up and gazes
out the window

Leo
Tom it aint all as clear-cut as you make
it Bernies--Well hell you know about me
and Verna Things now are--not that I havent
been a gentleman but I uh I plan to

ask her to marry me Tom

There is a long awkward silence Leo avoids Toms look
but finally responds to the silence

I guess you think thats a bonehead play

Tom
Do you think she wants you to

Leo
How the hell do I know Tom I think she
does Yeah course she does I know I

know you think different but--well we just
differ on that

Tom

Leo
Tom takes a deep breath and exhales

Caspar didnt kill Rug

Absently

This

Leo
Course he did

Tom
No Think about it Just this one time Who
was Rug following

gets Leos attention He turns to look at Tom

Leo
Huh

Tom
It neednt have been that sinister A strange
man following her down a dark alley late at
night Ive told you Leo she can take care
of herself

Leo stares at Tom He seems somewhat dazed

Leo
Tom whyre you saying that Christ Tom
just told you I plan to

Tom
They pulled a 22 slug out of him A pop gun
Leo--a womans gun

fq

Leo
Thats a whiskey dream Verna wouldnt
panic--shoot someone--just because he was
following her

He gazes off again shaking his head

No It wouldnt have happened that way
in the first place and if it had she would have
told me I know you dont like her Tom but

I trust Verna as much as I trust you

Tom
On her account youll burn the town down

Leo
Dont worry Tom Well still be standing when
the smoke clears
Toms tone is gentle

Tom
Okay Leo Then maybe it wasnt that innocent
Maybe Rug knew something she didnt like him
knowing and wouldnt want you to know He was
following her He knew who she was seeing He
knew where she was sleeping and who with

Leo has taken his feet off the sill and has turned back to
face Tom He studies him carefully

Leo
Maybes dont make it so

Toms suddenly very earnest almost beseeching

Tom
Theyre more than maybes Youve trusted me
before and never lost anything by it Trust me
on this

Leo
This is too important
Tom

dont ask much and I dont ask often Trist
me on this

Leo

fq

Tommy -—
Tom
rust me on this or the hell with you

fq

Leo
You dont mean that

Tom
She was at my place The night Rug was

following her the night you dropped by

Leo is still staring impassively at Tom Tom doesnt
flinch from his gaze

After a long beat Leo gets up slowly from his chair walks
over to the window shoves his hands in his pockets and
gazes out

For a moment Tom looks at Leos motionless back but he has
nothing left to say He rises plucks his hat from the

desk and goes to the door Before exiting he looks back
Leo in long shot is still gazing out the window

Tom exits

HALLWAY
Pulling Tom up the hall

Behind him we can see the door to Leos office opening and
Leo coming out He strides up the hall after Tom

fq

om turns as Leo reaches him

Leo without breaking stride seems to walk right into him
throwing a punch that catches Tom on the chin and sends him
stumbling back his hat flying off

fq

The men lining the hall watch with casual interest

fq

om staggers into one of the men who catches him Another
man has picked up Toms hat and now hands it to him The
first man shoves Tom back into the middle of the hall just
in time for the approaching Leo to land another punch
against his jaw

This blow sends Tom rolling down the staircase still
clutching his hat

Leo is clomping down the stairs his army of private
retainers clomp down behind him In his shirtsleeves and
chomping an unlit cigar Leo looks like a labor leader
taking the rank and file to the barricades

Tom claws himself up the wall to his feet

Leo has reached the floor and still without breaking stride
uppercuts Tom with a blow that straightens him up and sends
him staggering like a drunk into gamblers in evening
dresses and tuxedos

A path clears for Leo and his entourage He has not
slackened his pace but is also not hurrying Tom weaves
watching Leo approach but makes no attempt to defend
himself

Leo grabs his own wrist with one hand and swings his elbow
up to catch Tom with a sharp blow on the side of his face

Tom spins into a screaming lady in a sequined evening dress
and sinks to the floor grabbing at her bodice and skirt for
support She bats at him with her handbag as he slips
down

Fat Tony emerges from the crowd and helps Tom to his feet
He raises his hand to stop Leo

Tony
Okay Leo I1l throw him out

Leo stops panting He is looking at Tom but speaking to to
Tony

Leo
Yeah Do that Its the kiss-off If
I never see him again itll be soon enough

CUT TO
TOMS APARTMENT

Wide shot of his living room facing the windows It is
night

Tom sits with his back to us at the window feet propped up
on the sill He is smoking a cigarette A full ashtray on
a table at his side indicates that he has been sitting
there for some time

We are slowly tracking in
The telephone sits on the the arm of his chair After a

moment he stubs out the cigarette picks up the phone and
dials

Tom
Lo Frankie its Tom hows the flunky
business Ive had worse your ventilator

healing up

Offscreen we hear a knocking at the door to the apartment
Tom ignores it

Tell Caspar its already forgotten Id
like to see him

The knocking continues

All right do what you have to do and let
me know

He cradles the phone lights another cigarette takes a
drag blows a thoughtful cloud of smoke and turns to face
the door After a beat he rises and leaves frame

THE DOOR

As Tom swings it open Verna stands in the hallway
outside After a wordless beat she moves past him into the
apartment Tom turns and follows her

He walks over to his bar pours two drinks then crosses
the room to Verna who has seated herself hands her a drink
and sits down in a chair facing hers

Verna
It worked whatever you did Leo told me
were quits But you know I didnt have anything
to do with Rug
Tom
Maybe not Anyway that isnt what soured him
on you
The thought is bitter but her tone isnt
Verna
Oh you and me huh You always take the long
way around to get what you want dont you Tom
You could have just asked

Tom looks at her

Tom
What did I want

Verna returns his look then answers evenly

Verna
Me

After a beat Tom his eyes still on Verna brings the glass
to his lips and takes a sip The ice cubes clink

FADE OUT

FADE IN
THE BEDROOM

Tom sits perched on the edge of the bed smoking a ciga-
rette Verna is in bed behind him The lamp on the
nightstand is burning a faint yellow

The telephone rings
As Tom reaches for it Verna stirs behind him

Tom
Yeah

He reaches over to switch off the light when he does the
room remains illuminated by dull gray light it is dawn

Yeah yeah when Okay
He hangs up and continues to smoke staring absently off

Verna
Youre still up

Tom answers without turning to face her

Tom
Yeah

Verna
Whatre you chewing over

Tom
Remembering something

Verna
What was it

Tom turns to look at her then turns back and looks out the
window

Tom
Just a dream I was walking in the woods dont
know why The wind came up and blew my hat
off

Verna

And you chased it right You ran and ran and
finally you caught up to it and picked it up but
it wasnt a hat anymore It had changed into
something else--something wonderful

Tom
No It stayed a hat And no I didnt chase it
I watched it blow away
He takes a drag an the cigarette

Nothing more foolish than a man chasing his
hat

Tom rouses himself rises and we pan to follow as he picks
up a shirt and starts buttoning it in the bureau mirror

Verna
Wherere you going

Tom
Out

Verna stares at him

Verna
Dont let on more than you have to

Tom shrugs

Tom
Just have to do a few things

Verna
You and Leo might still be able to patch
things up

Tom grimaces into the mirror

Tom
Me and Leo are finished Nothings going to
change that

Verna
You never know Hes got a big heart

Tom
Were quits--as far as Im concerned never mind
him And if Leo did want me back hes an even
bigger sap than I thought

Verna
Then why dont we just pick up and leave
town Theres nothing keeping you here I know
theres nothing keeping me

Tom is starting to knot a tie

Tom
What about Bernie
Verna
He could come with us

Tom
You me and Bernie Where would we go Verna
Niagara Falls

Verna
Why do you hate him

Tom
I dont hate anyone

Verna
Or like anyone

Tom
Whatever Where is Bernie

Verna looks at him

Verna
Why

Tom
Leo cant protect him anymore I ought to tell
him to skip

Verna
The Royale Room three-oh-two

She gazes off

I guess we both double-crossed Leo theres
no getting around that I guess hes well rid of
both of us

Tom
Verna
The two of us were about bad enough to deserve

each other

Tom
Are we

Verna
Were a couple of heels Tom Yes we are
PULLING TOM

Into a dark office Behind him Frankie his nose swathed
with bandages is closing the door from the outside

Caspar (off)
Lo Kid You know OGar

TOMS POV

Caspar sits behind his desk Bluenoint sits slouched on a
couch to one side wearing his hat his hands jammed into
the pockets of his overcoat

In two chairs facing the desk away from us sit two men
who are twisting around to smile at Tom

Caspar
and the mayor

Tom
Lo boys

Mayor

Caspar
Sfine sfine Well Tom and mes got the
proverbial fat to chew--

The mayor and OGar are already rising to their feet

Mayor

Tom sits into one of the vacated chairs facing Caspar
So you had enough time to think about it

Tom
Yeah well circumstances have changed

Caspar
Dont I know it Last night I know Bluepoint
was disappointed the bulls showed up before
Frankie and Tic-Tac could really pin your ears
back but I said Relax Bluepoint I got a
feeling about this kid Take the long view The
kid and Leo are gonna go bust-o If the kid aint
ready yet well he soon will be Matter of

time I said the kids too smart for Leo

Thats what I said Like a psychic Ask
Bluepoint if I didnt Like a goddamn psychic
Gahead Ask him

Tom turns to look at Bluepoint

Tom
You vouch for this psychic business

From the couch Bluepoint sneers

Bluepoint
Thats right smart guy

Caspar cheerfully continues oblivious to any hostility in
the room

Caspar
I know you knew protecting the Motzah was a dumb
idea I know you been wise to all of Leos dumb
ideas lately Only a matter of time Bust-o

He chuckles

Thats why last night we didnt put the arm
on you Only Leo

Tom
Seeing how you squiffed your play on Leo I can
be only so grateful

Bluepoint
Thats brave coming from Little Miss Punching
Bag

Caspar

Cmon Bluepoint Friends now huh

Bluepoint

Caspar smiles at Tom
Caspar
So we get a little jingle And I figure you know
Leos on his way out Its only a matter of time

before we get him Am I right kid

Tom

Caspar laughs

Caspar

So I guess youre looking for a job

Tom

Caspar laughs

Caspar

Bluepoint says nothing His scowl is set in cement

Im jokin of course We all know you can
be useful to us a smart kid such as yaself the
man who walks behind the man and whispers in his
ear I guess you could be useful in spades

Tom
Yeah I can do plenty for you But the fact is
that right now Leos still got all his vital
signs and once he hears about this hell be more
anxious to get to me than to either of you

Caspar
Im tellin ya not to worry about Leo We got
plans for him

Tom
Yeah What

Bluepoint
Not so fast there Kaputnik

There is a beat through which Caspar continues to smile at
Tom

Caspar

I think what the Bluepoint is trying to say
is therell be time to talk about that That
can be tabled for a later date See the last
time we jawed you gave-me the high hat So I
guess Im sayin maybe we want your confidence
before we give you ours You gotta put somethin
on the table Ante up
Tom
Fair enough Where shall we start

Caspar
Hear that Bluepoint All business I told you
he was a good kid Where shall we start All
business

He rocks back in his chair and dries his eyes Tom smiles
pleasantly Finally Caspar sighs

Well we could start for instance with the
Motzah Like wheres the Motzah You could
maybe tell us that

Tom
The Royale Room three-oh-two You might find
Mink with him

Bluepoint
The hell you say

Tom
Sure Bernie and Mink are as cozy as lice

He turns to look at Bluepoint
And it aint just business

Caspar looks at Bluepoint Bluepoints eyes bare into Tom

Bluepoint

Bluepoint

Tom shrugs

Tom
Ill sit facing the corner in a funny hat

cut To
INT CAR

Tom sits behind the wheel of the parked car we are an his
profile

Toms face is rigidly set we dont know why as we watch
him for a short beat

BAM--with a loud impact Bernie Bernheims face is slammed
against the drivers window Tom still faces forward

Bernie is wailing as he is muscled back away from the
window by two topcoated torsos--their faces above the car
window

They muscle Bernie out of frame towards the rear of the car
and we hear the back door being opened

Bernies voice off is near hysteria

Bernie
Frankie let me go Im prayin to ya Jesus God-
-Tom Jesus

As Frankie and Tic-Tac pile Bernie into the back we
continue to hold on Toms face He still does not react

Bernie

You gotta talk to em Tommy

Frankie
You gimme a headache you little sheeny

To Tom
Tic-Tac

Finally

Frankie

As Tom reaches forward and starts the car
Bernie
Youre not part of this Tom Help me These

Tic-Tac
Whack you inna mouth you dont shut up

39 MILLERS CROSSING WIDE
Day A wooded area outside of town The wind blows
The car pulls into frame and stops on the shoulder The
backseat passengers--Frankie Tic-Tac and Bernie--emerge
Tom remains in the drivers seat
Bernie is weeping loudly he has lost control Frankie
takes out a gun and whacks him smartly on the side of his
head The blow sends him stumbling over towards Tic-Tac
who kicks him down

The blows havent quelled Bernies sobbing

Tic-Tac
I dont want you runnin anywhere

Frankie takes a swig from his flask and hands it to Tic-
Tac who leans in the car window

INT CAR

Tom gazes forward jaw set eyes off the doings outside
As Tic-Tac hands his gun in through the window

Tic-Tac
Okay Take him in the woods and whack him

Tom
Huh I dont

Tic-Tac
Yeah thats right the boss wants you to do it
Make sure youre with the good guys

Tom stares dumbly at the gun Tic-Tac holds it grip
towards Tom motionless

After a beat he takes the gun
Tic-Tac
You know how to do this right You gotta
remember to put one in his brain Your first
shot puts him down then you put one in his

brain Then hes dead then we go home

Tom opens his door

WIDE EXT

Bernie is still on the ground sobbing not responding to
Frankie who prods him with his foot

Frankie
Get up

Bernie
I cant get up I cant get up

Frankie drags him to his feet

Frankie
Get up and walk you chiselin little yid

He pushes him towards the woods and reaches for the whiskey
flask

Bernie stumbles off Tom follows him

TRACK

Through the woods pulling the two men Bernie in the
foreground Tree limbs groan in the wind

Bernie is stumbling his clothes rumpled and dirty his
face stained by tears and blood from the gun blow His

shaking voice strains for a tone of reasonableness

Bernie
Tommy you cant do this You dont bump

Tom marches on face drawn silent

Its not right Tom They cant make us do

little information for a chisel thats all I
couldnt help it Tom its my nature Somebody

Still no response from Tom Bernie is fighting a losing
battle to keep himself from whining

But Ill tell you what I never crossed a
friend Huh Tom Never killed anybody never
crossed a friend Nor you Ill bet Were not
like those animals You cant do this Youre
not like those animals This is not us This is
some hop dream

Toms face is a ---ny mask Bernie is losing control
again He starts to weep

Its a dream Tommy Im praying to you
I cant die I cant die Out here in the
woods Like a dumb animal I cant die

He turns and sinks to his knees wailing his hands clasped
in front of him staring up at Tom

You cant kill me Im praying to you
look in your heart Im praying to you Look in
your heart
Tom stares down at Bernie his face drawn and pale
Im praying to you Look in your heart
Slowly Tom raises the gun and levels it at Bernies head

Look in your heart Look in your--

BOOM The gun blast is deafening With it Bernies
sobbing abruptly stops

The shot echoes away in the woods taking the wind with it
leaving silence

CLOSE BERNIE
Still kneeling in shock staring wide-eyed at Tom
Finally whispering

Bernie

Tom

Still whispering

Bernie

Tom
Shutup Just get the hell out before I change

Bernie is already on his feet and running

CLOSE ON TOM

Watching Bernie go

TRACKING
Pulling Bernie as he runs Foreground trees flash by In
the background we see Tom standing his gun dangling at his
side

Boom--another gun blast Running Bernie reacts but Tom
has only fired into the ground

On the echo of the shot we cut to

WIDE THE ROAD

Tic-Tac and Frankie are leaning against the car trading
the flask back and forth

In the background Tom emerges from the woods

Frankie
Put one in his brain

Tom takes a few steps more before answering

Tom
Yeah

Frankie
Attaboy

FADE OUT

Over black we hear the sound of coins being dropped into a
phone box

FADE IN

Looking down a deserted street towards a glowing phone
booth on a dark corner Tom stands inside the booth
waiting the receiver to his ear

Tom
Mink Tom Duchaisne Whereve you been
CLOSE ON TOM
Inside the phone booth
Well youre lucky Bluepoints been looking
for you Bernies dead--Stop wailing and listen

to me Caspar knows you were in on selling out
his fix I guess I gave him that idea Sorry
Mink we were chatting and it just slipped out--
Shutup and let me talk Youve gotta make
yourself missing but let me know where you hole
up Youre gonna say some things for me

Some stories About Bluepoint to Caspar--dont
worry Ill let you know For now just dis-

appear Yeah I got you into it Just
remember Mink Im the only one who can get you
out

Tom hangs up the phone turns around and opens up the glass
door

WHOMMMP A fist slams into his stomach driving him back
into the phone booth knocking his hat off of his head

The man who hit him leans down picks up the hat dusts it
off and hands it into the booth It is Dead Terry the
tall cadaverous man we saw earlier outside of Leos office
A cigarette dangles from his lower lip

Behind him a black sedan is parked at the curb Three or
four gunmen stand on the sidewalk looking warily up and
down the road

Tom looks up the color drained from his face and reaches
feebly out for his hat

Tom
Lo Terry Getting out the vote

Dead Terry flicks his cigarette away and smiles

Terry
Message from Leo Leo says if youre smart
youll sit this one out--not that he cares one
way or the other Leo says if youre on the
wrong side you take your chances like anyone
else Leo says he gives no special favors
Thats all

Tom
Mm

Terry starts to turn away
Tell Leo hes not God on the throne hes
just a cheap mick political boss with no brains
and an office that looks like a French whore-

house

Tom moves to exit the booth but Terry lays a hand on his
shoulder

Terry
One more thing

He cracks Tom across the chin with a clean left hook
knocking him back into the booth again

Tom rubs his chin looking up at Terry

Tom
Leo say that too

As Terry and the gunmen get into the car
Terry
No I said that Cross Leo and next time Ill
say plenty
We FADE OUT as the door slams and the car roars off
Over black we hear
Caspar
When youre right youre right but you never say
I told you so
FADE IN

On Tom sitting into frame in Caspars office

Tom
So whatm I right about

Behind his desk Caspar is smiling
Caspar
Well Ill tell ya but first you gotta promise
not to say I told you so

Toms eyes hold an Caspars He is taking out a pack of
cigarettes

Tom
I never say that And I dont like people who
do

Caspar

Mink was robbin me right along with the Mptzah

Tom
What convinced you of that
Caspar
Mink Larouie took a powder We cant find him
Bluepoints makin excuses for him but personal-
ly I think you were right I think Mink and
Bernie was in it together I think Mink heard
youd bumped the Motzah and lit out The lousy
sonofabitch

His eyes on Caspar Tom takes out a cigarette lights it
takes a deep drag

Tom
I told you so

Caspar laughs

Caspar
Okay You got a lip on ya Ats all right I
dont generally care for it but thats all
right You were a good sport to bump the
Motzah I just like to make sure my friends is
my friends So

He throws his hands up
Friends right

Tom
How dyou know Mink skipped

Caspar
Bluepoint cant find him

Tom
So he says

Caspar stares at Tom

Caspar
Meanin what exactly

Tom
Maybe nothing I didnt give it much thought
until now since a guy will say pretty much
anything when he knows his number is up but just
before I bumped Bernie he swore to me that
Bluepoint and Mink were setting him up That
they were the ones that were selling out your
fix

Caspar looks at Tom
Caspar
Zat so

He thinks for a beat
Like you say a guyll say anything

Tom
Uh-huh So why isnt Bluepoint here

Caspar
Well

He figdets

He dont care for you kid Maybe its
only fair to tell you After you left us he
tried to sell me on a double-cross He says to
me why dont we double-cross you and give you
the bump once we get the Motzah But I figure a
deals a deal youre square with me you bump the
Motzah Ill hold up my end Question of ethics
Everything above board thats how I like it so
everybody knows whos a friend and whos an

enemy But Bluepoint wouldnt cross me We
go back

Tom
Uh-huh Course theres always that wild card

when love is involved
Caspar is staring intently at Tom After a beat
Caspar
I know Mink is Bluepoints boy but I still
dont make it that way

Tom
Mm Well then theres nothing to worry about

Caspar seems lost in thought

Caspar
Yeah

We hear the door to the office open offscreen and Johnny
Jv runs into frame clutching a scrolled piece of paper

Johnny Jr
Poppa Poppa I got a prize from the--
Caspar holds his hand up to quiet the youngster still
looking at Tom

Caspar
Just a minute

As Tom rises to his feet

Course theres no reason not to be
careful--

Johnny Jr
Poppa Poppa The sisters gave me a--unnnh

Cascar has cuffed him sharply on the side of the head
He points at Tom

Caspar
Shaddap You take a page outta this guys book
A little less you talk and a little more you
think

Cascar looks at Tom and smiles

Kids Ya gotta be firm Anyways You
know what Im sayin No reason to worry but no
reason not to investigate neither If Mink is
around I want you to find him He can tell us
whats what

(to Johnny Jr)

Whats a matter somebody hit you whats a

matter we aint friends anymore

He picks up Johnny Jr who is crying softly and sets him
in his lap Encouraged by the attention the child starts
wailing Caspar bounces him on his knee and raises his
voice over the sobs

If you find him I wanna talk to him alone
Thats how you get the straight dope Man-to-
man Just me Mink

He pats his jacket where his shoulder holster is

and my friend roscoe Yunderstand what
Im sayin

Tom takes a contemplative drag on his cigarette

Tom
It aint complicated

CLOSE SHOT A MANS FACE

Crunch--being hit by a gloved hand

The blow and the mans grunt echo

CLOSE ON A NEWSPAPER

As the noise of fists against flesh continues echoing in
the background

The newspaper headline reads PARTY BOSS LOOSES MUNICIPAL
CONTRACT The subhead reads Liam (Leo) OBannon Removed
From City Highway Commission New Construction Contracts
To Raffo Bros

ON TOM

Leaning against a pillar in a large bare room with a
hardwood floor He is reading the newspaper

We are in a gym Ina ring in the background two boxers
are sparring as two or three old men with towels slung over
their shoulders and elbows hooked over the ropes idly
watch and offer occasional bits of half-hearted advice

We hear high heels echoing across the floor and Verna
enters

Tom
You should leave town for a few days things are
going to heat up here Go out to the Pallisades

She reaches out to touch his hand--

Verna

She leans in to embrace him

Toms eyes drift up to the fighters

45 EXT THE GYM

Peeling paint on its blackened-out window reads Gleasons
Gym Training in The Sweet Science

Verna is exiting the gym in long shot
We pull back to bring Bluepoint into frame He sits in the
drivers seat of a car watching through his side window as

Verna recedes Quietly

Bluepoint

Bluepoint reaches for the ignition as we hear the car door
open

Ill see where the twist flops

CUT TO
INT SPEAKEASY

A hand swings through frame holding the barrel of a gun
smashing the butt into a surprised face

With a loud crash the surprised man stumbles back into a
table and hits the floor Legs and the skirts of an
overcoat approach the prostrate round middle-aged man and
start kicking him

He rolls across the floor trying to shield himself from the
blows

So what genius I had my troat slit once

Tom
Sure Whisper but normal peoples brains need
oxygen--

BOOM--Behind the three men the front of the speakeasy
blows--glass flying flame licking out

Though there is commotion among the passers-by Tom Bert
and Whisper dont even turn around to look

Bert
Get the car will ya Whisper
As Whisper trots out into the street

Tom
Dont tell Bluepoint I was asking about him

Bert
Yeah yeah

Tom
Caspar just wanted me to check up make sure hes
doing everything he can--
There is a faint but distinct popping sound

Tom looks into the street

Whisper is staggering around as if drunk He turns to
face Tom and Bert

He lurches toward them A red stain is blossoming on his
chest

The ambient hubbub fades to total silence we hear only the
crisp staggering scuffle of Whispers shoes as he stumbles
into the foreground looking stunned

He drops

A woman screams

Noise wells up

Bert is unhoistering his gun looking up

Tom looks where Bert is looking

FACING ROOFTOP
A man with a distinctive shock of white hair--Dead Terry

McGill He puts up his gun and starts running along the
roof

BERT

Starts running along the street to keep pace firing up at
the facing roof

A POLICE CAR
Siren wailing up on two wheels taking a speeding turn
onto the street

It is speeding towards Bert

PULLING BERT
Running he is pointing and bellowing at the car
Bert
Leos man Up there
POLICE CAR

Cops with guns hang out every window They start firing

TRACKING TOWARDS BERT

Bert
Up there Leos--

A hail of bullets cuts him to pieces A limp rag he hits
the road

The police car squeals to a halt in front of his corpse A
sergeant and his men pile out

Tom is sauntering over smoking a cigarette

Sergeant
Lo Tom Chalk one up for the good guys huh

Tom
Yeah Casparll be thrilled You just shot one

of his apes

Sergeant
Bullshit

Toms attention is drawn by something down the street

HIS POV

About a block away a man with white hair is crossing the
street from the side where the snipers shot came from

Sergeant (off)
Im tellin you thats Two-Toe Jackson Hes
Leos

BACK TO TOM
As he starts to leave

Tom
Its Bert Sachetti Caspars bang-man

Behind him the Sergeant bellows at another cop

Sergeant
Bullshit Take his shoes off Count his goddamn
toes

INT DINER

Dead Terry McGill sits at a stool looking angrily down at a
cup of coffee Tom enters to sit next to him

Through the windows behind them we can see people running
back and forth on the street a fire engine racing past--
furious activity its noise muted inside the diner

Tom
Lo Terry You werent aiming at me were you

Terry does not even look over at him Sullenly

Terry
In the first place I dont know what youre
talking about In the second place if I had
been aiming at you Idve hit you In the third
place I dont know what youre talking about in
the first place

He tosses some coins onto the counter and gets up We hold
on Tom as Terry talks to Toms back

Id like to have believe me Leo wont
let me--yet But Ill bring him around

He puts a hand on Toms stoulder and swivels him around
Terry clenches a fist and draws it back to throw a punch

Tom and Terry look at each other Tom making no movement to
defend himself

After a long beat Terry uncldnches his fist and sneers

I wont give you the satisfaction

cut To
DOORKNOB

As--CRASH--a foot enters to kick it and the door in

INT VERNAS APARTMENT

Verna is backing away from the door--behind us--into the
apartment Bluepoint strides into frame

Bluepoint
Know who I am

Verna continues to back away Bluepoint continues to
advance

Verna
Yeah Johnny Caspars shadow Did he stay in bed
today

Bluepoint
Jesus I open my mouth the whole world turns
smart

He glances around the room Verna is backing around the
couch Bluepoint continues to follow her

What business dyou have with Tom Duchaisne

Verna
None

She continues to back away Bluepoint continues to follow

Bluepoint
Youre Leos twist right

Verna
Me and Leo are through

She picks up her purse from the sill behind the couch and
rummages Bluepoint doesnt seem to mind

Bluepoint
Yeah So youre sluttin around with Tom now
huh
Verna has taken a gun from her purse she levels it at
Bluepoint

Verna
Get outta here

As he continues to stride towards her

Bluepoint
Okay see ya later

His hand shoots out in a flash--he has grabbed the gun with
one hand her arm with the other

Before I go whats your boyfriend up to
Verna is stuggling in his grasp to no effect

Verna
Nothing I know about

Bluepoint drags her close nose to nose
Bluepoint
Yeah It doesnt figure for me your dumping
Leo for the guy who put a bullet in your brother
Verna stops resisting and stares at him
Bluepoint stares back at her thinking

Didnt tell you huh

We hear a footstep offscreen

REVERSE
Facing the door from behind Bluepoint and Verna

Bluepoint wheels swinging her body in front of his as two
topcoated men enter guns drawn

Both intruders hold fire their shot blocked by Verna The
gun in Bluepoints hand barks once

The lead man pitches forward his gun clattering away
His partner is ducking back out the door

Verna still struggles futilely Bluepoint keeps his gun
peeking out from behind Verna trained on the empty
doorway

The man an the floor still alive has started clawing
himself towards his gun a few paces away

Bluepoint ignores him He stares at the open door
After a silent beat from the hall

Man In Hall
Let her go Bluepoint theres nothing you
can do Leave by the fire escape Theres more
of us on the way--

BANG--Bluepoint fires

Wood splinters in the door which shudders back a few more
inches towards the wall The voice from the hall has
stopped short

After a short silent beat we hear a gun clattering to the
floor outside in the hall

We hear fabric drag across wall and then see the dead man
drop to the floor just outside the door

Bluepoint tosses Verna away and saunters unhurriedly over
to the first man who has almost reached his gun

Just as the mans hand closes over it Bluepoint in stride
steps onto the hand and gun Most of his weight is on it

Head cocked he looks down at the man in front of him

Bluepoint
You Leos

Man
Yeah He wanted her looked out for

Bluepoint
Well you did a bang-up job Ill be sure to tell
him Where is Leo

Man
If I tell you how do know you wont kill
me

Bluepoint
Because if you told me and I killed you and you
were lying then I wouldnt get to kill you then

Wheres Leo
The man is sweating
Man
Hes--hes moving around But tomorrow
night hes getting his mob together at Whiskey
Nicks

Bluepoint points his gun at the mans head

Bluepoint
You sure

Man
Check it Its gold

Bluepeint
You know something yegg I believe you

BANG

Bluepoint straightens up from the body and turns

LOW AND WIDE ON BLUEPOINT

One corpse an the floor beside him the other corpse in the
doorway behind him

He absently wraps one hand around the warm barrel of the
gun then brings the hand up to blow against its open palm

Bluepoint
Go ahead and run sweetie

HIS POV THE WINDOW

The main zoom is now empty Sheers billow at the window
now open that lets out on the fire escape Off

Bluepoint
Ill track down all a you whores

DISSOLVE THROUGH TO
WINDOW NIGHT

Sheers billow in the breeze

TOM

Sitting up in bed smoking a cigarette thinking The
bedroom is dark

There is a knock at the apartments front door Tom
reacts but does not immediately rise

The knock is repeated

Tom finally throws the covers off and swings his feet
around to the floor

But the knocking stops and another sound brings him up
short The person at the door is now playing with the
lock

Tom sits motionless listening

After some rattling we hear the lock spring then the door
swinging open then shut again We hear footsteps cross
the main room and then the squeak of chair springs
Silence

Tom rises and walks to the living room doorway He leans
against the jamb

HIS POV

The windows throw moonlit squares onto the floor We can
see only the legs of someone sitting in the armchair

Tom
Lo Bernie Come on in make yourself at home

Bernie turns on the lamn on the table at his elbow He
holds a gun casually in his lap

Bernie
Lo Tom Thought Id do that since you didnt
seem to be in Figured it was a bad idea to wait
in the hall seeing as Im supposed to be dead

Tom

Bernie
Howd you know it was me
Tom
Youre the only person I knowd knock and break
in

Bernie
Your other friends wouldnt break in huh

Tom shakes his head

Tom
My other friends wanna kill me so they wouldnt
knock

He crosses to the chair facing Bernies
Whats on your mind Bernie

Bernie
Things I guess you must be kind of angry
Im supposed to be gone far away I guess it
seems sort of irresponsible my being here

Bernie leaves room for a response but Tom is only listen-
ing

And I was gonna leave Honest I was But
then I started thinking If I stuck around that
would not be good for you And then I started
thinking that that might not be bad for me

Tom still doesnt answer

I guess you didnt see the play you gave
me I mean whatm I gonna do If I leave I got
nothing--no money no friends nothing If I
stay I got you Anyone finds out Im alive--
youre dead so I got you Tommy

Tom is silent

Whats the matter you got nothin to crack
wise about Bernie aint so funny anymore

Bernies lip is quivering His voice is softer
I guess I made kinda a fool a myself out
there I was shittin myself Tommy

you didnt tell anyone about that

Tom
No
Bernie
Course you know about it its Itsa
painful memory And I cant help remembering
that you put the finger on me and you took me
out there to whack me I know you didnt
I know you didnt shoot me but but--

Tom
But what have I done for you lately

Bernie
Dont smart me

He stares hard at Tom for a moment

See I wanna watch you squirm I wanna see
you sweat a little And when you smart me it
ruins it

Bernie gets to his feet keeping the gun trained on Tom

Theres one other thing I want I wanna
see Johnny Caspar cold and stiff Thats what
youll do for your friend Bernie

He has opened the door to the flat
In the meantime Ill stay outa sight But
if Caspar aint stiff in a couple of days I start
eating in restaurants

The door shuts behind him

Tom heretofore very still springs from the chair goes to
the bedroom and reemerges with a gun

He bolts for the door instinctively grabbing his hat off a
hook He is wearing only his boxer shorts a sleeveless
tee-shirt and the hat jammed onto his head

He throws open the door

HALLWAY

Empty

Tom runs to the bannister and looks down

HIS POV

A flight down a hand slides down along the railing

Bernies trotting footsteps echo in the stairwell

TOM

He runs back to his apartment

APARTMENT

Tom runs across to the open window and clambers out

FIRE ESCAPE

Tom trots down His bare feet ring dully against the steel
of the fire escape

He reaches the bottom landing swings over the railing
hangs by his hands for one brief moment and then drops
THE ALLEY

As his bare feet hit the pavement Tom is a silhouette in
the lamplight from the end of the alley

He straightens from his crouch and runs

BACK DOOR

Of his apartment building--over Toms shoulder as he enters
frame The empty brightly lit hall inside runs straight
the length of the building to the front door which is just
closing

Tom throws open the back door

HALLWAY

As Tom runs through toward the front

Before reaching the door he falls violently forward

His gun skates away from him across the floor

He starts to roll over to look behind him and a crunching

blow catches him on the chin snapping his head the rest of
the way around and sending him flat onto his back

Bernie who has emerged from under the staircase towers

over him

Bernie
You make me laugh Tommy Youre gonna catch

cold then youre no

He is walking over to Tom
unloads into his hand

good to me

s gun which he picks up and

What were you gonna do if you caught me
Id just squirt a few and then youd let me go

again

He tosses Tom the empty gun and walks out

Tom white-faced and shivering pulls himself up to sit

leaning against the wall

A first-floor apartment door opens and a sixty-year-old
woman emerges pulling a housecoat tight She goggles at

Tom

Woman
Why Mr Duchaisne What on earth

Tom tries a smile that looks idiotic

Tom
They took everything

LONG SHOT THE HALL

Clucking sympathetically

the old woman is leaning down to

help Tom up As he drapes an arm over her shoulder

I fought like hell but there were too many

Staring at Tom Tony blows air through his teeth He sets
up a drink for Tom

Tony

Reese an undercard bum

Tom downs the drink in a gulp

Tom
Drop Johnson He play your book much

Tony

From offscreen there is a loud CRASH and with that many
of the club patrons start screaming Tony looks off and
Tom swivels to look

Tony
Oh Jesus You bring them with you

As he shoves off from the bar

Tom
No

Uniformed policemen are pouring into the club wielding
axes They destroy everything in their path sweeping the
elegantly dressed patrons before them

Tom wades into the sea of blue and nods at Delahanty the
policeman we know from the raid on Caspars

Tom
Lo Brian Still fighting the good fight

Delahanty
Lo Tom Neither wind nor rain nor snow

Tom
Thats just the mailmen Is OGar here

Delahanty
Just look for the long face
EXT THE CLUB
It is just cracking dawn
OGar is leaning against a car facing the club taking in

the scene as he glumly chews on a toothpick The street is
clogged with police vehicles

Tom approaches

Tom
Lo OGar You dont look happy

OGar
Look at this mess Gutting the golden calf
again

He shakes his head
I dont know whether to laugh or cry

Tom
Yeah its awful confusing You know a yegg
named Drop Johnson

OGar
Weve spanked him a couple times

Tom
Where does he flop

OGar
The Terminal Hotel on Bay Street whenever hes
broke--which is one hundred percent of always
Jesus

He reacts to gunfire from the second story of the club

Dont nobody ask me since Im only the
chief around here but Ill tell you my opinion
Caspars just as crazy as Leo And an eye-tie
into the bargain

As he heads off
Tom

Whats the matter OGar doesnt anything ever
suit you

PULLING TOM

As he walks along a nearby street we can still faintly
hear the sirens and police activity back at the club

A black touring car is tooling up alongside of him Tic-
Tac leans out the drivers window He has welts around his
mouth and looks like he has been a little roughed up

Tic-Tac
Hop in Tom we been lookin for you

Still briskly walking

Tom
Im busy

Tic-Tac
Hop in anyway as in you aint got no choice

Tom
You cant hijack me Tic-Tac were on the same
side now--or didnt you get that far in school

The car screeches over to put a wheel on the sidewalk and
block Toms way The back door swings open and Frankie
emerges to help Tom in Like Tic-Tac Frankie looks a
little worked over

Tom quickly sizes up the situation and decides to comply

INT CAR

As Tom sits into the back next to Bluepoint Frankie
slides in after him

Bluepoint
Howd you get the fat lip

The car starts moving

Tom
Old war wound Acts up around morons

Bluepoint
Very smart What were you doing at the club
Talking things over with Leo

Tom
Dont think so hard Bluepoint you might sprain
something

Bluepoint

Youre so goddamn smart Except you aint I
get you smart guy I know what you are
Straight as a corkscrew Mr Inside-Outsky
Like a goddamn bolshevik picking up your orders
from Yegg Central You think youre so goddamn
smart

He sneers

You joined up with Caspar You bumped Bernie
Bernheim Down is up Black is white Well I
think youre half-smart I think you were
straight with your frail and queer with Johnny
Caspar And I think youd sooner join the
Ladies League then gun a guy down

His eyes narrow at Tom

Then I hear that these two geniuses never
even saw this rub-out take place

Defensively

Tic-Tac
The boss just said have him do it he didnt say
nothing about--

Bluepoint
Shutup or maybe you still got too many teeth

Tic-Tac sulks Bluepoint turns and gazes out the window of
the car

Everyones so goddamn smart Well well
go to Millers Crossing And well see whos
smart

EXT WOODS

It is morning the sun is now fully up Bluepoint and Tom
walk side-by-side through the woods Frankie and Tic-Tac
walk several steps ahead of them each off to one side
searching Frankie is singing an old Neapolitan song

Bluepoint
Yunderstand if we dont find a stiff out here
we leave a fresh one

Tom walks a little unsteadily His shoulders are hunched
and his hands are jammed into his overcoat packets He
stares woodenly forward Bluepoint laughs softly

Wherere your friends when you need
huh Wheres Leo now

Tom tramps mechanically on His eyes drift up
HIS POV

Tracking A canopy of leaves sprinkled by sunlight
The boughs of the trees sough quietly in the wind

We hear the unearthly groaning of the tree limbs

TOM
Looks forward
Bluepoint calls out
Bluepoint
Hey Tic-Tac ever notice how the snappy dialogue
dries up once a guy starts soiling his union

suit

Tom tramps on

HIS POV
The backs of Frankie and Tic-Tac as they walk on ahead

Frankie is still singing

TOM
He looks stupidly at Bluepoint He looks ahead
He stops abruptly
Bluepoint
What
Tom is still for a moment then with jerky movements gets
down on his knees hugs a tree with one arm for support

and vomits

Bluepoint watches him then calls out to Frankie and Tic-
Tac

Okay theres nothing out here

He grabs Toms hat off his head and flings it away Then
he plants a foot against Toms side and shoves him to the
ground

CLOSE ON TOM
As his face hits the ground

Bluepoints foot enters he plants it an the side of Toms
neck to keep him pinned

TOMS POV
Skewed angle from the ground

Frankie is ambling back singing

BLUEPOINT
Checking the open chamber of his gun He snaps it shut
As he levels the gun at Tom
Bluepoint

Think about this smart guy
TOM
Closing his eyes
From offscreen

Tic-Tac
Uh-oh hankie time

FRANKIE

He stops singing and turns to look

TOM

The foot comes off his neck

BLUEPOINT

Looking towards Tic-Tac
TIC-TAC

Taking a handkerchief out of his breast pocket and bringing
it to his face as he looks at something on the ground in
front of him

BLUEPOINT

He hauls Tom to his feet and pushes him towards Tic-Tac

We track behind the two men as they approach Tic-Tac and
Frankie enters from the side

We cannot yet see what is on the ground in front of him

Tic-Tac
Birds been at him

Frankie is taking out his hankie as he draws near

Frankie
Jesus Christ

He looks up at Tom as Tom approaches
Over Tom and Bluepoints shoulders stretching away from
us face-up is a body We cannot see much of its face
what we do see is pulp
Tic-Tac is laughing incredulously
Tic-Tac
I said put one in his brain not in his
stinking face

EXTREME LONG SHOT

Four very small men in overcoats and fedoras looking down
at the ground they are dwarfed by the surrounding trees

Very faintly we can hear

Frankie
I told you Bluepoint we heard two shots

QUICK FADE OUT

APARTMENT BUILDING DOOR BUZZER

A beat-up panel in the buildings entryway listing
tenants names and apartments opposite a row of buttons

A hand coasts along the names and stops at CLARENCE
JOHNSON4C then moves away and presses two other buzzers
on the fifth floor

After a beat we hear the front door buzz open

FOURTH-FLOOR HALLWAY

Tom walks up to 4C unpocketing a gun He gently tries the
knob which turns and enters

DROPS APARTMENT

As Tom enters

Drop Johnson is sitting at a table in the living room
which also serves as kitchen and dining room He is a
large man with a thick neck a low forehead and rather
vacant eyes

He is looking up at Tom a spoonful of cereal frozen
halfway to his mouth a folded-back newspaper in his other

hand opened to the funnies

Tom
Lo Drop Howre the Katzenjammers

Uncomfortably

Drop
Lo Tom Whats the rumpus

As he talks Tom walks casually around the apartment
bumping open doors sticking his head in each room

Tom
Had any visitors

Drops head swivels to follow Tom around the room aside
from that he does not move He speaks cautiously

Drop
No

Tom
Not ever Drop

Drop
Not lately

Tom nods

Tom
Then you must be happy to see me

Drop doesnt respond

So you didnt see Bernie Bernheim before
he was shown across

Drop
No

Tom
Seen him since

Drop maintains a sullen silence
Tom is picking up a hat from a clutter on top of a bureau
Tom
One last question Drop I hear youve got a lot
of money on tomorrows fight Is that your bet
or did you place it for a friend
Drop
No uh its my bet I just TI have a
good feeling about that fight

Toms stroll through the apartment has brought him behind
where Drop sits

Tom
A good feeling huh When did the feeling return
to your head

Drop
Huh

Tom puts the hat on top of Drops head Drops eyes roll
up to look at it but otherwise he still doesnt move

The hat too small sits ludicrously atop his head
Tom starts toward the door

Tom

Youve outgrown that one Must be all the
thinking youve been doing

He pauses with his hand on the knob

Tell Bernie somethings come up He has to
get in touch Therell be nothing stirring til I
talk to him

He slams the door

CUT TO
A LARGE WINDOW

We are looking at the ground-floor window from the street
Letters stencilled on the glass identify the SONS OF ERIN
SOCIAL CLUB

A topcoated man scurries into frame knocks out a pane with
the grip of a gun and tosses a small pipelike device
inside He scurries away and we pan with him across the
street to reveal a line of cars police and civilian
parked along the far curb No men are visible except the
scurrying man who takes cover behind one of the parked
cars

SOCIAL CLUB
A beat From inside we hear a pair of trotting footsteps--

BOOM The window blows out spitting glass into the
street along with a large dark form

THE STREET

Glass showers the pavement and a charred rag-doll of a body
hits hard face down and skids a couple feet Smoke wisps
from it

THE CLUB

A lick of flame from the bomb is already dying and heavy
grey smoke is billowing out

THE STREET
Men start cautiously rising from behind the cars A lot of
men Some wear police uniforms some are civilians All
are armed

THE CLUB

Billowing smoke

THE STREET

The men have straightened up A policeman calls through a
bullhorn

Policeman

All right Anyone left in there come on out

grabbing air You know the drill
THE CLUB
After a beat the front door swings open A man emerges
one hand in the air one holding a handkerchief over his
mouth
He walks into the middle of the street

One of the civilians behind the cars fires

The man takes the bullet in the chest and drops to the
ground where he twitches

The man who fired in the foreground grins A ripple of
laughter runs down the line of men

THE CLUB WINDOW

Smoke still pouring out

With a RAT-A-TAT-TAT muzzle flashes from inside illuminate
the smoke

THE STREET

Bullet hits chew up the cars and a few of the men the

others drop back down behind the cars and start returning
fire

THE WINDOW
A forbidding black hole in the exterior wall A second

tommy has joined the first to pour lead out into the
street

INT MAYORS OFFICE

A grand high-ceilinged place Mayor Levander sits behind
his desk sputtering his face turning purple Caspar
sitting across from him is also turning purple Sitting
to one side are two identical thirty-year-old men appar-
ently twins mustachiced silent respectful mournful
their hands clasped over the hats in their laps wearing
stiff new-looking suits with old-fashioned collars

Mayor

Why it simply isnt done Assistants maybe--

Caspar
For a mayor you dont hear so hot I said head
Head of the assessors office

Mayor

Caspar

Mayor

countless occasions--

Caspar
Damn right--had every potato eater from County
Cork an the public tit--

Mayor
But theres a way we do things hallowed by usage
and consecrated by time When we put people on
the pad when Leo was running things we--

Caspar is furious

Caspar

ancient history Im running things now

Mayor
Johnny no one appreciates that more than I I

I can even give them jobs where thev wont have
to perform any work where their lack of English
will be no impediment But I cant--

Caspar
What is this the high hat

The mayor mops his face with a handkerchief and looks
beseechingly at Tom

Mayor
Tom can you explain it to him I can put them
in public works but I cant--

Tom
You can do whatever the hell Caspar tells you I
dont remember all this double-talk when Leo gave
you an order

The mayor looks flabbergasted

Mayor

Tom
Stop whimpering and do as youre told

Caspar
You can start by gettin outta here

Mayor
But Johnny its my office

Caspar
Get outta here Take it on the heel and toe
before I whack you one

The mayor retreats and Casmar stares at the two men sitting
to the side

You too beat it
The two men look at each other then back at Caspar

First Man
Partiamo

Caspar
Yeah go keep the mayor company Ill take care
of yas later

The immigrants rise and leave the room Caspar takes out a
handkerchief and wipes his brow

Runnin things It aint all gravy
The secretary enters the office with a bottle of whiskey a
soda siphon and ice She places it an the mayors desk and

leaves

We can still hear faint gunfire and an occasional booming
explosion that rattles the windows of the office
Tom
Whats the fireworks

Caspar
Knockin over one of Leos clubs Sonofabitch
just wont go belly-up Im sorry kid I

heard about your little ride this morning
Tom is walking over to pour himself a drink

Tom
Yeah well sorry dont fix things We could just
as easilyve missed Bernies corpse as stumbled
over it and Id be dead now

Caspar
I know I know But it dont mean Bluepoints up
to anything So he heard some rumor Bernie aint
dead those stories pop up people seen Dillinger
in eight states last week So he hears a story
and he dont like you much anyway so he decides
to check it out--

Tom
Any stories about Bernie being alive Bluepoints
made up himself

Caspar
Aw you dont know that It dont even make
sense--why would he

Tom stares at Caspar for a beat

Tom
There could be a damn good reason

Caspar squints at Tom

If youve got a fixed fight coming up Do
you

Caspar
Maybe Okay yeah sure Tomorrow night
the fix is in What of it

Tom
Bluepoint knows about it

Caspar
Yeah

He gazes off
Okay I get it

Tom
If Bluepoints been selling you out on these
fights and means to again hell have to be able
to point the finger at someone else--

Uncomfortably

Caspar
Yeah yeah I get it

Tom
--but with Bernie dead there aint a hell of a
lot of people he can point to

Caspar
Yeah Bluepoint sells me out Makes pretend
Bernies still doin it Ats real pretty
Bernie leaked the fix and you take the fall for
supposedly not killing him

He leans back in the mayors chair and gazes off sucking
his lips in and out as he thinks Finally

But I dunno why would Bluepoint cross me
like that Money okay everybody likes money
But somehow it dont seem like him And I know
the Bluepoint

Tom
Nobody knows anybody Not that well

Caspar shakes his head

Caspar
Money dont mean that much to him

Tom shrugs

Tom
Then its not just money hes after Hes got a
wart on his fanny

Caspar
Huh

Tom
A wart On his fanny Giving him the fidgets
Maybe hes sick of sitting on the couch and maybe
behind your desk dont look like a bad place to
move to Maybe he figures the money can help
move him there

Caspar studies Tom

Caspar
Kid you got a lip on ya

He looks off again

I dont generally care for it But youre
honest and thats something we cant get enough
of in this business Ill admit since last
we jawed my stomachs been seazin up on me
Bluepoint saying we should double-cross you you
double-cross once wheres it all end An
innaresting ethical question Ill find Blue-
point talk to him straighten it out--

Tom laughs bitterly

Tom
Sure talk to him Have a chat Ask him whether
hes selling you out Dont take care of him
before he makes his next move just sit back and
let him make it Youre swimmin in it

Caspars eyes flash Toms tone softens

Johnny my chins hanging out right along
side yours

Caspar goes slack

Caspar

Tom stands up

Tom

worrying enough

Caspar miserable rubs his face From the distant street
we hear another booming explosion

Caspar
But I am kid Christ running
things
CUT TO
TOMS APARTMENT

The phone is ringing at the cut

We are looking at the window sill upon which the phone
sits with an empty chair facing

Footsteps approach and Tom sits into frame and takes the
phone

Tom
Yeah

Through the phone

Voice
I got your message

Tom
Lo Bernie I had a dream about you the other
day
We hear Bernie laugh
Bernie

Yeah A nightmare

Tom
On the contrary very sweet I dreamt you were
lying out at Millers Crossing with your face
blown off

More laughter

Bernie
You get a kick out of that

Tom
I was in stitches Its Mink isnt it

Bernie
I came back and he wasnt happy to see me Can
you beat that Tom All he could taik about was
how he had to skip and how much trouble hed be
in if anyone found me at his place

Tom
Some friend

Bernie
Yeah And you know what a nervous boy he was I
figured hell youre a friend Maybe you could
use some insurance

Tom

After a moments hesitation

Bernie
Held already ditched it Why

Another hesitation

Down

Tom

Bernie

Tom

thinking about our little deal and Ive decided

Bernie
Huh

Tom
I figure you dont have anything on me that I
dont have on you As a matter of fact less
since Ive decided to leave town So Im calling
your bluff

Bernie
Wait a minute--

Tom
Shutup and let me talk Im pulling out of here
tomorrow morning The only thing for you to
decide is whether or not I leave behind a message
for Caspar that youre still around If you want
me to keep my mouth shut itll cost you some
dough

Bernie
You cant--
Tom
I figure a thousand bucks is reasonable So I
want two thousand

Bernie
In a pigs eye--
Tom
This isnt a debate its instructions Im

going out for a while Ill be back here at four
this morning Bring me the money If youre not
at my place four oclock with the dough
Casparll be looking for you tomorrow

He hangs up

CUT TO
HALLWAY

We are close on Tom as in overcoat and hat he emerges
from his apartment and looks down at the keys in his hand

WHAP--A fist swings into frame to connect with Toms cheek
He falls back

Three topcoated men loom over him

First Man
Got any money

Tom is massaging his face

Tom
No

The first man nods at the other two

First Man
Okay

The two men pick Tom off the floor and start to work him
over He doesnt resist

The first man watches dispassionately

Third race tonight By the finish Tailor
Maid had a view of the field

He lights himself a cigarette

You oughta lay off the ponies Tom

The two men work in silence for a while Tom too is
silent

Finally
Okay

The two men back away from Tom breathing heavily He
slides down the wall to the floor

Lazarre said hes sorry about this Its
just getting out of hand

Tom speaks thickly his head propped against the baseboard

Tom
Yeah

First Man
He likes you Tom He said we didnt have to
break anything

Tom
Yeah Okay Tell him no hard feelings

First Man
Christ Tom he knows that

With a jerk of the head the first man signals the other two
and the trio turns to leave

First Man
Take care now

CUT TO
DOORWAY NIGHT

We are looking over Toms shoulder as he waits in the rain
in front of a large oak doorway with wrought-iron fretwork
At the cut we hear chimes dying and the door swings open

There is a grand foyer with a parquet floor unsittable
furniture and a large chandelier A liveried butler looks
inquiringly out at Tom

Tom
Tom Duchaisne
Butler
Yes sir

He steps back
Mr Caspar is in the great room
Tom is handing the butler his hat
Tom
Swell Can you take this
INT FOYER

As Tom starts to shrug out of his coat Caspar is crossing
towards him

Caspar
Kid whats the rumpus

Caspar seems as unhappy as last time we saw him

Tom
I got news

Caspar
Yeah news at this end too My stomachs been
seazin up on me

Tom
Mink just told me that he--

This has woken Caspar up

Caspar
You talked to Mink

Tom
Yeah on the phone Bluepoint wants you to think
hes dissappeared so you cant talk to him but
hes been right here in town

Caspar
Youre sure it was Mink

Tom shrugs
Tom

See for yourself hes coming to my place four
oclock this morning

Having handed the butler his coat and hat Tom lets Caspar
lead him towards a pair of double doors

oe Hes afraid of a cross from Bluepoint He

told me about the fix Says hell sing for a

couple grand skip money tell us everyone

involved
Caspar opens one of the double doors and we continue
tracking behind the two men as they enter the trophy room
The room has the low warm light of a mens club Outside
the dark windows the rain sheets down
Caspar sits in behind his desk and swivels away to poke
morosely with a fire shovel at the blaze in the fireplace
In the foreground back to us Tom rests his knuckles an
the desk to lean towards Caspar

But you better take care of Bluepoint right

away Mink says if he comes after us its going

to be tonight
As he looks into the fire

Caspar
Leos holed up at Whiskey Nicks dump

Tom is momentarily taken aback

Tom
How dyou know

A chuckle comes from behind

REVERSE

On Tom In the background Bluepoint is walking over to
the door to the room to close it

Bluepoint
That aint all we know smart guy

He points with a nod towards the couch
Recognize your playmate

On the couch sits Drop Johnson Drops face looks worked
on and is beaded over with sweat

Having shut the door Bluepoint is sauntering over to Tom
Yeah You thought Id quit
He shakes his head
Huh-uh I followed you this afternoon And I
wondered why Einstein would want to talk to a
gorilla

He is nose to nose with Tom smiling at him

So I grabbed the gorilla And I beat it
out of him

He shrugs

Give me a big guy every time They crack
easy Not like you

Tom holds Bluepoints look

Tom
Is there a point Or are you just brushing up on
your small talk

Bluepoint
I like that Cool under fire Im impressed

Very quickly he delivers two slaps--forehand and backhand
Toms head rocks but he recovers to stare back at Blue-
point

The gorilla didnt know whose stiff we
found but I can fill that in You killed Mink
you sonofabitch

He grabs Tom by the lapels swings him away from the desk
and lands a punch on his chin

Tom stumbles backs

Caspar has turned from the fireplace watching the doings
across the room

Bluepoint moves towards Tom breathing hard with antici-
pated pleasure

Come here bum Im gonna send you to a
deep dark place And Im gonna have fun doing
it

Bluepoints hand snakes out and grabs Tom by the front of
the coat hauling him close He slaps him savagely
It was Mink and by God Ill hear you say
Tom

Is this how you taught Drop his story
In one motion Bluepoints hands wrap around Toms throat
choking him off As the pressure increases Tom purpling
sinks to his knees

Bluepoint
I like the way you think Maybe when youre dead
Ill cut your head off put it on my mantle--

WHANG--a shovel blade swings into frame to smash Bluepoint
in the face

He drops
From somewhere in the room a scream

Bluepoint is on his hands and knees one hand pressed over
his ruined face blood pouring from between the fingers

Caspar
Sonafabitch

He stands over Bluepoint with the fireplace shovel
If theres one thing I cant stand its a
double-cross artist I had a feeling bout this

sonofabitch--

He swings the shovel back and delivers an overhand blow to
the top of Bluepoints head

Bluepoint drops to the floor instantly motionless

The scream however continues

Drop Johnson on the couch his eyes wide his hands
spastically squeezing his knees is looking down at
Bluepoint Drops mouth is stretched wide He is scream-
ing

Tom gets slowly to his feet

Cascar looks at Drop

Shut it you sonofabitch
He is striding over to him with the shovel
Ill give you something to holler about
Tom intercepts him
Tom
Johnny Its okay Bluepoint made him Its
okay Its not important

Caspar is panting

Caspar
Then have him shut it

Drop does
There is a beat
Incongruously Caspars bellow breaks the silence

And we do the same to Mink This very same
night

Another silence The rain The crackle of the fire
Toms tone is soothing
Tom
Johnny We cant double-cross him He
wants to spill the whole set-up--

Caspar stares at him through glazed eyes

Caspar
Ive never let a sonofabitch walk

Tom
Youve never crossed anyone

Caspar is staring at him His eyes have lost some of their
glaze

Tom
Four oclock my place Minks coming in
on his own hook so I promised him the money
Dont make me out a liar--

Drop is suddenly screaming again

Caspar looks where Drop is looking

Bluepoint is raising his head moaning His face is a mask
of blood One hand gropes in his overcoat pocket for his
gun

Caspar shouts over Drops howl as he pulls something from
his desk drawer

Caspar
Lookit this kid

He strides over to Bluepoint
Something I try and teach all my boys

With the gun point blank against the back of Bluepoints
head he fires

Tom recoils

Always put one inna brain

A CLOCK
A large wall clock It is 330

We are pulling back and down to reveal that we are inside a
diner we are isolating on a section of counter on which
sits a half-empty cup of coffee and an ashtray half-filled
with butts A hand puts some change on the counter and
leaves frame

EXT DINER

As Tom pushes the door open and exits He tucks his
overcoat collar up as he walks it is pouring rain

Tom turns at the sound of approaching heels and recognizes
Verna with some surprise He glances up and down the
street but it is deserted Verna doesnt seem to much
notice the rain

Tom
Lo Verna Whats the rumpus

Coldly as they walk on together
Verna

I was just in the neighborhood feeling a little
daffy Whatre you doing
Tom
Walking

Verna
Dont let on more than you have to

Tom
In the rain

Tom glances at her
Whatre you doing out

Verna
Bernies dead isnt he

They walk on for a beat Tom looking down at the sidewalk
Finally

Tom
What makes you think that

Verna
Thats no answer

Tom again glances around and escorts Verna into a dark
doorway alcove It is very small they have to crowd into
each other to stay out of the rain Water drops from the
brim of Toms fedora He studies her for a beat

Tom
I cant tell you anything yet

Verna
Nobody cares do they His friends didnt really
like him
Tom shrugs
Tom

He didnt like his friends

Verna
Youre a sonofabitch Tom Youre someone to
talk You got me to tell you where he was and
then you killed him

She is raising a gun into frame She presses it into his
stomach

Tom stiffens but continues to stare at her calmly
Tell me why What was in it for you

Tom
Nothing for me

Verna
Then why

Tom

Giving up Bernie was the only way I could
see to straighten things out for Leo

Verna
You said you didnt care about Leo

Tom
I said we were through Its not the same thing

Verna looks at him
Verna
I dont understand I dont care I dont

care what reason you had or thought you had

She raises the gun and presses its barrel into the under-
side of Toms chin Tom stiffens but remains calm

Tom
Hes still alive

Verna stares at him

Verna
You expect me to believe you

Tom
No

Verna
Thats you all over Tom A lie and no heart

Verna pulls back the hammer There is a long beat
Vernas eves widen locked an Toms

Tom returns her look his is sympathetic

Verna starts trembling

Toms tone is soft understanding Its the first time we
have ever seen compassion from him
Tom
It isnt easy is it Verna

She abruptly lurches away and staggers a couple of paces
onto the sidewalk in the rain She hugs a lamppost for
support She is staring down at the street still trem-
bling

Tom walks up behind her and rests a hand an her shoulder
Are you all right
She doesnt look around After a moment

Verna
I dont know how you did it

She shrugs off his hand and stumbles off down the street

Tom watches her dissappear into the rain

CUT TO
TREE LIMBS

Night but sometime later--it has stopped raining The
branches groan in the wind As they sway streetlight
glitters off the leaves still wet with rain

We are booming down to reveal that we are in front of Toms
building its windows dark During the boom we hear the
rumble of an approaching car and the hiss of its tires on
wet asphalt

The boom down ends as the car pulls into frame to stop at
the curb with the camera framed on the drivers window
The driver has a small bandage on his left cheek We hear
Caspars voice as we hear him getting out the back

Caspar
Ya put the razor in cold water not hot--cause
metal does what in cold

Driver
I dunno Johnny

We hear the back door slam and Caspar appears in the front
passenger window

Ats what Im tellin ya It contracts

At way you get a first class shave

Driver
Okay Johnny

As Caspar walks off the driver slouches back pulls his
fedora over his eyes and folds his arms across his chest

A back enters frame in the foreground

Toms Voice
Lo Sal You can dangle

The driver looks up startled

Driver
Lo Tom You sure You dont look so hot

We still dont see Toms face

Tom
Im okay Go ahead Ill drive him home

The driver shrugs

REVERSE

Wider from the other side of the car as the car pulls
away

Tom walks into the foreground toward his house we tilt up
to hold him

The low-angle shows us the tree behind Tom its branches
still creaking in the wind

Crack crack--we hear two gunshots from inside the house
Tom stops momentarily in close shot looking up and then
continues on out of frame

OVER TOMS SHOULDER

We follow him as he walks into the building and slowly down
the first-floor hall

The hallway is quiet excent for a light moaning wind

Beyond Tom we see the door to the first-floor apartment
crack open a slit Hissing
Voice
Mr Duchaisne

The door opens wider Mrs Zarpmas wearing a housecoat
her gray hair down in braids sticks her head out

There were shots

Tom looks up towards the staircase then back at Mrs
Zarpas

Tom
Go down to the drugstore Call the police

She stares at him nods As she drapes on a raincoat

Mrs Zarpas
Yes Mr Duchaisne

Tom
You better stay there til the officers arrive

Mrs Zarpas
Yes

She pauses

Will the cats be all right here
Tom stares at her
Finally he nods

Tom
Theyll be fine

Mrs Zarpas returns his dazed nod and shuffles away

So far upstairs all is quiet

PULLING TOM

As he starts slowly towards the staircase

TOMS POV TRACKING FORWARD

A small black object on the staircase--an upside-down
fedora Blood drips with a hollow rattle down onto a step
a couple steps above the hat
PULLING TOM

He looks up

POV

A head sticks through the balusters of the second story
landing return The body is on its back the head lolls
back over the tip of the landing down towards the stair-
case

Our climbing low angle shows us mostly the back of the
head The bodys far shoulder has knocked out a baluster
whose splintered bottom juts down towards the stairs

PULLING TOM

Still climbing looking at the body

HIS POV

Climbing and panning as we draw even with the head

It is Caspar Blood has been expelled through his nostrils
over his mouth and chin His face is deep red His eyes
stare glassily at Tom

PULLING TOM

As he reaches the top of the stairs and swings around to
face along the landing We hear a chuckle close by Wind
is groaning through the hallway

POV

In the middle foreground Caspar lies an the floor beyond
him Bernie leans against the doorframe in Toms open

doorway smiling his arms folded over his chest

The balusters stretch away in a regular line throwing
vertical shadows upwards against the opposite wall

Bernie
I get it You set me up

Tom leans against the wall and looks morosely down at
Caspar

Bernie
Anything to avoid a little dirty work
yourself huh

Tom doesnt answer

Howd you know held get it and not me Or
didnt you care

Tom shrugs still staring down at Caspar

Tom
I figured youd come early and be looking for
blood He wouldnt so youd likely have the
drop on him

Bernie takes his gun out of his overcoat packet and
saunters over

Bernie
Youre a sonofabitch Tom I like the way you
think Youre right the bonehead never knew
what hit him

He looks down at Caspar unable to supress a smile

But if you knew Id come looking to kill
you how do you know I wont still

Tom shrugs again
Tom
Nothing in it for you now With him dead we got

nothing on each other Let me have the gun

Bernie
Why

Tom jerks his head towards Caspar

Tom
Pin this on Bluepoint Neither of us wants him
walking around after this

Bernie shakes his head

Bernie

The copsll be Leos now They wont care what
they hang Bluepoint for

Tom shrugs again

Tom
I guess thats so If you dont mind keeping the
gun that killed Caspar And Mink

He stoops down over Caspars body and starts feeling
through Caspars pockets looking for something

Why did Mink shoot Rug anyway

Bernie is walking towards him emptying the bullets from
his gun

Bernie
I dunno it was just a mix-up Here

Tom looks back over his shoulder Bernie hands him the
gun which Tom slips into his overcoat packet

So youre gonna say Bluepoint did this
As he goes back to the body

Tom
Mink thought Rug was tailing him

He finds Caspars gun and sets it on the floor but keeps
looking

Bernie
Yeah yeah you know Mink Hysterical Skin full
of hop head full of bogeymen Comes home crying
one day said he had to pop a guy one of
Bluepoints spies

Tom
Rug was following Verna not Mink Mink just
happened to be with her

He has found a wallet and is thumbing through it

Bernie
Yeah Funny aint it But you know Mink was
terrified Bluepointd find out me and him were
jungled up together

Tom has taken out the money rifles it and replaces the
wallet

Tom
And Ill bet youd kept him plenty worried about
that to keep him under your thumb

Bernie
Yeah so what

Bernie is peering over Toms shoulder at the monev
Scratch huh A little bonus
Tom straightens up Caspars gun in hand

Tom
Why did Mink take Rugs hair

Bernie shrugs
Bernie
Beats me the kid was dizzy Fifty-fifty on the
dough Or maybe I should get a little more
since I did the deed
Tom is stuffing the money into his pocket

Okay you keep it I want you to have it

Tom
Bernie

He nods towards Caspars body
We cant hang this on Bluepoint

Bernie
Huh Why not

Tom
Bluepoints already dead halfway cross town

Bernies smile is fading

Bernie
What the hell are you talking about

Tom
Bluepoints dead Its gotta be you I mean
hell its your gun

Alarm is beginning to rise
Bernie

What is this What the hell are you talking
about
He looks down at Caspar and then back at Tom

You took my gun Just your word against

mine

Tom pops the chamber of Caspars gun glances in
it shut

Tom
Not necessarily

Bernies eyes widen
Bernie
Are you crazy Were square You said it

yourself We got nothing on each other

Tom
Yup

Bernie fights against hysteria
Bernie
So whats in it for you Theres no angle

cant just shoot me like that

He sinks to his knees his voice rising

and

You

Jesus Christ It dont make sense Tommy

Look in your heart

Tom
What heart

BANG--Bernie splays backwards from the knees a bullet

drilled neatly through his forehead

Tom drops the gun by Caspars body

Unpocketing Bernies gun Tom goes over to his corpse

drops it there

We pan with Toms legs to bring his doorway into view
walks into his apartment to the window chair in the

background and sits with his back to us

The windows show daylight breaking Far away a clock

strikes the quarter hour

Tom is picking up the phone and dialing Waiting for
answer he reaches over to turn off the feeble yellow

snaps

and

as he

an
lamp

burning chairside

As we start to FADE OUT we can hear Tom talking into the
phone

Tom
Tony Tom Tell Lazarre Ive got his
money Yeah all of it And I want to place

a bet on tonights fight

A BEAT OF BLACK

CUT TO
THE HALLWAY

Of Leos club leading to his office

We are tracking over Toms shoulder as he walks down the
hall led by Dead Terry

Terry
They set you up downstairs

Tom
Hows that

Terry
Hootch Whatever

Tom gestures with the drink he is carrying Its ice cubes
clink

Well thanks for coming Tom Leos real
anxious to see you

Tom
Yeah I happened to be near

We can hear muffled bellowing coming from Leos office
growing louder as we approach

Terry seems embarassed

Terry
Actually this might not be the best time

They have pulled up in front of the closed door to Leos
office

Leos bellowing inside abates for a moment We can hear
another voice muffled so that we dont hear words but
only the voices plaintive quality

Leos bellowing cuts it short

Tom
Whos he got in there

Terry
OGar and the mayor

As he leaves frame

Tom
Ill try again

Terry calls after him

Terry
Ill tell him you stopped by

DOWNSTATRS

Pulling Tom as he walks across the gambling floor drink
still in hand

Behind him we can see workmen busily repairing the damage
done to the club in the police raid

Halfway across the floor Tom stiffens and slows seeing
something

Verna is entering the club
The two meet

Tom
Lo Verna

Verna
See Leo

They both lean against a counterstop and look out at the
floor

Tom
He was busy

Verna
You should see him He has something to tell
you

Tom
Maybe Ill run into him

Verna
Bernies funeral is tomorrow You could stop by

Tom
Maybe

Verna
Leo has something to tell you

Tom
So you said

There is a silent beat Verna scowls
Verna
Tell me something Tom Why didnt you
tell me what was going on I thought he was
dead and you never--
Tom
There was no point in telling you It could only
have queered things if it had gotten out--
Verna
Jesus Tom You dont just talk to people for
the play it gives you or doesnt give you I
suffered you no-heart son of a bitch
Tom lets this drift
Verna tries to compose herself
Im sorry Its just that things mightve
been different With us If Id known that you
hadnt done anything to him

Tom
You know now

Verna looks at him intently

Verna
What happened that night

Tom still looks at her evenly

Tom

I went to a bar Passed out When I got back to
my place they were both dead

Verna studies him

Verna
Passed out huh

Tom
Yeah

She looks at him a beat more then out at the floor
Verna
Its funny Ive never even seen you sleep--

though you told me once about a dream you had

Tom
Maybe I lied

WHAP Verna slaps him hard His head rocks under the
blow

Verna
Youve never been straight with me about any-
thing You are a sonofabitch
She stalks off
Tom watches her go

He raises the drink and rolls it across his slapped cheek

The ice cubes clink

CEMETARY

An small old marble orchard set on a hilltop cleared
against the woods Stars of David adorn the headstones in
the foreground Bernies funeral is ending Present is a
rabbi just finishing the chanting of the liturgy Verna
and Leo

In the background on the road at the foot of the hill Tom
is emerging from a taxi It rolls away as he starts up the
hill

Just as he arrives Leo and Verna turn to leave

Tom takes in the scene
Tom
Big turnout

Verna
Drop dead

She stalks off leaving Leo and Tom alone Leo takes off
his yarmulke and fiddles with it uncomfortably The two

men start walking

Leo
Shes under a lot of strain

Tom
Well at least she didnt hit me

Leo chuckles
They walk on

Leo
Tommy Im glad you came

Tom
Shes taking the car

Leo
Huh

Leo looks up

Verna is getting into the elegant black touring-car that
waits at the bottom of the hill It pulls away

Leo looks at Tom
I guess were walking

Tom
I guess we are

They walk in silence for a beat

Leo
Were getting married

Tom stiffens He brings out

Tom
Congratulations Leo

Leo too is uncomfortable
Leo
The funny thing is She asked me To tie the
knot I guess youre not supposed to say that

Tom
It doesnt matter Congratulations

Leo
Thanks Hell Tom Why didnt you tell me
what you were up to I thought youd really
gone over--not that I didnt deserve it But you
could have told me
Tom
Telling you could onlyve queered things if it
had
Tom cuts himself off and walks in silence for a moment
There just wasnt any point
Leo wants to be encouraging He nods
Leo
I can see that Well It was a smart play all

around I guess you know Im grateful

Tom
No need

Leo is grinning again
Leo
I guess you picked that fight with me just to
tuck yourself in with Caspar
Tom
I dunno Do you always know why you do things
Leo

Leo greets this with a puzzled Smile

Leo
Course I do

He nods to himself
It was a smart play

They walk on
Tom
Youll do fine

Leo stops grabs Toms arm and the words come cut ina
rush

Leo

Jesus Tom Id give anything if youd
work for me again I know Ive made some
bonehead plays I know I can be pig-headed but
damnit so can you I need your help and things
can be like they were I know it I just know
it As for you and Verna--well I understand
youre both young and--well damnit Tom I
forgive you

Tom instantly bristles For the first time his tone is
sharp

Tom
I didnt ask for that and I dont want it

fq

The two men stare at each other--Toms look angry Leos
distraught

Toms look softens
Goodbye Leo
Leo still stares at him waiting for something else

When nothing is forthcoming he turns and walks away

fq

om watches him go He unpockets a flask and raises it to
his lips

Behind him a tree soughs in the wind

FADE OUT
