THEN SUDDENLY the Number takes an acute change Dancers
begin disrobing the first being Victoria Hecht stares at
Victoria his face red with embarrassment

HECHT
Whats going on

CHRISTOPHER
(similarly embarrassed)
I think theyre taking off their
clothes

Both are now riveted by the sight of a boy dancer disrobing

DANN
Jesus Christ

Soon the entire company has disrobed The boy dancers wear
only dance belts (with hats on their heads of course) The
girls wear only a minimum of clothing

Its apparent that Joe has decided that the theme of the
Number is “Casual or indifferent sexual encounters in
contempora society People meet -- have sex -- separate
without a residue or even memory of relationship ‘There are
various mechanical sex couplings every variation of girls and

boys - boys and boys -- girls and girls -- in threes and fours
- and so on and so on

This is certainly not what the “jury” had expected Shock
confusion bewilderment read very clearly on their faces
The Number finishes with all the dancers in isolated areas

caressing only themselves loving only themselves incapable

of making contact with any other person There is nothing left
but self-love
