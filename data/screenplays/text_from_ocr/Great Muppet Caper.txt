Inside a circle in the center of the brightly colored
movie screen ANIMALS PACE APPEARS His eyes dart
from side to side as if hes looking at the audience
then he suddenly roars in the manner of the MGM Lion
Following the initial roar he snarls a couple more
times then proceeds to eat the screen chomping away
huge sections one bite a a time until hes devoured
Dragging down the last morsel Animal drops
out of the picture leaving behind nothing but a bright
blue sky

Ext SKY- DAY

Ever so slowly a hot air balloon drifts across the
screen like a speck on the horizon and APPROPRIATE
SOARING DRIFTING BALLOON MUSIC is heard Through a
series of DISSOLVES as the balloon gets a bit closer

Photo of Xermit and Fozzie Almost immediately the
Photo which is on the front pase of a newspaver is ha
Slammed onto a desk The man who is doing slamming is
MIKE TARKANIAN City Editor of the Daily Chronicle and
he is livid with rage The veins in his neck stand

out as he berates Kermit Fozzie and Gonzo who tremble
in fear in front of his desk During his tirade
Tarkanian pounds his fist on the desk for emphasis
Each impact causes the three Muppets to jump in the air

TARKANIAN
How could you misa a story like
that Right in front of your
noses It practically bit you
on tha seats of your pants
Theres no excuse

FOzzI
I guess this would be the wrong
time to ask for a raise

“TARKANIAN
Ill give you a raiset

He slams his fist on the desk again sending the Muppets
three faet into the air

GONZO
anjoying it)
Wheeee

They hit the ground with a thud

And last but not least heres our
cute little banner story

He throws a copy of the Chronicle on top of the other
papers The headline says “Identical Twins Join the
Chronicle Steff above a poorly composed picture of
Kermit and Fozzie posing in the street

TARKANIAN
(continued)
“Identical Twins Join the Chronicle
Staff Now which paper would you
buy

FOZZIE

Tarkanian slams his fist again in exasperation and the
Muppets are again propelled into the air
GONZO
Yahooo

Kermit and Fozzie hit the floor in a heap Gonzo hangs

from a light fixture

KERMIT
Giving us concussions isnt the
answer Mr Tarkanian We thought
identical twins working on a news-
paper would make an interesting story

TARKANIAN
Well it doesnt Especially since
you guys dont look anything alike

KERMIT
Thats because Fozzie’s wearing
his hat
to Pozzie)

Take it off Pozz
Fegzie removes his hat

TARKANIAN
Oh yeah Now I see it But
thats no excuse for blowing the

story
FOZZIE
Well do better next time
TARKANIAN
(incredulously)

Next time Next time What
makes you think theres gonna be
next time

KERMIT
If there isnt its gonna be a
“veal short movie

TARKANIAN
The only reason I hired you two
jerks in the first place was
because your old man was a friend
of mine

He indicates a picture of himself with his arm around
green bear -

KERMIT
Dad spoke well of you too

FOZZIE
We have that same picture in our
living room

TARKANIAN
Well Im as sentimental as the next

A JET DIMINISHES in the distance

EXT ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

Within a few seconds three cages containing Kermit
Fozzie and-Gonzo splash down in the pond spraying
water on the birdwatcher who takes the binoculars

The three Muppets bobbing up and down on top of the
water peer at the man and think they recognize him
but cant be sure In truth hes JIM HENSON in his
motion picture debut looking a little silly in tweed
knickers Kermit Fozzie and Gonzo stare at him
incredulouslythen-lookat each other quizzically
then back at Jim

JIM

The three Muppets land on the sidewalk as the bus
speeds away

KERMIT
Im getting a little tired of
making crash landings

Gonzo
I like it But then Im nuts

The exterior of the hotel could be described as
ramshackle at best It looks as out of place in London
as Eva Peron did during her ill-fated visit som years
back If there is a neon sign letters are missing

If there is a flag its torn If there are windows
most are broken If there are doors they are warped
If the facade is painted the colors are faded

xXERT
(reading a chipped
sign)
Happiness Hotel Its weird
but its cheap” Sounds perfect

FOZZIE

If this is the Happiness Hotel
I wonder what the sad one looks
like

INT HAPPINESS HOTEL KERMITS ROOM - NIGHT 17

Kermit Fozzie and Gonzo stand in the middle of their
meager living quarters in silence their luggage
tossed carelessly on the floor

Their room® is barely that -- its more like a cubicle
containing only a bed a bare light bulb suspended

from the ceiling and a single broken window overlooking
the street where a dull amber gaslight offers a little

additional illumination

GONZO

Not bad

of the room)

groups

They climb into the bed

XERMIT
Well have breakfast in the

be thankful were here

Just then the bed slams up into the wall with the
three Muppets inside save for a hand a foot a tuft
of hair sticking out from the top and sides

Nobody can of course but after a couple of seconds

INT LADY HOLIDAYS OFFICE - DAY 1s

In the beautifully appointed luxurious office of LADY
HOLIDAY the stylish matron is at her desk talking into
one of a bank of telephones while three exquisitely
dressed and coiffed models CARLA MARLA AND DARLA
wait patiently in exaggerated model poses

LADY HOLIDAY

(into phone)
No -darling you must call the --
United States and tell Vogue they
cant have the pictures of the
spring line until after the show
Im not too happy with some of the
designsI still have to make some
changes

mistakesof course Paris should

be notified0h thank you
darlingyes Im fineI had

quite a scareI wasnt hurt

valuable All my diamonds are

valuable

She hangs up the phone then rises and walks around the
models studying them To the untrained eye they look
like a million bucks but to Lady Holiday they look
considerably less expensive

LADY HOLIDAY
Carlathe neckline on that gown
is tee high dont you think

CARLA

in the shoulders and the hipsI dont
‘think we should strive for the sway-
backed mule look do you And Darla
that outfit’s the pits Loose where
it should be tight tight where it
should be loose Like folds on a
turkey neck TI must be getting senile
“Why would I design such atrocious
looking clothing

She dismisses them with a wave of her hand Marla and
Darla EXIT as Lady Holiday pushes the button of the
intercom on her desk

VOICE ON INTERCOM (0S)

INT LADY HOLIDAYS OFFICE - DAY 20

Miss Piggy looks calm and efficient for a beat then
unable to contain herself any longer leaps once mora
for joy Screaming her happiness After letting it
sink in for a moment she sees herself in a mirror and
she and her mirror image sing a duet about her good
fortune and the opportunity she has

MISS PIGGY
Could I take the first step
Could I open the door
Could I learn to be somacne
Who I wasnt before
Is there somebody here
Who I never could see
- Could it be me

Could I change how I feel
Learn to laugh and to cry
Could I walk in the sun
Could I reach to the sky
Someone must know the place
Ive been longing to be

- Could it be ma

Telling my story
Singing my song

So everyone will hear
Not just for the glory
But to grow and go on
An to try again

- Starting here

Could I make my way through
Break away from the past

‘Til the dreams have come true
And I know they can last

Is there somebody new

Wholl be there when Im free
- Could it be me

- Could it be me

Cleaning establishment The
location seemed perfect didnt it
Foot traffic and highway traffic all
day long No other cleaner in the
Neighborhood You needed extra
equipment so you went into hock
Business fall off as synthetics
glutted the clothing market Your
brother-in-law doesnt bother to show
up all the time and your sister starts
accusing you o£ trying to run the
businesa Another cleaner opens
down the street and hes charging
less and getting the Jeb done faster
because hes got more help Your
brother-in-law wants you to buy him
out because hes fed up and your kids
are getting older and they never see
you and are turning into juvenile
dalinquents and your wife says you
care more about the lousy dry Cleaning
business than you do about her and
your equipment breaks down and your
sister moves in with you because your
rotten brother-in-law joins the circus
and youve had it up to here and you
Cant stand it anymore So you sell
the business for a song to the slob down
the street whos been trying to bury you
for years and you sink what little money
you have left into the glass slipper
