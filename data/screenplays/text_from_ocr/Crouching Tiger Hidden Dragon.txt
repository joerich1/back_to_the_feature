YU
Why Youre a Wudan fighter
Training is everything

LI
During my meditation training I
came to a place of deep silence
I was surrounded by light Time
and space disappeared I had come
to a place my master had never told
me about

YU
You were enlightened
LI
No I didnt feel the bliss of
enlightenment Instead I was
surrounded by an endless sorrow I
couldnt bear it I broke off my
meditation I couldnt go on
There was something pulling me
back

YU
What was it

LI
Something I cant let go of You

YU
Were preparing a convoy for a

Perhaps I could ask you to deliver
something to Sir Te for me

beautiful sword

YU
The Green Destiny Sword Youre
giving it to Sir Te

LI
I am He has always been our
greatest protector

YU
I dont understand How can you
part with it It has always been
with you

LI
Too many men have died at its edge
It only looks pure because blood
washes so easily from its blade

YU
You use it justly youre worthy of
it

LI

Its time for me to leave it behind
YU
So what will you do now

Li doesnt reply

YU
Come with me to Peking You can
give the sword to Sir Te yourself

to avenge his death And yet Im
thinking of quitting I must pray
for his forgiveness

can wait for you in Peking

Yus daughter

DE LU
This is Sir Tes study You are
here to

JEN

was looking for a quiet corner

DE LU
am Sir Tes head servant And
this is another of our guests

INT TES STUDY - DAY

Yu gently lays the sword still in its sheath in Jens hands

JEN
Its heavy for such a thin piece of
metal

YU
The handle is heavy And the blade
is no ordinary metal Still the

sword is the lightest of weapons
Youre just not used to handling it

JEN
But I have had much practice Asa
child in the West a platoon lived
with us Theyd let me play with
their weapons The scabbard is so
beautiful

YU
Beautiful but dangerous Once you
see it tainted with blood its
beauty is hard to admire Its 400
years old

JEN
Exquisite You said it belongs to

YU
My friend Li Mu Bai Hes given it
to Sir Te as a gift

JEN
Li Mu Bai The famous warrior
Why would he give his sword to Sir
Te

YU
Youre too young to understand

JEN
Youre a sword fighter too

Yu yanks the sword out of the sheath An eerie sound
resonates within the study Jen is even more impressed

YU
Yes I am But I prefer the
machete Certain moves however

call for a sword

JEN
Really

Yu puts the sword back in the case

JEN
(longingly)
It must be exciting to be a fighter
to be totally free

YU
Fighters have rules too friendship
trust integrity Without rules

we wouldnt survive for long

JEN
Ive read all about people like you
Roaming wild beating up anyone who
gets in your way

YU
Writers wouldnt sell many books if
they told how it really is
JEN
But youre just like the characters
in the stories

YU
Sure No place to bathe for days
sleeping in flea-infested beds
They tell you all about that in
those books

JEN
You know what I mean Im getting
married soon but I havent lived
the life I want

YU
So I heard Congratulations Its
the most important step ina
womans life isnt it

JEN
Youre not married are you

YU
What do you think

JEN
No You couldnt roam around

freely if you were

YU
Youre probably right

Yu studies Jen The room falls silent for a moment

Its dusk and the sky is beautiful orange and purple Jen
is leaving the study escorted by her maid She turns to Yu
for a final good-bye Yu seems intrigued by the encounter
EXT SIR TES COMPOUND - NIGHT

Two lighted lanterns are raised up

INT TES STUDY - NIGHT

Sir Te hands the sword to Governor Yu

SIR TE
Go ahead Governor Yu
Governor Yu is impressed by the opulence and elegance of the
sword He closes his eyes to guess the weight of the sword
Te snubs out the flame from a candle then slides the sword
out from its sheath The sword gives off a luminous blue
glow in the dark

SIR TE
Two feet 9 inches long 1 inch
wide The handle is 1 inch deep
26 inches wide Seven-tenths of
an inch thick With seven rubies
missing from the hilt You can
tell the design dates back to
before the Chin era Engraved with
a technique lost by the time of the
Han Dynasty

GOVERNOR YU
Your knowledge is remarkable Sir Te

SIR TE
A sword by itself rules nothing
t comes alive only through skillful
manipulation

GOVERNOR YU
see your point Please continue

SIR TE

The Imperial Court isnt the
problem With royalty and officials
everywhere the Royal Guard keeps
security tight But Peking is not
like the West Here youll find
all sorts of characters Proceed
with caution in your quest for law
and order Dont depend only on
the court Contacts in the Giang
Hu underworld can ensure your
position Be strong yet supple
This is the way to rule

disguise and unveils herself -- the Governess

Li Mu Bai flies down from the treetops and steps between them

FOX
Tsai you filthy mongrel An ambush
MAY
Father are you all right

Li addresses Fox

LI
Wudan should have gotten rid of you
long ago Its been a long time

Jade Fox You dont remember me
But you should remember my master
You infiltrated Wudan while I was
away You stole our master Now
its time for you to pay

FOX
Your master underestimated us women
Sure hed sleep with me but he
would never teach me He deserved
to die by a womans hand

LI
You stole the secrets of Wudans
highest martial arts But after
ten years of training your moves
are still undisciplined And
today under a Wudan sword you
will die

Li easily brings Fox to the ground

Li raises his sword to the prostrate Fox A figure masked
in black appears next to Fox sword extended saving her

her gang

YU

cast suspicion on him It might
get Sir Te in trouble

SIR TE
This is a delicate matter

YU
Sir Te can you find some excuse to
invite Madam Yu and her daughter

SIR TE
What do you have in mind

YU
The best way to trap a fox is
through her cubs

Sir Te and Li look puzzled
EXT SIR TES GARDEN - DAY

Yu sits with Madam Yu and Jen They busy themselves with
various items for her trousseau

MADAM YU
Madam Te is certainly spoiling us
with these wedding gifts Shes
being so considerate
YU
Im sorry shes not feeling well
enough to receive you today

MADAM YU
I heard Sir Te lost something And
now Madame Tes not feeling well

Jen sits silently reading

YU
We know who stole the missing item
If the thief returns it Im sure
Sir Te will pursue the matter no
further

MADAM YU
Thats good Sometimes the help
cant keep their hands to themselves
Its very embarassing

YU
Sir Te knows that even well-meaning
people can make mistakes that

can bring ruin to themselves and
their families

MADAM YU
But dont be too lenient

YU
No mercy will be shown toward the
murderer who turned up in Peking

MADAM YU
A murderer

YU
Yes The very killer of Li Mu
Bais own master Last night she
killed a policeman who had tracked
her down

MADAM YU
A female criminal Now thats news

Jen becomes visibly upset

JEN
You say she killed a policeman
YU
Yes from the West He went
undercover and and followed her
here

MADAM YU
Maybe the murderer and the thief
are one and the same

YU
I doubt it This thief it very
unusual

As Yu speaks she lifts the tea pot to pour Jen some tea
As she finishes speaking she looks into Jens face and the
pot slips from her hand Without even looking down Jen
instinctively catches the pot with a lightning-fast move

YU
-And most likely smarter than a
mere killer

Sir Te and Li Mu Bai walk by

JEN
(formal)
Greetings Sir Te

SIR TE

Bai the renowned swordsman

EXT TE COMPOUND - NIGHT

A still dark night

EXT TES STUDY - NIGHT

Something moves in the moonlight A hooded figure jumps down
Li Mu Bai who had been hiding in the shadows comes forward

LI
Isnt it a bit too late to be out
Youve brought me the sword

FIGURE
I do as I please

The masked figure lunges away but Li Mu Bai leaps with
incredible speed and grabs the sword from her

LI
Wheres your master

FIGURE
Whats it to you

The figure floats away Li chases after her
EXT PEKING STREET - NIGHT

The two fly over houses and bounce off of rooftops
displaying amazing floating skills

INT ABANDONED MONASTERY - NIGHT

The figure bounces into an old monastery Li is already
there

LI
Had enough flying Youve got
potential Youve studied the
Wudan Manual but you dont
understand it You need a real
master

The figure doesnt respond but we sense the pride in her
eyes

FIGURE
Do you think you are a real master

LI
Like most things I am nothing
Its the same for this sword All
of it is simply a state of mind

FIGURE
Stop talking like a monk Just
fight

LI

Then tell me where Jade Fox is

FIGURE
On guard

LI
Real sharpness comes without effort

EXT MONASTERY - NIGHT

The figure leaps into the garden but again Li is ahead of
her

The figure attacks Li who uses his agility to evade her
Frustrated the figure intensifies her attack

The figure losing composure attacks wildly Li gets even
more elusive using a branch to repel her

LI
No growth without assistant No
action without reaction No desire
without restraint Now give
yourself up and find yourself again
There is a lesson for you

Li now holds the stick to her mask gently raising it
slightly

FIGURE
Go ahead

LI
Why should I You need practice
I can teach you to fight with the
Green Destiny but first you must
learn to hold it in stillness

FIGURE
Why do you want to teach me

LI
Ive always wanted a disciple
worthy of Wudans secrets

FIGURE
And if I use them to kill you

LI
Thats a risk Im willing to take
Deep down youre good Even Jade
Fox couldnt corrupt you

The figures eyes cloud with tears
FIGURE
Wudan is a whorehouse Keep your

lessons

alone in the monastery

INT JENS ROOM - NIGHT

Jen slips in through the window She pulls off her mask as
she spots the GovernessFox sitting and sewing

FOX
Youre home late or should I say
early

JEN

Why are you still here You killed
a policeman You should leave
Youll bring ruin on my whole family

FOX

They wouldnt have found me if you
hadnt stolen the sword Like a
little girl you thought stealing
would be fun You too are
responsible for that death Come
with me You dont want to waste
your life as the wife of some
bureaucrat Denied your talent
As a master and disciple we will
rule

JEN
Ill never live as a thief

FOX
Youre already a thief

JEN
That was just for fun How can I
leave Where would I go

FOX
Wherever we want Well get rid of
anyone in our way Even your father

JEN
Shut up

FOX
Its the Giang Hu fighter
lifestyle kill or be killed

Exciting isnt it

JEN
I owe you nothing

FOX
Yes you do You are still my
disciple

Jen lunges at the Governess and the two exchange a few
blows Jen presses her finger against one of the Governesss
pressure points disabling her Jen pushes her across the
room

JEN
You think youve been teaching me
all these years from the manual
You couldnt even decipher the
symbols

FOX
I studied the diagrams But you
hid the details

JEN
You wouldnt have understood even
if I had tried to explain You
know youve gone as far as you
can go I hid my skills so as not
to hurt you

FOX
If I hadnt seen you fight with Li
Mu Bai Id still be ignorant of
all youve hidden from me

JEN
Master I started learning from
you in secret when I was 10 You
enchanted me with the world of
Giang Hu But once I realized I
could surpass you I became so
frightened Everything fell apart
I had no one to guide me no one to
learn from

FOX
Believe me Ive a lesson or two
left to teach you

Fox exits

EXT TES COURTYARD - DAY

Li practices fluently with Green Destiny in hand beautifully
at ease with the weapon He spins around to find Yu standing
in the doorway

YU
The sword is back are you happy

Li smiles

LI
I admit getting it back makes me
realize how much Id missed it

YU
But its not your sword anymore
You gave it to Sir Te

LI
True But I must borrow it for one
last mission Jade Fox must die at
its edge Did you know what you
were hiding when you covered for
that girl
YU
My job was to get the sword back
without embarassing anyone I
wasnt about to ruin her life or
her fathers

LI
You did your job well But this
girl I saw her last night

YU

I knew she would intrigue you

LI
She needs direction and training
YU
Shes an aristocrats daughter
Shes not one of us In any case

it will all be over soon Youll
kill Fox and shell marry

LI
Thats not for her She should
come to Wudan and become a disciple

YU
But Wudan does not accept women

LI
For her they might make an
exception If not Im afraid
shell become a poisoned dragon

YU
Its not our affair Even if Wudan
accepts her her husband might
object

LI
I thought by giving away the sword
I could escape the Giang Hu world
But the cycle of bloodshed continues

YU
I wish there were something more I
could do to help you

LI
Just be patient with me Shu Lien

coming

His warning is useless From Jens pov we see the guards
slaughtered in a hail of arrows and swords

MADAM YU
Lower the shade dont let them see

DARK CLOUD (LO)
Dont touch the women

Though unharmed Madam Yu immediately faints Lo approaches
the carriage and grabs the comb from Jens hand

She bolts from the carriage and once outside bends down
and grabs a lance from the body of a dead guard whose horse
flails beside him

She looks up to see the gang of bandits already making their
escape on horseback

LO
Lets go

EXT DESERT - DAY

EXT DESERT BLUFF - DAY

A group of bandits is dividing up the loot as Jen rides up
keeping a respectable distance They notice her and rise as
she dismounts

One of them saunters over to her and stands grinning a few
feet away

n a second shes slammed his balls into his stomach and
nocked his nose into his face He crumples to the sand

The other bandits stop laughing quickly exchange glances
and charge her at once

n amatter of seconds theyre either on the ground or
dragging their fallen comrades back

Lo calls out and stops the fight

LO
Shes mine

EXT DESERT - DAY

She kicks him They fight ferociously until Lo exhausted
collapses She kicks him a few times then collapses too

INT CAVE - DAY
Jen comes to and finds herself wrapped in a blanket of
animal fur She sits up with a start and checks her clothes
Looking around she realizes shes in a cave Next to her
are a lamp some hunting equipment and a neat row of sharp
arrows She quickly grabs one of the arrows

LO
If you like that arrow I can make
you a bow Great for hunting wild
chicken Theyre delicious

Jen raises one of the arrows going on the attack again but
her legs betray her and she falls

LO
You need to eat understand Then
youll have the strength to fight
Understand

He helps her up then pours her some horse milk from a sac
He hands her a small chunk of food which she first accepts
grudgingly then her hunger getting the better of her she
starts to wolf it down

LO
Youre eating too fast Slowly

roasts over a fire Lo whistles

But soon she passes out

water but she chokes and tries to push him away only to
find that her legs and hands are tied up

LO
Youve got quite a temper Its
better this way
You coward
LO
Still in a bad mood At least

youre speaking Whats your name

Jen spits at Lo

LO
I didnt think the Hans had names
like that
Later She weaves in and out of consciousness In the

flickering lights she sees Lo sharpening his arrows

Later he pulls back an opaque curtain to reveal a makeshift
bathroom -- a water-filled cavity serves as a tub

He rises as Jen sobs at the sight of her imprisoned and
dishevelled body He comes over and unties her

LO
Relax If I had wanted to I would
already have done it You must be
dying for a bath Fresh waters
hard to get here But I managed to
bring some up You can wear my
clothes when youre done Theyre
clean Dont worry Ill sing so
youll know where I am After the
bath youll be calmer

Jen nods and the bandit releases her He starts to sing as
he walks out Jen waits until the sound recedes before
closing the curtain behind her and dipping into the pit
While she bathes she listens to his singing a loud
rendition of a tribal song Lo apparently doesnt remember
all the lyrics and la-las his way through more than a few
passages Jen smiles

INT CAVE - NIGHT

Jen grimaces as Lo pulls the last of some cactus needles
from the soles of her feet

LO
No more hitting on the head All
this trouble for a comb

JEN
Its mine It means a lot to me
A barbarian like you wouldnt
understand

LO
Not true I can use it to pick
fleas from my horse

JEN
By the way Im a real Manchurian

LO
Im sorry I guessed wrong I

though you were a Han

JEN
Give me back my comb

LO
I dont take orders from anyone

JEN
Give it back

Jen impulsively grabs an arrow and stabs Lo drawing a
little blood from his chest Furious Lo lunges at her and
they tussle briefly Finally Lo gets on top of Jen and
the scuffling becomes more like foreplay Violence turns
into unleashed passion

stars alone I thought if I rode
to the other end of the desert Id
find them Ive been riding in the
desert ever since

JEN
And so the little boy became a
fearsome bandit He couldnt find
the stars so he stole my comb
Lo pauses

LO
Out here you always fight for
survival You have to be part of a
gang to stand a chance Slowly
your gang becomes your family All

tired of this life You might
begin to miss your family If it
were our daughter wed look for
her too She would miss us Jen
I want you to be mine forever I
will make my mark on the world I
will earn your parents respect
We have a legend Anyone who dares
to jump from the mountain God will
grant his wish Long ago a young
mans parents were ill so he

wish had come true If you believe

Mu Bai hold on Give me some
hope

LI
Shu Lien

YU

Save your strength

LI
My life is departing Ive only
one breath left

YU
Use it to meditate Free yourself
from this world as you have been
taught Let your soul rise to
eternity with your last breath Do
not waste it for me

LI
Ive already wasted my whole life
I want to tell you with my last
breath I have always loved you
I would rather be a ghost drifting
by your side as a condemned
soul than enter heaven without
you Because of your love I
will never be a lonely spirit

Yu cries
She kisses him lightly He closes his eyes
EXT PATH - DAY

As the sun rises Jen rides speedily clutching the medicine
in her hands

INT ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY

Li is in Yus arms Theyre holding hands The sun shines
in Yu slowly releases Lis stiff fingers -- he is dead
Jen is at the door

Hes gone
Bo peeks over Jens shoulder

Yu rises and picks up Green Destiny Jen kneels Yu raises
the sword but doesnt kill her

YU
Bo please take this sword back
to Sir Te

He takes the sword from her

YU
(to Jen)
Now you must go to Wudan Mountain
Lo awaits you there Promise me
one thing whatever path you take
in this life be true to yourself

EXT WU TAN TEMPLE - DAY

Jen climbs up toward the temple finally reaching the temple
gate and sees Lo standing there

He runs to her She greets him
INT WU TAN TEMPLE - MAGIC

Jen and Lo make love

INT WU TAN TEMPLE - DAY

Lo wakes up to find the jade comb on the pillow beside him
Jen gone

EXT WU TAN MOUNTAIN - DAY

Lo catches up to Jen who stands on a bridge The gorges
below are shrouded in clouds She looks back at him

JEN
Do you remember the legend of the
young man

LO
A faithful heart makes wishes come
true
JEN
Make a wish Lo

Lo pauses

LO
(closing his eyes)
To be back in the desert together
again

Jen smiles turns and leaps into the clouds They seem to
catch her gently before she disappears into them

Lo remains standing a smile on his face tears rolling down
his cheeks

THE END
