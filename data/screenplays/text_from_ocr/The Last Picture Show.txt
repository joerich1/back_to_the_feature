FADE IN
E HER CITY SQUARE - DAI 1
Cold windy morning in Texas Except for one car -- an

old white Nash that belongs to ANDY FANNER the night-
watchman the square is deserted Wind blows the curling
dust down the empty main street past the picture show

a laundry a dinky beauty parlor a grocery store A
black Chevrolet pickup vintage 1941 is coughing its way
up the long road toward the square

S ‘Ss Cc) CITY SQUARE) — WN 2

SONNY CRAWFORD riddles intently with the choke trying to
keep the pickup running The radio is on but the sound
of the motor all but drowhs it out In front of the
picture show the pickup dies and the popular 1951 song
fills the cab Sonny relaxes yawns peers at the movie
posters a moment (He wears a Levi jacket and his hair

is neatly combed - except for a cowlick at the back
which sticks straight up now and then he tries to smooth
it down) Before hitting the starter again he blows into
his hands The pickup grinds for a minute then kicks off
-- Sonny races the engine before moving on At the red
light he looks over at Fanner who is asleep in the front
seat his feet in heavy brogans are visible propped on
the dashboard A pickup with three horses in it goes
through the light Sonny starts to turn toward the pool-
hall but far down the street sees a figure sweeping and
drives that way instead BILLY is sweeping down the
white line toward the city limits sign ribbons of dust
around the broom (He too wears a frayed Levi jacket --
also an old red baseball cap)

Sonny pulls up beside him and taps his horn Billy looks
up grins happily trots around and gets into the cab
Sonny makes a sweeping U-turn reaches over and turns
Billy’s cap around backwards Billy grins The song is
over and an announcer comes on

COTTONSEED CLARK (vo)
Folks ol’ Cottonseed Clark talkin’
at you -- we’Il get some more good
music out to you in a minute but
first let me say a word or two about
these wonderful Purina Poultry
Chows

4 EXT POOLHALI - DAWN

C) Sonny parks in front of the poolhall he and Billy
hurry in -- the dust blowing

5 INT PO

Near the front there’s a counter a small candy case
and a green Dr Pepper machine SAM (the lion) is
bent over the snooker table brushing the felt care-
fully and slowly (He wears an old mackinaw and a
pair of thoroughly run-down sheepskin house shoes )

He winces at the inrush of cold wind but gives the
boys no more than a glance As he bends to brush again
he is seized with a coughing fit and has to stop brush-
ing until the fit subsides going behind the counter
for his cough medicine

During Sam’s seizure Billy picks up a piece of pool-
chalk and ildy begins to lick it Sonny gets himself
a Peanut Pattie and a Dr Pepper puts a nickel on
the counter and goes over to stand right in front of
the old open-burner gas stove to warm himself Sam
starts to roll a cigarette

SAM
(fondly)
Well you’ve already spent a
dime today an’ you ain’t even
had a decent breakfast

q

Sam holds out his hand for the chalk Billy is licking
Billy his tongue quite green hands it to him and
comes to stand next to Sonny who grabs his cap Sam
watches as Billy lunges for it and Sonny feints and
throws it across the room - Billy goes to get it

SAM
(lighting cigarette)
I’m surprised you had the nerve
to come in this mornin’ after
the stompin’ y’all took

SONNY
(munching candy)
Coulda been worse

Sonny idly takes a cue stick as the sound of very loud
MUFFLERS is HEARD Billy looks nervously outside as
Sonny does

C) ABILENE is seen getting out of his souped-up shiny
Mercury wearing sunglasses

SAM
(during the above)
You can say that ’bout nearly
everything

7 INT OL DAWN 7

SAM
(continuing)
A few football teams’ve had some
luck with tackling -- keeps the
other team from scoring quite
so often

SONNY
Sounds too rough for me

Abilene comes in gives them a nod unzips his cover-
alls and hangs them on a nail (His flannel shirt
has pearl buttons and his gabardine pants are well-
pressed) Billy begins to sweep along one side of
the poolhall restlessly

SAM
You don’t even care if it was
your last game -- you ain‘’t ever
gonna get stomped for your own
high school again -- where’s
your school spirit

SONNY
(glancing at
Abilence)
Don’t know --

SAM
(to Sonny)
You workin’ today

SONNY
(nods)
The truck’s bein’ greased

Sam reaches beneath the counter and lays Abilence’s

ivory-banded jointed cue on the counter Abilene

lays his sunglasses on the counter and Sam automatically
C) puts them in a drawer

Abilene looks at Sam as he assembles his cue Sam
looks at him gets the point takes out an old but
well-stuffed wallet and hands Abilene a fifty dollar
bill Both are quite cool when their eyes meet

SAM
(to Sonny)
See -- this here’s what I get
for bettin’ on my hometown ball
team -- oughta have better sense

ABILENE
(putting his
cue together)
Wouldn’t hurt if you had a better
hometown

Billy sweeps to the door scared of Abilene he goes
out as Abilene comes by Sonny who holds the cue awk-
wardly Wishing he’d never picked it up Abilene adds
the fifty dollar bill to a huge wad held together by
a money clip

ABILENE
(continuing)
Mind pointin’ that at the floor
till I get by I don’t want my
eye poked out

Sonny hurriedly points the cue at the floor

SAM
Don’t let Billy get too far away
will ya sor

ABILENE
Youre a damn sight more dangerous
in a poolhall than you are ona
foolball field Ever heard of
tackling

Sonny puts up his cue Abilene breaks a rack of red-
balls moves smoothly around the table Sam starts to
cough again and Sonny goes out

EXT POOL I - DA 8

Billy is three doors away sweeping at the swirling dust
As Sonny catches up with him a pickup stops in the mid-
ddle of the street THREE YOUNG ROUGHNECKS huddle in
the back their coat collars turned up One is DUANE
JACKSON who jumps out quickly holding an old lunch
pail

SONNY
Hey Duane

DUANE
Boy I froze my ass last night

He and Sonny grab Billy each getting an arm As they
hustle him back to the poolhall the DRIVER of the pickup
honks his horn at them and yells out his window

DRIVER
Why the fuck can’t you kids learn
to tackle

At a loss for a reply the boys look at each other hustle
Billy back to the poolhall and turn to go Sam leans out
the door with a green change-sack in his hand yells over

the wind

SAM
How about takin’ Genevieve some
change -- since you’re going
He heaves the sack underhanded -- Duane leaps up and

catches it one-handed trous along fades and throws a
short pass to Sonny who catches it stops stoops and
centers the sack back to Duane They go on down the
street spiritedly throwing the sack back and forth
between them TWO MECHANICS are standing near the cafe
one of them morosely kicking at the tire of his car They
observe the boys without changing their poker-faced
expressions

1ST MECHANIC
Look at that Larry They can
catch

LARRY
(slow drawl)
Feisty sonsofbitches ain’t they
Wisht they could tackle

iST MECHANIC
Or do somethin’ useful Team
weren’t worth a kiss-my-ass this
year

The boys stop and frown but the two men sullenly stare
them down so they go into the cafe which is rundown on
the outside -- much of the paint peeling off the sign
not hanging straight

9 INT CAFE DAY 9

Small clean and cozy with bright linoleum four red
leatherette booths several stools and a shiny juke-
box which is playing TWO COWBOYS are sitting at the
counter a DRILLER with a toothpick in his mouth is at
the cash register and some ROUGHNECKS occupy two of
the booths Duane tosses the sack one final time but
in catching it Sonny almost runs into GENEVIEVE carry-
ing several plates of sausage and eggs in her hands
Stepping back the swinging door to the kitchen hits her
on the behind she fixes them with a fond but stern eye

GENEVIEVE
All right you boys knock it off
-- I got problems enough without
you playing the game over again

A cowboy looks around at them with disgust
Sonny smiles at her and puts the sack on the counter

SONNY
We coulda run off to Mexico with
this you know

The boys laugh and stand in front of the jukebox as
Genevieve waits on tables Sonny tosses a quarter up
and catches it studying the selections When he tos-
ses it up again Genevieve catches it

GENEVIEVE
(going into kitchen)
Down-payment on breakfast Let
somebody prosperous play the
jukebox

DUANE
(grinning)
Nobody prosperous would eat here

Sonny laughs and so does Duane They take a booth
and empty their pockets pooling their money -- very
little

SONNY
Well I ain’t so hungry

DUANE

(a little anxiously)
Say y’ want the pickup first
tonight

A lanky COWBOY stops by their table on the way out
looks down at them a toothpick in his mouth The
boys don’t notice him

SONNY
Sure I’m sure Anyways I got
lots of deliveries -- have to

go clear to Ranger this afternoon

DUANE
Okay

SONNY

(noticing the

cowboy )
Be lucky to get back in time for
the second show

Duane follows Sonny’s look to the cowboy whose expres-
sion is somber almost grave After another silent
moment he shakes his head says Tsk returns the
toothpick to his mouth and walks on out never once
changing his expression The boys look at each other
hopelessly

just in front of them nodding as they do

JACY

Hi what you all doing back here

Sonny looks at her wistfully with yearning Charlene
frowns and begins to pop her finger joints sitting up
very prim and proper as jacy and Duane begin to kiss
passionately

sound so good to me Sounded like
he wanted to be a nightingale

MR CECIL
No not really -- he --

JOE BOB
I think it’s silly of all these
poets to want to be somethin’
besides what the Lord made ‘em
It’s criticizing the Lord

MR CECIL
I dont think he wanted to be a
nightingale Joe Bob Maybe he
just wanted to be immortal

All you have to do to be immortal
is lead a good Christian life
Anybody can do it if they love the

On the dresser is a big picture of herself as Football

of herself and Duane plus a few mementoes (menu from the
Junior Prom) Stuffed animals on the bedside table Lois
knocks comes in and leans against the door Jacy picks
up a jar of blemish cream and goes to the dresser where
she cleanses her face Her RADIO is playing

LOIS
I guess you hate me tonight

JACY
(opening jar)
Oh Momma you know I love you
But I love Duane too even if
you don’t like it

LOIS
I don’t care I’d just hate to
see you marry him You wouldn’t
be rich any moré and in about
two months --

JACY
I don’t care about money --

Rev 92470

LOIS
(continuing)
he’d quit flattering you --

JACY
Not at all -

LOIS
You’re pretty stupid then

JACY
(shocked)
You married Daddy when he was
poor -- and he got rich didn’t
he

LOIs
(looking at china
animals on bureau)
I scared your Daddy into getting
rich beautiful

JACY
(pouting)
Well if Daddy could do it Duane
could too

LOIS
Not married to you - you’te
not scary enough

JACY
Well you’re rich and you’re
miserable -- I sure don’t want
to be like you

LOIS
Not much danger of that
(looks at Duane’s
photo)
Have you slept with him

JACY
Momma

LoIs
(amused)
Well we can go to the doctor
sometime and we’1l arrange
something so you won’t have to
worry about babies -- You do
have to be careful about that

JACY
(beyond belief)
But Momma it’s a sin isn’t it
Unless you’re married You know
I wouldn’t do that

LOIS
(loudly)
Oh don’t be so mealy-mouthed--
I thought if you slept with Duane
a few times you’d see there

isn’t anything magic about him
and then we can send you to a
good school --

JACY
(plaintively)
But I don’t wanna leave --
LOIS
-- where you’ll marry some
wealthy kid --

JACY

Why can’t I just stay here and
go to college in Wichita Falls

LoIs
(very straight)
Because everything’s flat and
empty here -- and there’s nothing
to do
(picks up per-
fume bottle)

May I have some of this --
JACY
(grudgingly)
Help yourself -- don’t you have
any
LOIs

Yes but I feel like smelling
good right now -- don’t you
ever feel like doing anything
right now

Lois touches herself behind the ears puts her hands
on her throat for a moment savoring the scent closes
her eyes The cream is off Jacy’s face and she looks
very young Lois softens

Rev 10670 30

LOIS
You should leave your face just
like that -- all you really need
now is an eyebrow pencil

dJacy looks blank and sleepy Lois touches her hair
LOIs

thing to do -- good way to get
drowned She bet me a silver
dollar she could beat me - and
she did -- my horse never wanted
to take the water She was always

that -- something wild She’s
still got the silver dollar

CHESTER
He’s a good ol’ boy ain’t he

Everything grows quiet players take off helmets 163
Coach takes off his cap a hushed moment -- then

the band begins the school song and whole school

begins to SING

ALL
Anarene High School we love you
Love you oh so grand
We will always be so loyal
Loyal to a man

Whether in defeat or victory
We will always be true

Dear old Anarene we love you
And we’ll fight for you

The song sweeps over the quiet field the still town
Sonny moves his lips but doesn’t really sing Caught
by a strong emotion he loooks around the stands at
the players the band The song comes to an end

What am I doing apologizing to
you Why am I always apologizing
to you you little bastard Three
months I been apologizing to you
without you even being here I
haven’t done anything wrong --
why can’t I quit apologizing
You’re the one ought to be sorry
I wouldn’t be in my bathrobe if it
hadn’ta been for you -- I’da had
my clothes on hours ago You’re
the one made me quit caring if I
got dressed or not I guess just
becuase your friend got killed
you want me to forget what you
did an’ make it all right I’m
not sorry for you You’d’ve left
Billy too just like you left me

I bet you left him plenty a nights

whenever that girl whistled I
wouldn’t treat a dog that way

Sonny begins to say something

RUTH

(continuing)
I guess you thought I was so old
and ugly you didn’t owe tne any
explanations Didn’t need to be
careful of me

There wasn’t anything I could do
about you and her -- why should
you be careful of me You didn’t
love me Look at me

Can’t you even look at me

Sonny looks finally but doesn’t know what to say

here I’m around that corner now
You’ve ruined it and it’s lost
completely Just your needing me
won’t make it come back

Ruth’s hands are nervously clasped on the table

stiff but Sonny holds on and in a moment disconcerted
she lets him hold it His fingers weave through hers

With the fingers of her other hand she begins to smooth
the hair at the back of his wrist then turns his hand
over traces the lives in his palm up to the wrist presses
the tips of her fingers against the blue viens at his
wrist and goes upward under the sleeve of his shirt All
at once tears spring in her eyes She takes Sonny’s hand
and presses it to her throat to her wet face She is on
the verge of saying something fine something wise or
brave or beautiful gasps with it squeezes his hand
loses the words After a moment quieter she puts his
hand on the table strokes his fingers with hers She
notices his shirt collar is wrinkled under his jacket
and tenderly reaches to straighten it
