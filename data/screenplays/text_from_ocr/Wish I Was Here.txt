FIRST DRAFT
IN BLACK

The SOUND OF A MAN PANTING FOOTSTEPS racing TWIGS
SNAPPING underfoot His breath is heavy to feed his pace

INT FOREST - MORNING 1

TIGHT on AIDAN BLOOM as he sprints through the ethereal
morning fog of a BEAUTIFUL FOREST He wears a FUTURISTIC
SPACE SUIT and HELMET and clutches a WARRIOR’S BROAD SWORD in
his fist He squints his eyes as he looks back at SOMETHING
unseen and ominous that’s CHASING HIM

Aidan hears a NOISE He looks up to see A SMALL FLYING
ROBOTIC UNIT hovering alongside him It beeps like R2D2 as if
to say “It’s gaining on us”

AIDAN’s FRANTIC FACE he’s sprinting with every ounce of
energy he has when

LITTLE BOY (0S)
Dad what’s your password

ON AIDAN Where the fuck did that come from TUCKER BLOOM shirtless and carrying an electric drill and an ipad steps
out from behind a GIANT REDWOOD

TUCKER
Dad What’s your password

Aidan stops abruptly and stares at his son confused

INT BLOOM HOUSE KITCHEN TABLE - MORNING 2

ON AIDAN’S FACE the CAMERA PULLS BACK QUICKLY to reveal
Aidan at the head of his family’s chaotic morning breakfast
routine The TV plays EARSPLITTING CARTOONS Aidan’s wife
SARAH BLOOM chops carrots for lunches in the background

TUCKER

AIDAN
I have no fucking idea

TUCKER
Swear jar

AIDAN

TUCKER
(singing)
You gotta fuck the swear jar

SARAH
Tucker Stop The password is
1234
(to Aidan)
What are you doing

AIDAN
The swear jar is full Look at it

We see an OVERFLOWING SWEAR JAR on top of the refrigerator

AIDAN (CONTD)
The swear jar is all the money we
have to send you kids to college so
you should be happy that I curse so
that you and your sister can one
day blow off class and pull bong
hits in your dorm room

TUCKER
What’s a bong

AIDAN
It’s a type of vase

TUCKER
What’s a vase

AIDAN
A bong for flowers

GRACE enters She is dressed in all black with long
sleeves and a skirt that goes down to her ankles

GRACE
I heard you dad Rabbi Perlman
says cursing is for the weak
minded

AIDAN
Yeah well Rabbi Perlman’s breath
makes God question why he even
bothered creating the universe
GRACE
If you can curse we all can curse

AIDAN
Fine

GRACE
Hairy balls

SARAH
Gracie

AIDAN

Wow I did not see that coming Way
to dive in

Tucker holds up the ipad to show a GORGEOUS FERRARI

Yes

TUCKER
Dad we need this car

AIDAN
We’re not getting a Ferrari but
right now you can curse

TUCKER
Fuck and tits

AIDAN
Went for kind of a combo there I
like it

TUCKER
This Ferrari is the coolest car in
the whole universe

AIDAN
It amazes me how clueless you
people seem to be about our
financial situation Do you want me
to sell the minivan

TUCKER GRACE
Yes

AIDAN (CONTD)
Well I’m not going to It has more
beverage caddies than any other
embarrassing car in its class

TUCKER
That’s fucking bullshit
SARAH
How is this helpful

AIDAN
Who cares if they curse It’s so
stupid I never understood what the
big deal is

SARAH
There is a societal agreement that
children don’t curse

AIDAN

Well I disagree with society’s
agreement And right now at this
particular moment I don’t give a
flying fuck if anyone in this house
curses

TUCKER GRACE
Fuck everybody Anuses

Sarah can’t help but laugh She’s too exhausted to care

SARAH
Shit Clock School

EXT BLOOM HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 3

Aidan bursts through the front door in a nice suit Grace and
Tucker are dressed in conservative private school uniforms
Sarah comes rushing out of the house

SARAH
Tucker Yalmulka Tzitzit

Sarah brings a Jewish “skullcap” and tzitzit (a knotted
fringe worn by religious Jewish men and boys) to the open
mini-van door

AIDAN
What is wrong with you man

TUCKER
I was thinking about that Ferrari

AIDAN
Forget about the Ferrari It’s time
for you to start thinking about the
plight of the Jews

TUCKER
What does plight mean
AIDAN
Ask the Rabbis that’s what we’re
paying them for

SARAH
You have to talk to your father
today Aidan He still hasn’t paid
this semesters tuition

AIDAN
Uchh I hate talking to him about
money When was it due

SARAH
A month ago They’re threatening to
kick them out if they don’t get a
check by the end of the week

AIDAN
Ok I’1l1 talk to him today

Aidan backs the car out of the driveway

SARAH
(calling out)
Avoid the rabbis if you see them

AIDAN
(with a smile)
I always do

They pull away

INT MINIVAN - MOMENTS LATER

An AMAZING SONG plays on the car stereo as Tucker struggles
to redress his tzitzit under his shirt in the moving car

AIDAN
You need help gearing up back
there Yentl

TUCKER
Don’t call me Yentl

GRACE
You can call me Yentl I love that
movie

AIDAN
Unfortunately we know
GRACE
(singing)
Papa can you hear me

AIDAN
Please don’t do that

She reaches for the stereo

AIDAN (CONTD)
If you change this song I will eat
your fingers off

GRACE
The boys get to do all the cool
things to honor Hashem I won’t get
to do anything remotely cool until
I buy my sheitel

AIDAN
Sheitel What’s that again

GRACE
It’s a modesty wig When I get
married I’1l shave my head and wear
a wig for the rest of my life That
way only my husband will find me
pretty

AIDAN
No offense but that’s the weirdest
tradition I’ve ever heard And it
wouldn’t even work on you You’re
so pretty you’d look even prettier
with a shaved head It’ll defeat
the whole purpose

Grace can’t help but smile at that Aidan sees something

AIDAN (CONTD)
You’ve got to be fucking kidding
me

GRACE
What

He pulls the car over A LARGE CONCRETE RETAINING WALL near
their home has been covered with GRAFFITI It appears to be a
1950S ERA ROBOT

TUCKER
Who did that
AIDAN
A douchebag that’s who And you
know what That’s gonna be there
for years The city’s bankrupt
they’re never gonna get around to
covering that up

GRACE
Dad we’re gonna be late for
morning prayers

Aidan shakes his head and floors the minivan down the street

INT MINIVAN EXT YESHIVA - MOMENTS LATER 5

The minivan door flies open in front of a Yeshiva (a very
religious Jewish private school) Conservative looking
parents and their children intermingle with RABBIS in full
regalia (black suits hats long curled sideburns)

AIDAN
Wait Tucker come back here

Aidan leans into the back seat to tuck in Tucker’s shirt and
make sure his tzitzit are hanging correctly

AIDAN (CONTD)

We don’t want you to get in trouble
like last time And stop chewing on
those knots like you’re a
Rottweiler these things are
expensive

(then)
The drill

Tucker pulls the electric drill from his backpack

AIDAN (CONTD)
Good Now go be Jewish

TUCKER
Why

AIDAN
I’m not sure ask the Rabbis

The second the door closes Aidan digs into his ash tray to
pull out a half-smoked joint He lights it as he pulls away

KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK Aidan whips his head to reveal RABBI
ROSENBERG in full Orthodox regalia with the addition of a
NEON ORANGE CROSSING GUARD VEST knocking on his window

Aidan quickly stabs out the roach and rolls down the window

RABBI ROSENBERG
Shalom Mr Bloom

AIDAN
Shalom Rabbi Rosenberg

RABBI ROSENBERG
Mr Bloom Rabbi Twersky would like
to see you in his office if you
have a moment

AIDAN
Oh you know today I really can’t
Today believe it or not a moment
is not something I have Even for a
man as mighty and all-knowing as
Rabbi Twersky I’m gonna have to
take a rain-check

RABBI ROSENBERG
Speaking of rain as you know every
year to celebrate the holiday of Tu
Bishvat we ask the children to
donate money to have a tree planted
in Israel

AIDAN
Yeah I heard about that But when
you think about it how many trees
do they really need over there
Rabbi Besides I gave like a
forest at my Bar Mitzvah Right now
I need to focus on my own little
holy-land over in Reseda You know
times being what they are

RABBI ROSENBERG
Which is why Mr Bloom we
encourage the children to plant a
seedling in their own backyard

Rabbi Rosenberg leans down and pulls a completely DEAD
EVERGREEN SEEDLING out of a cardboard box

RABBI ROSENBERG (CONT’D)
You never picked up your seedling
Mr Bloom

He hands it through the car window
AIDAN
Wow thank you I’m gonna go do
some CPR on this thing the second I
have absolutely nothing to do

RABBI ROSENBERG
Just try not to smoke it

He gives Aidan a wry smile

AIDAN
Funny Clever Have any of the
other rabbis told you that you look
very sexy in neon

RABBI ROSENBERG
Talk to Rabbi Twersky about the
tuition don’t make it
uncomfortable for the children
(beat)
Times being what they are

AIDAN
Right

RABBI ROSENBERG
(big smile)
Baruch Hashem

AIDAN
Yeah bless God bless everybody

On Aidan’s face as he pulls away

INT MINIVAN - MOMENTS LATER 6

Aidan pulls the minivan over to the side of the road He
stares at something off-screen He shakes his head

AIDAN
(to himself)
There were three gunshots There
were three gunshots One Two
Three

He speeds off The camera pans 180 degrees to REVEAL he was
staring at the GRAFFITI COVERED RETAINING WALL

INT HARDWARE STORE - DAY 7

Aidan still in his suit fills a shopping cart with painting
supplies a paint roller on a long pole paint cans etc

AIDAN
(to himself)
Weve heard that from you time and
time again over the many weeks that
weve been assembled here

A CONTRACTOR passes and stares at Aidan talking to himself

EXT CONCRETE RETAINING WALL - LATER 8

INSERT THE ROBOT’S FACE on the wall as a paint roller rolls
over his body erasing him forever into the grey nothingness
of municipal infrastructure

WE POP BACK TO REVEAL Aidan stripped down to an undershirt
but with his suit pants still on painting over the graffiti

AIDAN
And now you have the audacity to
insult everyone in this room by
saying they might not have been
gunshots

Aidan takes a step back to admire his work He turns to his
REFLECTION in the minivan window

AIDAN (CONTD)
(to himself in reflection)
What were they then Mr Ortega

He raises his fingers in the shape of a gun at his reflection
and pulls his pointer finger trigger

AIDAN (CONTD)
BANG
INT CASTING AGENCY WAITING ROOM - LATER 9

A WIDE SHOT reveals Aidan sitting amongst a room full of
AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN dressed in sharp suits

CLOSE UP on one of the ACTORS
AFRICAN AMERICAN ACTOR
(to himself)
BANG
CLOSE UP on a SECOND ACTOR holding his finger gun sideways

AFRICAN AMERICAN ACTOR 2
BANG

10 INT AUDITION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 10

CLOSE ON AIDAN Through this speech WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL
the SIX PRODUCERS behind a desk watching him

AIDAN

(He does this well )
Three bangs you said Bang bang
bang This entire case is dependant
on your testimony that on the night
of January 7th outside your food
truck you heard three shots Well
now Mr Ortega you only have one
shot One shot to tell us who has
threatened you with a retribution
so terrifying that youd be willing
to change your entire testimony and
let an assassin free to hunt down
more little boys like Anthony
Jackson You’ve got a cross around
your neck I ask you sir How
many “bangs” did Jesus hear

REVEAL the bewildered expressions on the faces of the
Producers A few whisper to each other

WE SEE A CLOSE-UP of Aidan’s nervous vulnerability through
the MONITOR of the CAMCORDER FILMING his audition

CASTING DIRECTOR
Aidan that was very good as
always But we asked you to come in
for the other role Mr Ortega

AIDAN
Yeah I know And thank you for
calling me in but that role only
has one line And plus Ortega is
Hispanic I mean don’t get me
wrong I could tan and really go
for it but I really feel like I
got a solid handle on this
prosecutor

CASTING DIRECTOR
Aidan weve already decided to go
Black with that role You probably
noticed that you were the only
white person in the waiting room
And truthfully we’re only seeing
those men out of courtesy We just
offered the role to Taye Diggs and
he’s accepted

AIDAN
Oh Wow I feel really stupid now
I’m just trying to be as proactive
as possible

CASTING DIRECTOR
I understand We’d still love you
to read Mr Ortega’s line

AIDAN
Oh yeah sure I mean I get
it If you’re going Black you’re

going Black I can get Ortega tan

but certainly not Taye Diggs tan
Unless I had those pills C Thomas

Howell ate in the movie “Soul Man”
Did you ever see that movie

They stare at him One PRODUCER puts his head in his hand

AIDAN (CONTD)
Well don’t It’s totally racist Or
maybe it isn’t I don’t know Maybe
I only think it’s racist cause I’m
white and I feel guilty laughing
Ask Taye on set I’m sure Taye’s
seen it

CASTING DIRECTOR
Were ready when you are Aidan

Aidan takes a deep breath Shakes the stress out of his body

AIDAN
(Bad Hispanic accent)
For the last time I no longer
think that what I heard were
gunshots Probably just a car
backfiring

CASTING DIRECTOR
Thank you Aidan

Aidan whips around in shock to reveal his father SAUL BLOOM he is eating peanuts out of a jar

AIDAN

head with it

Aidan scrambles to stop the VIDEO Saul seems unfazed

SAUL
You know Genesis tells us to never
spill our seed

AIDAN
Why would Phil Collins care if I
masturbate

SAUL
The book of the Bible not the
music group

AIDAN
I’m equally uninterested in what
either has to say

SAUL
Trouble in the bedroom Aidan Men
have man-needs Those man-needs
need to be met or you end up taking
things into your own hands

AIDAN
Dad why haven’t you paid the
yeshiva tuition I’ve got aggro
rabbis stalking me in crosswalks
It’s like an Orthodox Zombie movie

SAUL
We need to talk But can you please
clean yourself up I can’t talk to
you with your pants at your ankles
I’1l meet you outside

AIDAN
Fine

Saul starts to leave then turns back

SAUL
You’re not going to return to
masturbating are you

AIDAN
No Dad get out

SAUL
Ok Cause I have to be at the
hospital at five and I don’t wanna
get stuck in traffic on the 101

AIDAN

He does Aidan shakes his head incredulous Then turns back
to the monitor thinks about it for a beat then hits play
and continues masturbating

GIRL IN PORNO (0S)

EXT BLOOM HOUSE - DECK - LATER 13

Aidan dries his hands with a dish towel as he crosses to find
his father standing at the precipice of a HALF-FINISHED DECK
The frame has been laid for something much larger but the
boards have only been installed on half of it A GOLDEN
RETRIEVER (KUGEL) takes a giant shit in the corner of the
deck

SAUL
Kugel no
(to Aidan)
Sorry I know you can’t stand the
dog he’s usually so well trained

AIDAN
If you trained that dog to shit
everywhere but the lawn then
youve done an incredible job

SAUL
Deck looks good

AIDAN
Was that sarcasm or serious I
couldn’t tell

SAUL
I guess it was half-sarcastic for
the half that isn’t finished
(then)
And you better have that fence
fixed before it falls on one of the
kids

AIDAN
Well as I’m sure you know quite
well by now Dad we don’t have any
money Sarah’s working her ass off
I’m auditioning every chance I get
but I haven’t gotten a decent check
since that dandruff commercial

SAUL
And ironically you still have
dandruff

AIDAN

What is going on with the kids’
tuition We had a deal you said
youd cover it if you got to pick
the school You got your wish

for Hashem when there’s nowhere
else to turn

AIDAN
Once again I’m an agnostic not an
atheist I’1ll believe it when I see
it

SAUL
Well you may just have a chance
I’ve decided to try an experimental
drug trial They’re trying this new
protocol that’s shown some very
promising results but I’m gonna
have to pay out of pocket

AIDAN
So

SAUL
So I can’t afford the school
anymore Aidan I’m down to my last
savings and I’ve decided to spend
it on this So you win

AIDAN
My father has cancer my kids have
to drop out of school and I don’t
have a job How am I winning

SAUL
God works in mysterious ways

AIDAN
This one’s particularly mysterious

SAUL

awhile I’m gonna need you to watch
Kugel

Aidan has to sit down to catch his breath

AIDAN
Okay slow down This is a lot of
horrible news at once

I wished you’d called ahead We’ve

switched to a four day school week

MRS LUIS (CONTD)
Cause of budget cuts we rent the
school out on Fridays to film
shoots

SARAH
Oh my God really

MRS LUIS
Yeah Unfortunately a lot of
schools are going the four day way
After music arts gym and air
conditioning what else are we
gonna cut Math

SARAH
Mrs Luis we can no longer afford
to send our kids to the religious
private school they’ve been
attending And as I’m sure you can
imagine we have some concerns about
them adjusting to the public school
way of doing things

MRS LUIS

Well I’m not gonna lie to you this
is a really tough time for Los
Angeles public schools The state’s
virtually bankrupt The
government’s blaming the unions
the unions blame the government and
in the meantime we’re pooling our
own money for colored pencils

(To Grace)
Sweetheart how many kids are in
your math class

GRACE
Twelve Twelve in almost all my
classes except music In music
there’s only 7 of us

MRS LUIS

I just want you to manage your
expectations We’re not one of the
magnet schools here at Jefferson
Grace’s math class would have about
37 children in it And as I
mentioned music has gone the way
of SAT test prep dead as air-
conditioning

Sarah looks to Aidan

This kitten will not allow his
brother to sleep No matter what I
could watch it over and over again
It’s the hardest I’ve laughed since
the movie about the Greek Wedding

RABBI ROSENBERG
(in Hebrew)
Fat Greek Wedding

RABBI TWERSKY
Fat Girl With A Greek Wedding

AIDAN
I’1l have to look that one up

RABBI TWERSKY
Mr Bloom how can I help you
today

AIDAN
Well Rabbi as you probably know
my father has been paying our
tuition here at Hillel Recently he
has taken ill and it looks like
he’s not going to be able to cover
us anymore

RABBI TWERSKY
I am deeply sorry to hear that
Your father is a lovely man Please
give him our best

AIDAN
Thank you I will

RABBI TWERSKY
So you’re withdrawing the children
from the school

AIDAN
Well no I’d rather not

RABBI TWERSKY
Well they can’t go to school for
free

The two Rabbis share a hearty laugh

AIDAN
Wed pay you back It would just be
for a year or so while we you
know while my wife and I weather-
out this wintery economic climate

Rabbi Rosenberg says something to Twersky in Hebrew

RABBI TWERSKY
Oh yes you’re the actor

AIDAN
Yes

RABBI TWERSKY
And your wife provides for the
family while you act

AIDAN
Yes

RABBI TWERSKY
Well as both a Synagogue and
Yeshiva we exist for the
community Mr Bloom However in
order to do that we must also
remain a business I’m sure you
understand this

AIDAN
All I’m asking for is a little

Aidan looks down at a WORD written in his palm in Sharpie

AIDAN (CONTD)
Tzedakah

Twersky and Rosenberg confer briefly in HEBREW

RABBI TWERSKY
Mr Bloom if you want to buy a
gallon of milk when you only have
enough money for a glass of milk
you must first take that money from
somewhere else So maybe you
decided that this week you will
give up honey You will go “honey-
less” in order to afford a larger
portion of milk

AIDAN
I don’t even like honey but go on

RABBI TWERSKY

If I give you charity I must take
away funds from somewhere else in
our limited budget to provide your
two children with a free education
So how do I do that Help me Who
in this yeshiva should go without
honey so that the Blooms can have a
gallon of free milk

AIDAN
All right look Rabbi I’m not a
religious man

RABBI TWERSKY
You don’t say Give me a moment to
catch my breath

AIDAN
But I just don’t understand how you
can justify not helping out a
family in need in your Jewish
community I mean wouldn’t the
God that you believe in say that
you should help us

RABBI TWERSKY
God works in mysterious ways

AIDAN
Yeah I keep hearing that I feel
like that’s what religious people
say when they can’t figure out what
their God is up to

RABBI TWERSKY
Perhaps God is telling you to stop
acting and to get a real job so you
can properly provide for your
family

AIDAN
But what about my dream Doesn’t
God believe in my “pursuit of
happiness”

RABBI TWERSKY
No that’s the Declaration of
Independence Thomas Jefferson
cared about your happiness God
wants you to provide for your
family Mr Bloom God believes
your family deserves both milk and
honey

Both Rabbis stare down at Aidan He races out of the office

INT PRAYER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 21

Aidan BURSTS into a room full of bobbing and bouncing
children reciting Hebrew prayers (divided into BOYS and GIRL
sections by a partition) Several Rabbis turn to look

AIDAN
Oh so sorry to interrupt Shalom
everybody

The praying STOPS COLD as all eyes turn to Aidan

AIDAN (CONTD)
Hi I’m Grace and Tucker’s dad
Grace I need you to come with me
please

On GRACE mortified as she closes her prayer book and follows
Aidan to the other side of the partition to find Tucker
chewing his tzit-tzits

AIDAN (CONTD)
Tucker Wake-up Gotta go bud

RABBI

AIDAN

that’s impossible to climb ON Aidan’s face in terror

WIDEN TO REVEAL a SHADOWY CLOAKED FIGURE is gaining on them
about 50 yards down the beach He limps like a MAN IN PAIN

Suddenly JAX robotically unfolds two handles from either

The room has been cleaned up Grace sits with perfect posture
awaiting her father’s lesson Aidan wears the corduroy jacket
with elbow patches he mentioned earlier and has taped pieces
of white paper over the plasma TV to act as a makeshift
blackboard Tucker is shirtless and sits upside down on his
head with a pixie-stick dangling from his lips

AIDAN
Okay We’1ll start with attendance

Tucker
TUCKER

Cock and balls

gonna focus on what you’re doing in
school So Grace what are you
working on in math these days

GRACE
Geometry

AIDAN
Great Great I’m gonna let you in
on a little secret you’re never
gonna need that in real life

GRACE
Then why do I have to learn it

AIDAN
I have no idea In case you wanna
be a math teacher or something
Also there’s no “R” in the word
colonel but I’m getting ahead of
myself

GRACE
What about for the SAT’s

AIDAN
Yeah geometry’s probably on there
good thinking So far my grade for
you is A Now let’s dive in
He draws a triangle

AIDAN (CONTD)
Ok what is this

TUCKER
AIDAN
Okay good No extra points for

yelling but correct

TUCKER
AIDAN
No not recess yet Can you please
sit on your ass and not your head

TUCKER
An ass is a donkey

AIDAN
Yes Currently I’m giving you an A
in biology

TUCKER
An ass has an ass

AIDAN
These are facts

GRACE
Dad I’m in 6th grade Were
working on things like
supplementary and complementary
angles determining the areas of
three dimensional shapes
circumferences

AIDAN
Of course I’m getting there
This one was for him

TUCKER
Dad I have to take a choom

AIDAN
What’s a choom

TUCKER
It’s how we say shit in school

AIDAN
Swear jar

TUCKER
I don’t have any money

AIDAN
See that’s where the whole swear
jar thing falls apart for me

GRACE
It’s Hebrew for brown

AIDAN
Oh Got it See we’re all
learning You are free to leave the
classroom for your brown Enjoy

Tucker runs out of the room

AIDAN (CONTD)
Ok Grace Is this triangle
complimentary or supplementary

GRACE
A triangle can’t be complimentary
or supplementary Only the angles
that comprise it can be judged that
way

Grace stands and takes the sharpie out of Aidan’s hand and
begins making perfect notations on the triangle on the
“plasma blackboard” as she speaks Aidan slowly sits down
where she was sitting

GRACE (CONTD)
The triangle you drew albeit
poorly is isosceles meaning at
least two of it’s sides are equal
in length

AIDAN
(totally lost)
Okay wait so then what’s the whole
complimentary thing They’re just
lines why are they so impressed
with one another

GRACE
Two angles are complimentary if
they add up to 90 degrees For
example what angle is
complimentary to a 45 degree angle

AIDAN
(now the student)
A 45 degree angle

GRACE
Good Now a supplementary angle

We begin to notice that SOLDIERS have appeared behind the
white pieces of paper on the plasma and are now shooting guns
at the isosceles triangle

GRACE (CONT’D)
Tucker
Reveal Tucker has the XBOX REMOTE and is attacking the
triangle with his “Call of Duty” troops

TUCKER
I lied about having to choom Dad
I just wanted to kill the triangle

AIDAN
Turn that off we’re in the middle
of a lesson

TUCKER
I was pretending the triangle was
Arab

AIDAN

Oh my God Who told you that Not
all Arabs are bad

TUCKER
Levi Goldfarb said all Arabs want
to kill Jews

AIDAN
No they don’t
TUCKER
Well how do we know which one’s are
bad
AIDAN
(flustered)
Well for starters there’s Al
Qaeda

could almost feel it your
elation

face

watching or that you were dodging

Why

She looks off at the roller coasters on the pier
SARAH

I want to support you I really do
believe in you
AIDAN
(pushing her)
Sarah why did seeing me love
Shakespeare make you sad

SARAH
(a confession)
Cause I was terrified Id never
find that kind of passion for
something And the truth is I
havent

A tear wells in her eye

SARAH (CONTD)
Aidan I know you like to think
were both out there pursuing our
dreams but we’re not When I got
this assignment I thought I’d be
working for the mayor not the
water department I input data into
spreadsheets literally a robot
should be doing my job there’s
just too much bureaucracy for
anyone to notice

AIDAN
You gotta give it some time pretty
soon youll be running that joint

SARAH
I don’t wanna run the fucking water
department

AIDAN
Then what do you what do you want
to do

SARAH
I don’t know But right now I’m on
a fucking a treadmill and if it
stops our kids don’t eat And
that’s all on me

AIDAN
But you just said you supported my
dream

SARAH
When did this relationship become
solely about supporting your dream

AIDAN
So you’re not happy

SARAH
All I’m saying is I don’t think
I can do this forever Something
has to change

AIDAN
(taken aback)
Is that a threat

SARAH
No it’s a confession

Aidan looks like he got punched in the stomach They stare at
each other WE HEAR the SCREAMS of KIDS on the ROLLER-
COASTER

His CELL PHONE RINGS He answers
AIDAN
Hello

(to Sarah)
It’s Dad

INT HOSPITAL - LATER 42

Aidan and Sarah walk hurriedly down Hallway Aidan spot’s
Saul’s internist DR BECKER coming out of a room

AIDAN
Dr Becker What happened

DR BECKER
His body totally rejected the
treatment

AIDAN
It didn’t work

DR BECKER
It didn’t really even have a chance
to work

SARAH
So he’1ll be right back where he
started

DR BECKER

Not exactly The treatment seems to
have taken an unfortunate toll in
your father’s case It’s only
served to weaken his immune system

SARAH
Can we see him

DR BECKER
He’s sleeping but he’s just up
here in ICU

Aidan and Sarah follow Dr Becker into

43 INT HOSPITAL ICU - CONTINUOUS 43

The doctor points to a bed with a grey gaunt man hooked up
to all manners of life sustaining apparatus Aidan almost
doesn’t recognize his father When he does

Aidan swallows hard his eyes well Sarah takes his arm

AIDAN
He’s dying

DR BECKER
I’m not gonna sugarcoat it Aidan
This treatment was a bit of a hail-
Mary pass It’s not looking good
We have to monitor him and see if

to his own room tomorrow

44 INT BLOOM HOUSE - LATER 44

sick and tired of Tucker teasing me
about Jesse Now everyone will know
who I am

(to Aidan)

Why are you looking at me like
that You said I’d still be pretty
even if I shaved my head

SARAH AIDAN
No Completely out of
context

JONAH
I was innocently playing video
games with the boy one Yes he was
teasing her but I thought that was
their normal banter I was not
expecting this

SARAH
Aidan you need to say something I
can’t form words I want to cry but
it’s just hair I shouldnt cry

AIDAN
Grace go to your room Jonah get
the fuck out

JONAH

your care I’ll be keeping the
Death Star

JONAH
That’s bullshit man

AIDAN
Dad’s in the hospital So whatever
shit you have going on with him I
think you need to clear it up fast

JONAH
How long does he have

AIDAN
They don’t know but the fact that
you have to ask that means you’re
planning on procrastinating This
is real Jonah It’s not a joke
You need to wake up life is
happening

Aidan slams the front door in his face

INT HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NEXT DAY 45

Aidan is about to open the door to his father’s room when
Rabbi Rosenberg approaches

RABBI ROSENBERG
Nice to see you Mr Bloom Sorry
it’s under such dire circumstances
The Rabbi is in with him now

AIDAN
Oh good cause praying cancer away
always seems to work

RABBI ROSENBERG
(ignoring him)
I have something for you

Rosenberg hands Aidan a PRE-ARRANGEMENT PACKET

RABBI ROSENBERG (CONT’D)
I’m sorry to throw all of this at
you now But it does have to be
dealt with sooner rather than
later

He reads the cover So Youre Dying On the cover a
smiling grey haired couple ride bikes off into the sunset

The door opens and Rabbi Twerskey shuffles out He says
something in Hebrew to Rabbi Rosenberg who quickly moves to
help the old rabbi shuffle onto a SEGWAY SCOOTER that’s
leaned against the wall Once aboard Rabbi Twersky GLIDES
OFF down the hallway corridor

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 46

Aidan enters to find his father tubes in his nose and arm
He appears to be staring off at nothing

SAUL
Oh God Oh shit Shit shit
shit

AIDAN

Jesus Dad are you okay

Reveal Saul is watching a METS GAME on a wall mounted TV with
the sound off

SAUL
(gesturing to TV)
I’m fine but this shortstop
Cedeno is a Nazi pig-fucker You
know how to work the volume on this
thing

Aidan doesn’t move

SAUL (CONTD)
Come over here Don’t be fooled
by all this It’s all to cover
their asses so nobody gets sued
I’m fine

Aidan finds a chair at the bedside

AIDAN
So this experimental treatment

SAUL
They told me from the beginning it
doesn’t work for everyone I rolled
the dice

AIDAN
Did they give you any new
information Did they say

SAUL

How long Few months maybe a year
But if I died every time he said I
was gonna die I’d have more lives
than Shirley Maclaine

(re TV)

Jesus Did you see that pitch If
Collins doesn’t pull Ramirez out of
the bullpen soon I’m gonna yank all
these tubes and call it a day If
there’s one thing in life that’s
certain Aidan it’s that the Mets
will let you down

ON Aidan stares at his father who’s lost in the game

INT HOSPITAL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
Aidan emerges from the room Rosenberg is still there

RABBI ROSENBERG
Are you okay Mr Bloom You look a
little pale Maybe you should sit
down

AIDAN
I think I might throw up

RABBI ROSENBERG
Sit down

Aidan does Rosenberg joins him

RABBI ROSENBERG (CONT’D)
Look Aidan if there’s anything we
can do to support you please don’t
hesitate to let us know I lost my
father two years ago It was the
hardest thing I’ve ever gone
through It’s a very unsettling
time You’re entering a major
transitional stage of your life

AIDAN
I am

RABBI ROSENBERG
Yes Tell you what I’11 avoid the
Talmud for you Sigmund Freud
once said “A boy becomes a man not
at his bar-mitzvah but at the
death of his father”

Aidan takes this in

AIDAN
Thank you Rabbi Excuse me

Rosenberg watches Aidan walk off

EXT HOSPITAL PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

Aidan almost makes it to his car but suddenly stops and
VOMITS beside it He slumps down on the ground

EXT FROZEN FOREST - FANTASY 49

Aidan and JAX runs through the trees of a FROZEN FOREST
covered in ICE In the distance they see a warm orange glow

Gradually an OBJECT comes into view A GLOWING BAR OF LIGHT

As Aidan reaches down to touch it the bar GLOWS BRIGHTER
filling the frame as we burn into a WHITEOUT

INT AIDAN’S OFFICE - LATER - NIGHT 50
Aidan opens the pre-arrangement packet

The language of death flashes before his eyes Denial Anger
Burial Entombment Cremation Casket Open or closed Urn

SARAH (0S)
You alright

AIDAN
Yeah Well no I guess all is not
right You struggle your whole life
to have it all matter in some way
and ultimately in comes down to one
question in a stapled pamphlet
“How should we deal with your
bones”

SARAH
Maybe you shouldn’t be looking at
that yet babe

AIDAN

He drives me crazy sometimes But
that man is such a part of who I
am Seeing him hooked up to all
those machines I never wanted to
believe in God so badly So many
moments from our lives together
The happy times the vacations with
Mom even the fights good and
bad just life you know ups and
downs I just can’t believe one
day I’1l never see him again

Sarah gives him a kiss on the head

AIDAN (CONTD)
How are the kids

SARAH
They’re okay scared
(then)
I always wanted to have a better
handle on life’s mysteries by the
time we had kids So I could talk
to them with some certainty

AIDAN
Right I mean fuck if I know what
we’re supposed to be doing here

SARAH
As parents Or on Earth

AIDAN
Both I mean listening to what you
said tonight and now this I
never would have imagined I’d feel
so fucking lost at 35 There’s
never any answers just deeper
questions

SARAH
Maybe we learn these things when
the time is right

AIDAN
When a parent’s on his deathbed

SARAH
Or when you need to teach them to
your children

Aidan reacts to this has an idea

51 INT BEDROOMS - NEXT MORNING 51
A reinvigorated Aidan whips the covers off his sleeping kids

AIDAN
Wake up

TUCKER
What’s going on

AIDAN
Were going on a field trip

INT BLOOM HOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING 52
Aidan pulls a few bills out of the SWEAR JAR He slips a few

of the bills into an envelope he leaves on the counter He’s
about to leave but comes back and grabs the whole SWEAR JAR

EXT BLOOM HOUSE - LATER 53
Aidan CRANKS AN AMAZING SONG ON THE STEREO and backs the
fully loaded mini-van out of the driveway and speeds off

INT BLOOM HOUSE KITCHEN 54

Sarah stumbles in half-awake to find the envelope with “Swear-
Jar cash” and a note that reads

Took the kids camping for the night Use this to get a
Massage Love your naked wrestling partner

She smiles

INT MINIVAN - CONTINUOUS 55

GRACE
Is grandpa going to die

AIDAN
It looks that way honey

TUCKER
Are we gonna put him in the
backyard with Whiskers

AIDAN
No I don’t think we’re allowed to
do that We’ll have to ask Grandpa
what he wants

TUCKER
I think he’1ll wanna be with
Whiskers

Grace and Tucker look out their windows

EXT JOSHUA TREE - CAMP GROUND - EVENING 56

Aidan leaps from the car and heads up a boulder strewn
hillside the kids look after him - confused

GRACE
Shouldn’t we set up our camp

AIDAN
Later follow me

57 EXT ROCKY BLUFF - SUNSET 57
The kids scamper after Aidan as he scales the hillside

TUCKER
Seriously What are we doing way
out here

AIDAN
I just thought it would be good for
us Sometime’s it’s good to get out
of your environment Helps you get
some perspective on things

Atop a massive slab at the peak the SUN IS SETTING

AIDAN (CONTD)
This is it This is the spot

GRACE
What is it

AIDAN
This is the spot where I had the
deepest most sincere spiritual
experience of my life The last
time I had an epiphany it was here

TUCKER
What’s an aniffany

AIDAN

An epiphany is when you realize
something you really need to
realize Sometimes in life you can
get kinda stuck It’s like

(a thought)
Do you remember when you spilled
that rubber cement all over that
book you liked and we couldn’t turn
the pages cause they were all stuck
together

TUCKER
Yeah

AIDAN
Well sometimes when you’re a grown-
up it’s kinda like that You keep
trying to flip the page to the next
chapter but it’s stuck And you
feel like you should have changed
chapters by now but you can’t

GRACE
Are you stuck because Grandpas
dying

AIDAN

Yes That’s one of the reasons

GRACE
And cause you haven’t worked since
that dandruff commercial

AIDAN
That’s in there too thanks for
reminding me

TUCKER
Dad do we go in the sky when we
die

AIDAN
I don’t know buddy What do you
think

TUCKER

I think those stars are people’s
grandpas And the moon is where God
lives and he watches them to make
sure they’re happy

AIDAN
Wow That’s beautiful That was
like a poem

TUCKER
But it didn’t rhyme

AIDAN
A poem doesn’t have to rhyme
Remember I told you I studied
poetry in college

GRACE
I thought you studied acting
AIDAN
I did but poetry’s what got me
into acting Your grandma loved
poetry She used to recite poems to
me at my bedtime And poetry can
come in lots of different forms
Sometimes if you just say out loud
whatever comes to your head it can
be a poem

TUCKER
And then God comes down from the
moon to Earth to buy Reeses Pieces
and his finger glows cause he wants
to phone home

AIDAN
Ok now I think you’ve kind of
veered off into the plot of “ET”
But the first part was very nice
(beat)
Let’s make a fire

EXT ROCKY BLUFF - NIGHT

They sit around a fire toasting marshmallows

TUCKER
Will Grandpa be able to see us when
he dies

AIDAN

Nobody knows what happens when you
die buddy There’s as many
opinions as there are people

(re Grace)
And some of those people will tell
you with absolute certainty they
know what happens

GRACE
But they’re wrong

AIDAN
No They’re lucky in a way The
rest of us until we see an
answer we believe one that makes
sense we’re left with nothing

TUCKER
But how can you have nothing Can’t
you see the stars

AIDAN
I see them You’re right They’re
so beautiful aren’t they

TUCKER
Tell us a ghost story Dad

AIDAN
I don’t know any ghost stories How
about something Grandma used to say
to me before I went to bed

GRACE
Is it scary

AIDAN

No

(beat)
And indeed there will be time
For the yellow smoke that slides
along the street Rubbing its back
upon the window-panes There will
be time there will be time To
prepare a face to meet the faces
that you meet

A MONTAGE under Aidan’s VO they toast marshmallows

AIDAN (VO) (CONTD)
There will be time to murder and
create

They laugh they sing a song Aidan hugs Grace wrapped in a
blanket close-ups on little hands

AIDAN (VO) (CONT’D)
And time for all the works and days
of hands That lift and drop a
question on your plate

DISSOLVE Aidan appears to be acting out a scary story as the
fire dances His giant silhouette flits about the trees
EXT ROCKY BLUFF - LATER 59
Aidan sits in a camping chair by firelight The kids are

asleep behind him He smokes a joint and stares down at the
funeral questionnaire

visions and revisions Before the

for me to spend some real quality
time with these guys

things in that box like math and

reading They have to be able to
keep up with the other kids next

ahead of their peers And for

She crosses to him to look at his monitor

musical about it for God’s sake I
forgot what it was called

SARAH
I think it was just called “Cats”

ALAN
One ticket sold

SARAH
Listen can I talk to you about
something

Sure have a seat What’s on your
mind

SARAH
It’s just I’m having a little
trouble getting used to my cubicle

partner

ALAN
Jerry

SARAH
Yeah

ALAN

But he’s hilarious

SARAH
It’s just that some of his comments
are a little inappropriate and I
know I’m relatively new here and I
don’t wanna ruffle anyones
status quo But I do think it’s
time I told you that he’s making me
feel uncomfortable

ALAN
Did he try to touch you
inappropriately

SARAH
God no No it was more his
words
ALAN
What did he say

SARAH
Id really rather not say it

ALAN
Sarah I have to know what he said
so I can suss this thing out

SARAH
He said well for starters he
said that when he doesn’t wear
any underwear he gets little
“half-boners”

Alan tries as hard as he can but bursts out LAUGHING

ALAN
I’m so sorry Sarah But that is
hilarious You have to understand
that when we’re jangling around
down there anything can happen

SARAH

He also made it talk to me
ALAN

Who
SARAH

His half-boner

ALAN
What did it sound like

SARAH
I don’t know it was kind of high
pitched - almost like a ghost’s
voice

ALAN
(concerned)
Ok but he didn’t do like a Black
guy voice or anything did he He
didn’t do anything racial like a
Carl Weathers baritone kind of
thing

SARAH
No it was higher pitched Like a
mouse Or like I said a ghost

He smiles

ALAN
Like a ghost mouse

SARAH
Sure

ALAN
Look Sarah we have fun here And
I know that this place isn’t always
run according to the book But I
think you should loosen up a bit
Nobody’s trying to touch you
nobody’s giving their penis Black
people voices or saying things
like
(bad Asian impression)
“Me love you long time”
(back to normal voice)
Tell you what I’m gonna move your
cubicle I’1l tell Jerry to bring
it down a notch But you gotta
promise to smile a little more A
little more “Hakuna Matata

SARAH
I don’t know what that means

ALAN
It means “No worries for the rest
of your days”

SARAH
No I have two children I know
it’s from The Lion King I just
don’t understand how it applies to
the water department

ALAN
It means lighten up a little bit
Sarah You have something everybody
else wants

SARAH
Remind me what that is

ALAN
A job

constructing of a badass Hero from one of his video games

outfit Tucker plays with the dog

AIDAN
This should qualify as art class

JONAH
(to Grace)
Just keep cutting along all the
lines I drew This is for the chest

piece

AIDAN
I never knew you were into playing
dress-up

JONAH

It’s hardly playing dress up dude

Shepard from Mass Effect 3 like Im
about to First prize is a thousand
dollars not to mention the chance
for some congratulatory poon-tang

around 630 tonight and we’ll all
go over to see Dad together Right

JONAH
I don’t know Aidan I gotta finish
this and to be totally blunt I’m
not a huge fan of Saul

(MORE )

JONAH (CONTD)
My tolerance for being told I was a
disappointment every day of my life
had an expiration date

AIDAN
Do you know how many times a day he
directly or indirectly insults me
You just have to block it out

JONAH
I get it worse than you do Aidan
Come on you know that You at
least have a wife and a family
When he looks at me all he sees is
failure Mom believed in me it was
different when she was around She
made him a tiny bit nicer But
Dad I’ve never given him
anything he could brag about

GRACE
I’m sure he brags about you

JONAH
He’s never bragged about me a day
in his life And I don’t care
anymore He created me and for
that I owe him my life But when
he’s gone I won’t miss him

GRACE
Don’t you have any happy memories
of him

JONAH

The ‘86 Mets Watching USC

JONAH (CONTD)
Aidan

AIDAN
Weve both spent our whole lives

SAUL

loves him and supports him and will
remind him the answer if he
occasionally forgets

Grandpa I found these special
sunglasses for you Now you won’t

GRACE

SAUL
Aidan Come in here I’ve got
someone I want you to meet This is
one of my old students from
Princeton Came to pay me a visit
after all these years Hugh Foster

Aidan is taken aback by Saul’s verve He shakes Hugh’s hand

HUGH
Nice to meet you Your dad was my
favorite teacher So funny

AIDAN
Funny

But Saul waves him down

SAUL
(to Hugh)
Tell this one what you do for a
living
HUGH
I was just made west coast sales
manager for Apple

SAUL
The computers

Aidan smiles awkwardly

AIDAN
Wow Congratulations That’s a big
job

SAUL

Huge This guy Aidan He had a
natural talent for business All I
had to do was stay outta his way

HUGH
You were the one who always said we
should find our passion then hold
on tight and never let go

AIDAN
(sarcastic)
Classic Saul

Saul gives Aidan a look Hugh senses the tension

HUGH
Well I guess I should get going
SAUL
Of course You’re a busy man
(to Aidan)

Did you see the arrangement he
brought It’s got iPods hanging
from it like fruit Get it It’s an
Apple tree

HUGH
Get well Saul

Aidan watches as Hugh exits Sets down the box

AIDAN
I brought you the stuff you--

SAUL
Why the hell hasn’t your brother
come to see me

AIDAN
Good morning to you too

SAUL
Didn’t you tell him I’m circling
the drain over here

AIDAN

He has a money making opportunity
that he’s very excited about A
really good chance to make some
money He wanted me to tell you
that he’s really sorry Dad

SAUL

He’s probably cooking meth like the
dad from “Malcolm in the Middle”
Do you know when he was six years
old we thought something was wrong
with him

AIDAN
Please Dad I know the story

SAUL
A psychologist at his school gave
him this battery of tests When
they came out the psychologist
goes “He’s not disabled -- he’s a
genius”

Aidan smiles at the oft heard story

SAUL (CONTD)

I remember walking around going
about my business thinking that I
was the father of a genius Do you
have any idea how much pride I
felt

(then)
Such high hopes Now he snorts anti-
depressants in a trailer park

EXT MATADOR BEACH - DAY 80

Aidan and Jonah share a joint and stare out at the Pacific
The kids chase the dog through shallow tide

JONAH
I sit on this rock a lot Solved
most of the world’s problems a
hundred times on this rock

AIDAN
(with a smile)
Thanks for filling the rest of us
in on the answers

JONAH
Ah I’m usually baked out of my
face so they don’t make as much
sense once I leave the rock

They share a LAUGH Pass the joint

JONAH (CONTD)
Do you ever feel like every year
you get older the months go by
faster and faster

AIDAN
You say that like it’s coming to an
end or something

JONAH
It’s not ending but I do think
I’ve missed the chance to be
precocious at anything It’s kind
of hard to get excited about
anything if you’ve been told your
whole life you’re destined to fail

AIDAN
God you’re so stuck in the past
None of that shit matters at all
Youre crippling yourself with all
the things you think you’re
supposed to be I wish you’d just
let yourself be who you are

JONAH
How are you giving up the past
Youre still so consumed by being
fucked-with in high school that
youre actually trying to teach
your kids yourself

AIDAN
I was not “fucked-with” that bad

JONAH
Yes you were
(beat)
They tormented you I remember the
day you got beat up by like three
of them What was his name That
evil kid Ronnie something

AIDAN
Ronnie Buckman

JONAH

Fucking Ronnie Buckman I watched
the whole thing happen And I
remember you sobbing in the
kitchen And I’1l never forget mom
putting frozen meat on your black
eye I thought it was gross I
remember thinking “I hope we don’t
have to eat that now that it’s been
on Aidan’s bloody face”

(beat)
I should have helped you beat up
those kids But I never moved We
were such pussies That bothers me
most days

AIDAN
But that was twenty years ago
Jonah You have to move on from the
past What the fuck are you waiting
for So your Dad was a dick Find
me someone who doesn’t have pain
(beat)

We’1ll all be dead and gone one day
and the only thing that will have
mattered is if we showed-up when it
was time So be a man and show up
It’s quite literally now or never

Aidan walks off

A larger wave brings the tide high enough to almost touch
Jonah’s feet He quickly moves away so the water doesn’t
touch him THE SOUND OF THE TIDE OVERLAPS INTO

Aidan in FULL SPACE SUIT AND HELMET walks through the eerily
desolate green fluorescent-lit halls of his own high school
He looks around unsure why he’s here JAX the FLYING ROBOT
SIDEKICK BEEPS for Aidan to follow him

Around the corner Aidan sees a GRAINY PROJECTION of HIS
YOUNGER SELF getting the shit kicked out of him by ANOTHER
BOY A DOZEN KIDS stand around cheering the bully on

TIGHT ON AIDAN’S FACE through his HELMET THE REFLECTION of
the fight dances on the GLASS FACE MASK as AIDAN watches

EXT MATADOR - CONTINUOUS 82

Aidan snaps out of his fantasy He has waded out waist-deep
into the ocean He looks back to the beach where his kids are
building a sand castle WE HEAR THE SOUND OF A YOUNG BOY
SINGING A JEWISH PRAYER

INT TEMPLE SANCTUARY - DAY 83

REVEAL the SINGING is coming from a YOUNG BOY standing on the
stage of the sanctuary He is being tutored for his Bar
Mitzvah by Rabbi Rosenberg Aidan enters from the back They
make eye contact

RABBI ROSENBERG
Avi go practice in my office for a
moment I’ll be with you ina
minute
He leaves

AIDAN
I’m not here to convert

RABBI ROSENBERG
Good cause I’ve already met my
quota

He smiles

RABBI ROSENBERG (CONT’D)
Have a seat

They sit in the front row of the sanctuary

AIDAN
You know I was kosher until I was

RABBI ROSENBERG
Really

AIDAN
My father told me I was officially
aman at my Bar Mitzvah

(MORE)
AIDAN (CONTD)
So I told him that as a man I
wanted to have a bacon double
cheeseburger I think I saw his
mind explode

They both smile

AIDAN (CONTD)

But to his credit he let me eat
whatever I wanted outside of the
house I guess I impressed him with
my logic

RABBI ROSENBERG
What brings you to temple Aidan

AIDAN
When we were kids my brother and I
used to pretend we were Space Men
We’d go out into the woods behind
our house in Jersey and pretend it
was some mystical planet and we
were the only ones who could save
everybody

RABBI ROSENBERG
From what

AIDAN
What

RABBI ROSENBERG
What were you saving them from

AIDAN
I don’t know some scary shadowy
figure Anyway I’ve been thinking
about that a lot lately Imagining
those things again for the first
time in 25 years

RABBI ROSENBERG
What do you think it means

AIDAN
I don’t know I almost feel
embarrassed to say this out loud
but do you think maybe God is
trying to tell me something guide
me in some way And if you say he
works in mysterious ways I’m gonna
run out that door

RABBI ROSENBERG

(smiles)
Maybe your brain is tired of you
not listening to it so it’s begun
to articulate things for you in a
new way You’re losing your father
You’re looking for something
Youre on a quest for some kind of
connection to the universe

(beat)
Do you feel any spiritual
connection at all To anything

AIDAN
Space The infinite Looking up at
the sky with my kids and trying to
explain to them the infinity of the
universe How we’re these tiny
little ants on this tiny little
planet I feel a spiritual power in
that infinity Could that be God

RABBI ROSENBERG
God can be whatever you want him to
be You’re getting tangled in
semantics Try not to get caught up
in the God who wants you to be
kosher and the God who wants you to
study the Torah Start with God as
the infinite universe and imagine
that that force may be trying
desperately to guide you through
the most challenging part of your
life Even if it has to appear to
you in the form of a space man to
get you to listen

Aidan smiles

AIDAN
Wow You’re like the coolest Rabbi
I’ve ever met Where have you been
hiding

RABBI ROSENBERG
Aidan it seems to me there are
lots of things in your life that
are right in front of you that
youve been too busy to notice

ON AIDAN taking this in

84 INT SAUL’S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 84

Sarah stands staring out the window Saul awakes He’s
startled to see her

SARAH
Did I scare you

SAUL
I thought if I ever saw you here
alone you’d be putting a pillow
over my face

She smiles

SARAH
I’ve been watching the paramedics
come and go for the last half-hour
It’s fascinating every few minutes
they race in at full speed
frantically pull a gurney out race
inside doing everything they can
possibly do to save someone’s
life and then a few minutes
later they all come outside and
smoke cigarettes

SAUL
You never really think about death
until you’re here chemicals

pumping into your veins while you
watch “The View” I’m unclear which
one is killing me faster

(beat)
Why are you here alone

SARAH
Aidan’s teaching the kids how to
parallel park I thought I’d come
say hi

SAUL
Hi Welcome to purgatory Have a
seat Can I offer you some saline

He holds out his IV Sarah smiles
SARAH

I’m glad to see you’re keeping your
sense of humor

SAUL
What else am I supposed to do
Eventually when things get tragic
enough they circle back to comedy

She sits down on the chair beside his bed and unfurls his
curling hand

SARAH
Did I ever tell you that when I
lost my sister you were the most
helpful person to me

SAUL
Really I mean I’m glad if I was
but I don’t even remember what I
said

SARAH
You said something like “Nothing
in life will call upon you to be
more brave than facing the fact
that it ends But on the other side
of that heartbreak is wisdom”

SAUL
I said that

SARAH
Yes

SAUL

(with a smile)
That was good advice And now here
I am a shiva waiting to happen

Sarah smiles

SARAH
Well the wisdom that came for me
was that the things we leave unsaid
will stay with us forever I wanted
so badly to tell my sister how much
I loved her and how I always
idolized her but we never said
those things we weren’t like
that And then suddenly she was
gone

SAUL
Both my boys know how I feel

SARAH
Are you sure about that Saul
Saul considers this but

SAUL
Achh They don’t need me to make
this more dramatic They’d roll
their eyes at me

SARAH
I think you’d be surprised

SAUL
So what is this Did you come here
to tell me I failed as a father

SARAH

No Not at all One parent could
never say that to another I mean
I gotta be honest with you I have
no idea what I’m doing as a parent
I’m just DVR’ing Oprah and kinda
making it up as I go along

(beat)
But what you did was raise two
incredible men Saul They don’t
have quick answers or awards on
their mantles (in fact neither
one of them even has a mantle)

(she smiles)
But they’re incredible men And
right now they need their father
They need to know he loves them
before it’s too late

Saul frowns thoughtfully

Saul nods

SARAH (CONTD)
Barbara used to help you with the
hard part of parenting

SAUL
(his eyes well)
Yeah She brought out the best in
me

SARAH
You need to bring out your best one
last time Saul Aidan’s going to
remember this time for the rest of
his life It’s going to shape him
as a man

matriarch someday

heroes We were Superhero Space Men
with swords that could save the
day Perhaps we set the bar a
little high Maybe we’re just
regular people the ones who get
saved

(he smiles through tears)

when he listened to their marching
band play the fight song So this

doubt that you can hear this but

taking it how unbelievable perfect his life has become
