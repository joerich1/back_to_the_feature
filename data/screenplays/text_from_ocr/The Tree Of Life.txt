PART ONE
EXT OBRIEN HOUSE

An ordinary house in central Texas A neighborhood at the
edge of town

Three children -- brothers -- are playing in the back yard
The eldest 11 is JACK RL is two years younger and STEVE
is 6 Their MOTHER and FATHER Mr and Mrs OBrien look on-

In the center of the yard stands a tall oak tree The year is

OTHER ANGLES

The boys play with their dog SHEP Their mother smiles
content Life has covered her with blessing There is nothing
she sees but it means her good

Her heart it seems is especially drawn to her middle son
the sweetest most genial of the boys

The sun is setting in the west A doorbell rings

EXT OBRIEN HOUSE - TWELVE YEARS LATER

Twelve years later a Western Union man walks away from the
house Mrs OBrien leans against a wall as she reads a
telegram

INT OBRIEN HOUSE

Mr OBrien watches s his wife stares out the window

FATHER
Can I do anything

She shakes her head She lets him kiss her but generally
seems unaware of him She notices nothing says nothing

He must be strong There will be time enough for tears He
grieves for her more than for himself -- that she should be
stricken in this way a woman so faithful kind and upright --
who through the whole of her life has denied herself -- who
has loved the good -- given to the poor comforted the
desolate A flashforward Men rise up and bow when she passes
by

INT OBRIEN HOUSE

Friends have come to visit
BETTY
You did everything in the world to
make him happy No one could have
had a better life

JAN
He was such a fine boy

RUTH
-- Such a fine musician The
sweetest child I ever saw

BETTY
He only goes a little before the
rest of us

RUTH
Its all so bitter now but--
youll have lovely memories of him
Those cant be taken away

The memories are a torment to her not a consolation

JAN
Hell always Live in your heart

Live That is what he will not do

BETTY
We never really part Not from
those we love

JAN
The fain Wil pass away

She does not want i ‘to No she wants to keep it always A
shard of glass in her heart

RUTH
Hes at peace

Let them live in their naive illusion If only she still
could To hear his name spoken is more than she can bear
Does no ons understand

Now when others look at her they glance quickly away She
is aware of being an uncomfortable presence to everyone she
meets particularly when she speaks

BETTY
»»-Hes in Gods hands now
Where is God Where was he then Nature gives no answer
whispers not a word The child was in Gods hands the whole
time was he not

JAN
-He didnt suffer Hes better
off where he is Its so hard --
you can do everything right and
still --

Their voices seem far away as though they were speaking to
her through a tunnel Let them talk to each other Not to
her

A vast barren plain Death reveals the enptiness that was
there before

Nothing is but it The fact is like a wall She can see
nothing else Nothing beyond

Shattered so many lives cast blindly here and there like
water from rock to rock

INT OBRIEN HOUSE

She cannot look in his room When she does he dies to her a
second time She paces before the closed door

INT OBRIEN HOUSE
Her would-be comforters go away dismayed and apprehensive
Why she and not they” They are themselves bewildered some
reduced to tears
JAN
The best woman in the whole town
RUTH
There may be things that we dont

know

BETTY (0S)
She still has two left

She overhears their voices after they are gone How much more
easily they speak as soon as they are out of her presence

Not just her child -- it seems that all creation has died
Nature has betrayed the heart that loved it

A child appears with a casserole
BOY
Mom sent this

He quickly retreats his eyes fixed on the ground

In the next room Mr OBrien laughs and shakes his head He
does not seem quite to have taken it all in

FATHER
That rascal I remember how you
couldnt get him into the tub
Then once he was in you couldnt
get him back out

The grey dawn of the next day The O’Brien house seems no
different from any other on the bleck The gostman goes about
his business The paperboy

The men of the neighborhood speak among ‘hemsSelves in hushed
voices as they set their sprinklers out at dusk The fall of
the OBrien house strikes awe in them A family once happy
and prosperous brought down in sorrow and doom

TIGHT ON MRS OBRIEN

Through a crack in the bedroom door she sees her husband on
his knees What good has it brought him Would he pray to a
spider

Gardenias a climbing rose Nature puts forth life at will
Why should a dog have breath her child none

Later when someone reaches for the childs guitar she hears
her husband insist hat if not be moved Not an inch

MR OBRIEN
Her husband too attempts to console her But having an
equal cause for sorrow he is no more convincing than her

friends have been

Grief so deep has made her unfamiliar to him almost holy
Still he must say something

FATHER
We have -- to be strong -- for them
-- for the other boys We cant let

‘them see --

(she looks away)
I havent been the husband you
deserve - I havent loved you
enough -- still -- let me into your
heart Let us share the grief
FATHER (CONTD)
Its too hard alone I thought we
would go first -- never have to
know -- to see --

(she looks up)
I wish it could have been me I
took the confidence out of him I
never got a chance to tell him --
how sorry I was I made him unhappy
-- anxious -- I did it out of love
Forgive me

She hesitates waits until she can swallow back a sob to
speak -- then can find nothing to say What did they do to
bring such a calamity on themselves What did the world gain
It neither knew nor cared

FATHER (CONTD)

Im going to be strong for him
Thats what hed want and ‘thats
what hes going to get

An empty swing A slide A bridge Grass fading in the August
heat

He takes her into his arms How small their differences seem
now He loves her wholly They are one at last in grief

MOTHER (0S)
Do we say we have three boys or
two
(in a whisper)
I hate my life -- I want to die --
to” with him -- my child

She will not be consoled Ye looks at her helpless
MOTHER (CONTD)
(sa ddenly)

Whatever TL say dont believe it
Alone she prays She hears no answerind voice
Mr OBrien closes the lid of his piano
Her soul is gone Her good She goes about her life she
walks eats sleeps wakes up But she does not live Each
place each hour is the same
The best of her lay in his soul She lived through him saw
through his eyes Apart from him she cannot see the work of
God or natures order In her is death im him was life

A bare tree in winter Nature lied
JACK (ADULT) - SERIES OF ANGLES

Gradually we become aware of Jack their eldest son grown up
now The others have tried and failed to console his mother
How shall he

JACK (0S)
It broke your heart Never
afterwards were you the same —-
your faith in goodness shaken --
though carefully you kept it
secret lest our faith be shaken
too

(she walks alone)
In vain’ We knew

Gone He has left the world a shams A friend whispers in Mrs
OBriens ear

MRS STONE
Dont let them console you Dont
forget For a long time youll have
the pain But it will turn to joy --
in the end

We are aboard a train plunging through the countryside the
locomotive far ahead barely visible A blind overwhelming
force

JACK (0S8)
Why do you grieve and waste away
You 3e love flowed out

un lyt

The rails weave in and out beneath the wheels The steel
lines of fate I runs along its way defies all other paths
all walls crashes through every obstacle

She cannot be persuaded to turn or look She sits with her
face averted staring at the ground

Each day she finds it harder to bear She cannot read or
sleep The dawn light coming in through the window is ghastly
to her It is as though he had died again And- yet she would
not be surprised if he were to walk into the room

Children play Spring comes The crocus raise their heads
The redbuds blaze They return

A door through which one fears to look A path one shrinks
from taking Empty parks A vast neglected garden A gate
The past consuming all
Decaying statues in a long straight lane of trees The
figures of forgotten gods They gaze at the horizon as though
in search of their deliverer Balustrades a drained pool
Walks strewn with sodden leaves Stairs that lead nowhere A
butterfly

She remembers when the sun shone about her when it seemed
that she would die in her nest

Crows hovering over a stubble field foraging in the furrows

JACK (0S) (CONTD)
Who are you that took him You
smash what is most dear -» send
flies to wounds you might have
healed Who can hindér you

Friends come by less She does not mind Her child is more
present to her in death than really they in life

Good night my child She shall not see him Till heaven and
earth have passed away

Sent for nothing The faces of those who live on strangers
preferred to him

‘High overhead migrating geese call to each other separated
lost in the clouds

A buoy clanging in the fog
Nature has returned to chaos

A hand on a curtain What is death What will it be like The
pictures stop The movie ends

Jack stops on the Street listens It is as though the wind
were trying to tell him something

He finds himself on a staircase its upper and lower reaches
lost in the darkness

JACK (0S) (CONTD)
You whom we met in the woods and on
the hills whom first in her eyes
we knew -- how shall I name you

CUs to show his mothers air of embarrassed shyness her good
humor and truthfulness her affectionate sorrowing face
always looking into him wishing him strength and happiness
Her hands when she is very old those worn hands that once
held so much that was dear to them that once he could take
and hold as tightly and for as long as he wished Soon he
must lose her too with all he Loves

Change the spring of all sorrow Is anything exempt from
birth growth and decay Nothing everlasting

A shadow dancing on the ground This world is passing away

His father who at first was careful to remain calm and
composed rips off his coat and tears at his hair in grief

JACK (CONTD)
Teach me the way to you

The oak tree in the front yard Its roots fgach down into the
darkness of the earth towards its cember Qnd source The
branches spread towards the light towards discovery and
utterance a fountain of life

JACK (0S) (CONTD)
Brother dear brother -- We had one
heart within us One soul -- where
you left off and I began I could
not tell

The immovable trunk a universe of leaves spreading above it
whispering an oracle

JACK (0S) (CONTD)
Wher are you How shall I find you
again “TL will go in search of you -
through all he worlds

The camera riseS throu gh the branches seeks a way towards
the sky above

JACK (0S) (CONTD)
Brother speak through me Guide
me Answer me from where you are
See what I was what I am now Lend
your spirit to this song

He discovers himself on the verge of falling asleep at the
wheel of a car He fights to stay awake The car is drifting
off the road and still he cannot rouse himself to
consciousness to the required act of will

A hand touches his shoulder waking him —-
EXT CITY OF DESTRUCTION - THE ARTIFICIAL WORLD - LATE DAY TO
NIGHT TO DAWN - JACK (ADULT)

Jack wakes to find himself in that landscape of paralysis and
despair which today goes by the name of a city The familiar
world has assumed a threatening aspect

A number of scenes with the adult Jack follow encounters with
friends and strangers To avoid interrupting the flow of the
narrative we will not specify them here’ From time to time
we hear Jacks thoughts He leads us through the story

The cutting is quick and staccato to suggest the fractured
quality of modern life
His eyes are bright with longing He never lingers anywhere
for long but is forever off forever moving on Where did he
go wrong or wander from the path

The stars are washed out The sky is a haze The moon shines
down like any other senseless light high above the towers of
steel and glass Where in these streets can he find any
evidence of the worlds order any sign to help him on his
way

The others do not meet his eyes Each makes his way alone
shut up within himself None can be sure of the other No tie
is fixed or lasting

Like a bird trapped inside a room beating against the
windows and ceiling the soul struggles for a time then
sinks down in defe

The buildings hem him round like the trees ofa wild forest
A false natures and universe of death A sightless world
roofed over shut off from things above Here one must stoop
to walk A world that Would exclude the transcendent that
says I am and there is nothing else A world without love

It seems he could escape if only he could bring himself to
will it Somehow he cannot He has gone to sleep he cannot
wake up He wakes from one dream to another

The sights of a modern city it could be Chicago New York
Houston Paris Mumbai Los Angeles or a composite of them

all We never see it whole -- no skyline or defining monument
-- fragments only -- a frenzy of things and people on the
move -- a continuous flow of trains and cars -- a new Babel

Change seems the only constant in this city disappearance
loss Being is a shadow There is nothing but this endless
flux Nothing eternal nothing sure

In the faces of strangers that anguished look of our times
which betrays itself beneath the smiles and courtesy --
which increasingly even children wear

Each a shadow to the other each with his own eyes fixed on
the ground in front of him absorbed in his private world
Spectators in a movie theater

JACK
Sweet brother -- you who filled our
hearts with light -- who drew us
close who made us one a family
a home -- gone Into the night
which has no dawn

He stops listens The grey light of television flickers on
the ceiling of a lonely apartment Somewhere a couple rage
and howl at each other

Time lapse shots of tall buildings with clouds passing above
them Hallways Offices at night Walls

JACK (CONTD)

What was it that you pointed to —-
knew better than I You overlooked
insult and injury Were gentle
kind --

Nothing adds up or leads to anything else He lives in
succession

The shadows of passersby on the street A dry streambed A
garden in winterThe stiff dead stalks of sunflowers their
heads bowed in defeat

JACK (0S) (CONTD)
Speakilet me hear -- see Let it
not have been in vain Sing with me
-- through me -- you the true
artist -- lend me your strength

- Everything conspires to lead one to go on as before TO rest
in the tomb To sleep

The concrete banks of the LA river Nature is dying
Without nature will the spirit die The eye flits here and
there like a frightened bird

The others guess nothing of his condition and he speaks not
a word What would he say

Fog from the beach Faces indistinct
“ii

MOTHER (O0S)
I knew such things happened but --
it seemed they wouldnt touch me I
could have been with him --

Her voice fades out and she is gone In a moment of fantasy
he finds himself swept along in a river The waters rise
threatening to engulf him

Now he finds himself inside a burning house Smoke slides in
under the door Flames peel the paint from the ceiling He
stuffs his fist in his mouth to keep from screaming The
others neither speak nor act as though they lay under some
spell or enchantment

A stranger with a Walkman A driver in a traffic jam

JACK Losing you I lost-my way-

Physical life in a world abandoned by the spirit Organized
unreality The soul a hindrance in ones dealings here A
burden A mere quantity of thoughts and desires

One is without form and void Thousand-minded At odds with
himself A miscellany not a man

Cold public works The city the lost creation the cosmos
become a cave

Travelers on a New York subway
All await a new Creation None knows how to bring it forth

He finds himself of an Grliner It skims over the tops of
the trees rising aod falling struggling to stay aloft It
flies under power lineS narrowly avoids houses and apartment
buildings The other passengers have gone to sleep or pay no
attention

The roar of the senses Loud ever louder Sensation becomes
substance The false world so surrounds us that it taken the
place of nature

This is a new death death of the spirit extinction of the
soul

The supreme misery to be cheated of the sight of essence to
find oneself abandoned to the busy dance of things which pass
away

What is despair but to lose the eternal

Forms dissolve like thoughts like shapes in a waterfall
Newspaper headlines Fragments of TV shows Swarming facts

Walls security lights traffic A dark empty cathedral

Where are you to find the spring and source of life Will you
die before you do

VOICE (0S)

Lead me from the unreal to the real
Lead me from darkness to light
Lead me from death to eternal life

To what end is nature Is there nothing but this chaos this
congeries of scraps and fragments No ing -which binds them
together

A new hell entirely of our times a glass box The sky is
covered over Man has shut himself in

He must find a way out He must journey through time from
the outward and external to the heart of creation

A solitary tree in the middle of a parking lot A clock A
closed door A porch light A lame man limping down the
street The images follow on each other in quick succession
The sound snaps in and out

He finds himself on a high building He leaps off the edge
into thin air without giving a thought to how he might
survive the fall He wakes up with a gasp

A figure stands neor him He cannot see its face but he
feels a strange peace flow into him a sense of radiant love
Who are you Jack seemS 4» ask Why can I not come to you

The figure points towards a gate Beyond it lies a field
Trembling Jack looks back towards the city

Come out the figure seems to say There is that near you
which will guide you if only you trust its lead

The figure reaches out touches the crown of Jacks head
then is gone

Jack looks around Where to begin

Night lifts off like a fog The street lamps flicker out The
morning star burns in a gap between the tall buildings -
solitary unheeded -- a promise of that world which here is
but a legend

You -- who are you The star seems to address him

Beneath the artificial world the true face of creation
covered over obscured beckoning us still

He closes his eyes He would rather sleep than undertake the
necessary struggle He awaits a command that has already been
given

Let us sing a new song tell a new story one which mindful
of the ancient tales takes its inspiration from science

Let us search for the permanent amid the fleeting and
mutable for that which endures through the spectacle of
ceaseless change Let us discover the eternal the good

Jack walks along the Santa Monica Shore Surfers bob up and
down in the line-up Children play in Whe -Hide Their
laughter their wild cries take him back o the past to his
childhood and beyond it to the worlds own -- to the first
light of creation

At the edge of the city he sees a tree He reaches out to
touch it The instant he does the universe springs up from
its source

THE CREATION

We show the growth of the cosmos the great epic of
evolution from the Big Bang through the long ages of
geological time down to the present day

We begin in the chaos or nothingness out of which space and
time arose - in a réalm beyond our power to imagine without
form or coherence void of here and now Suddenly like joy
replacing sadness and brooding light breaks forth and the
universe is horn

Molecular clouds gather to make galaxies which sail out
through the void like ships on a sea without shores New
stars new worlds are born and pass away like wasted seed
They are the furnaces in which the elements of our future
life are smelted Many experiments must be tried and rejected
before our system is hit upon much labor expended with
continual improvements through the long ages

At last the ancestral earth appears a bulb of gases more
like a star than a planet seared by the suns fire glowing
like a coal from deep within

The gases cool to liquid A solid core falls out a thin
crust forms From time to time the vapors clear away to
reveal a mighty inferno of magma and pitch

The sky fills with steam Rains fall for millennia cooling
the surface by degrees For ages there is no clear day of
sun no night of stars only thunder and lightning But by
and by the mists drift off the clouds part and the first
land appears a low island of meteoritic rubble and stark
volcanic stone

With no plants to hold the land in place wind and water
carve the stone into fantastic shapes Shadows move
mathematically over the hills The vast wastes wait for
nothing Each day is like the last

In the boiling waters of a hot spring entities develop that
can maintain their integrity in thefag¢e of disturbance from
without They do not endure by maintaining their rigidity
They are soft and yielding They resist change by themselves
changing endlessly likea whirlpool ‘inventing variations on
themselves which protect them from injury and accident and
gradually create a world more favorable 0 their growth

We cannot tell precisely when or how life begins It comes
not as a unique event at a precise stroke of the clock The
first living things are simple thermophiles odd marginal
forms neither plant nor animal barely over the indefinable
line which separates the animate from the inanimate

They drift in solitude through the vast lifeless sea
beneath the incandescent skies of a planet still racked by
volcanic eruptions and menaced by the impact of comets and
asteroids

In areas protected from the wind colonies of bacteria appear
as scums and muds ‘tinting the shores along the water-
courses like balhtub rings They have no predators death is
something yet unknowns

Microbial mats appear at the edges of the tides They in turn
give rise to stromatolites hard chalky knobs of rock
shaped like cabbages or cauliflowers the architecture of
generations of cyanobacteria living on top of each other
like coral in a reef

Bacteria that once preyed on each other learn gradually to
live in community As such communities become hereditary the
first cells with a nucleus arise Together the bacteria
arrive at a result which none by itself could have achieved

From the beginning cooperation plays as great a part as
competition in the ascent of life It succeeds where naked
power and selfishness do not making the deadliest enemies
indispensable to each others survival The struggle for
existence is not lifes sole or fundamental law

Slowly the bacteria creep inland spreading over the volcanic
debris like a layer of felt Plants magic jewel boxes of
chlorophyll soon abound Instead of drawing nourishment from
their surroundings they produce it for themselves
transforming sunlight and carbon into living tissue

Photosynthesis has made life self-sufficient just at the
moment it was living on borrowed time in danger of eating up
every particle of nourishment in the sea Now life can
manufacture its own food -- no longer depend on getting it
already made from a source outside itself

Some of the plants lacking chlorophyil find it easier to
prey on others than to manufacture Meir own nourishment from
lean water and sunlight Thus the First ani mals arise life
robbing life assassins

Alien as they appear they show the beg innings of need of
purpose and will the unmistakable marks Of identity the
first true signs of self Something new has taken root in
nature something which is not driven by external forces but
set in motion from within prompted by itself and nothing
else

Colonies of animals arise in which the functions of life are
cleverly divided Multicellular creatures spread through the
seas using every foothold they can find to establish an
existence no matter how narrow or constraining it might at
first appear

We see the creation not as an event in the distant past the
result of a finish and forgotten act but rather as
something which happéts in every moment of time no less a
miracle now ths presno hour than it was in the beginning

The film is like asteve sifting the seed from the husk of
appearances the changeless from the changing

Volvox sponges sea fans anemones corals and jellyfish
the creatures fill the newly hospitable waters in
inexhaustible numbers There are no fish as yet no crabs or
shrimp or lobster And yet it is an age of unparalleled
opportunity for the first time now and never again a world
free of competition The wildest fancies are permitted
anything can find a place Bizarre beings spring up from the
seas imagination then vanish forever Hallucingenia
Opabinia Anomalocaris

Segmented worms appear and after them the first vertebrates
simple fish Spines and jaws allow the vertebrates to leave
the sea floor to give up grubbing in the mud for nourishment
in order to prey on larger creatures

Predators shape their prey driving them to develop stronger
armor greater dexterity and speed Wondrous fact that had
life not been compelled to face the threat of a violent
death it might never have risen above the ooze

Death comes as a late arrival to the creation to give life a
greater capability and scope -- paradoxically to make it
stronger and more lasting

The light flashes at the waters surface above beckoning us
higher Algae spread up from the sea Mosses and liverworts
appear Here on land the plants need not contend for light
They seem to rejoice in their new independence to reach out
with the vigor of beings unexpectediv set free By and by
the hills are carpeted with a mat of diminutive green
vegetation

Frost and lichens break down the rocks into a soil fit for
the more developed plants still waiting by the shore-

Horseshoe crabs come up onto the shore to lay their eggs Sea
water rich as beer froths and foams around them Where
before there was no sound of life now we hear the faint
familiar choir of insects Millipedes forage on the mud
flats Scorpions and ghost crabs come out of the surf to prey
on them Silverfish follow and soon winged relatives are in
evidence With the power of flight the insects can range far
and wide in search of food scatter their seed and escape
their enemies though as yet no enemy has appeared

Is nature mere weather doing and undoing without end’ What
does it work toward What purpose does it have in view

Nothing stands still or keeps its place All is growth and
ceaseless unfolding One force works in all advancing
swiftly from form to form never lingering in any single one
forever rushing 695 Witnin all things but not enclosed
outside all but not excluded

From time to time lest we forget that we are sharing our
heros perspective we cut back to Jack in the city going
through the motions of his everyday life

The first fishes with amphibian traits gain the shore Swamp
and marshland have replaced the wide windy plains of the
preceding ages The forms of vegetation are simple few
There are no reeds or grasses No flower breaks the gloom
The earth is a vast wet Eden Except near the poles there
are no seasons Each year is like the last

Reptiles emerge from the amphibians and dinosaurs in turn
from the reptiles Among the dinosaurs we discover the first
signs of maternal love as the creatures learn to care for
each other

Is not love too a work of the creation What should we have
been without it How had things been then

Silent as a shadow consciousness has slipped into the world

The plant kingdom too advances as the first seed plants
emerge cycads araucarias conifers and gingkos Exalting
music alternates with long stretches of peaceful sound wind
and waves and summer crickets

Nature seems everywhere to be leading toward something Why
this delay in arriving at its ends Why does it feel its way
along -- wander dawdle delay Why twist and turn and
backtrack as though it were findinQ its way through a maze
Why establish hindrances and obstadlé only to put itself to
the trouble of devising stratagems for overcoming them

Mammals peer out from their hiding places iM the trees
waiting for the cold of night to descend and reduce the
reptiles to inactivity None is larger than a squirrel few
larger than a mouse They are a thin precarious line --
inconspicuous in the general landscape holding on against
great odds in constant danger of being extinguished
altogether

This is the fate that befalls the dinosaurs instead as a
large asteroid slams into the earth covering it for years in
a pall of dust The plants die off the larger reptiles
starve For long years the earth lies fallow Gradually the
mammals come forth to take up those niches which the
dinosaurs have left vacant

Nature seems to waste and blunder cruelly And yet except
for this disaster the dinosaurs might have dominated the
earth down to he present day How strange that calamity and
disease should lead life forward -- prove indispensable to
its unfolding -- that such grandeur should rise up from a
foundation of pain and death and ruin

The ichneumon wasp the crocodile the shark -- to think that
they too were the fruit of long painstaking labor and
calculation -- brought forth with an equalcare To think

that they now go patiently about their tasks burning with a
life as real as ours

Grasses and modern birds now make their appearance soon
thereafter the first primates At last we come to man the
triumph of the earth paragon of creatures and miracle of
miracles He walks with head aloft his shoulders broad and
strong his gaze fixed on the heavens the crown and glory of
creation

We suggest in quick succession the steps by which he moved
from a life of nomadic savagery to a settled stable culture

He tames the reindeer and the wild sheep He thatches his
roof to keep out the shafts of rain He draws furrows through
the earth and guides the water to his fields

What a short time our race has occupied this globe what a
late arrival we are after all -- a beginning -- creatures
more of the future than of the past An unspeakably great
future it might be and yet though nature should be
sufficient to our wants we have set ourselves against it
and against each other

Everything sings in the great chorus each knows its place
and is happy Man alone does not hy Evénnow we live in
the first day The splendor of natures distant beginning
shines within us Yet somehow we have lost our way

Tares stand among the grain bright red poppies thistles and
thorns The ravaged earth The ruins of ancient cities Great
walls thrown down by war Dry abandoned wells The stone
head of some ancient god buried to his neck in sand A
temple engulfed by the sea

‘Why does the world lie broken and in heaps Where did it all
go wrong

Our hero is left if not quite where he was before
nevertheless in doubt and misgiving He trusted nature to
answer his questions It answers some but raises others in
turn

We have lost the eternal -- within us and without How did it
first come to pass Now does it happen even now today in
the life of each and all

A ladder leading up into a tree A spring running from a
rock A rose

How shall we recover the eternal whichincreasingly we seek
for without knowing how we should

PART TWO

EXT SHORE HOUSE BRIDGE GATE SPARKS ETC - BOMARZO
COLLODI BAGNAIA ETC - STARLINGS

Fast wide-angle shots the tempo quick and lively after the
adagio of nature

A shore Beyond it a dark unbounded plain Figures in the
mist Souls as yet unborn Children of all races five or
six years old Before them stands a burning lamp

They press towards it each holding a candle which he lights
at the source One by one cupping the flame they go out of
the darkness

An ancient garden enclosed by a wall A peacock Water flows
from the mouth of a gargoyle in the center of the garden and
runs down into a pool They drink from it

They pass through a gate Cross a bridge
EXT TUNNEL CAVE BOOK MEASURING STICK - ICELAND

The souls keep close together Presently OMe comes forward
from among the rest a boy Helpers -- we Cannot see their
faces -- whisper in his ear One motions him to come towards
a door He hesitates

A woman in a bridal gown her face covered by a veil shows
him her wedding ring a field of sunflowers gives him a tiny
book which he must eat

EXT TREES PORCH LIGHT RIVER POV COMING OUT OF CAVE

In quick cuts the child looks back at the house from which
he came Already it seems far away

He sees the porch light of his future home Moths hover about
the yellow lamp Dust floats up from their wings

A figure whispets in his ear - A hand motions him forward Now
he stands by a Wide river His POV as though from a boat
coming out of the darkness of a sea-cave into the light

EXT OBRIEN HOUSE

We return to the opening of the movie to the tall oak tree
in front of the OBriens house

A thousand ages to lay down a bed of mud a thousand more to
shape a leaf or build a tree -- and all this Labor to prepare
a living soul

The soul the crown and apex of creation the self the
center and inside of nature Great not in space and time but
in capacity in depth and power of apprehension Where does
it come from When is it first born How does it advance
Towards what

How does it happen that I am I and you are you

The slow dark birth of the soul -- greater more mysterious
than the birth of worlds

A darkened house The night throbs with crickets A moonlit
window A curtain whispers over thesash A visitor A sound
of thrashing cloth

CULDOSCOPY —- EMBRYO - WARM LOVING MUSIC

The first signs of life the punctum saliens the hearts
germ and precursor beating in sharp throbs Systole
diastole Slowly the fetus grows coheres Feet eyes
fingernails Nature so prodigal with wonders outside us has
placed the greatest within

A boy Fed by his mothers blood he sleeps in the warm night
of her body

Tight on his ear listening to the sounds of the world
beyond Somewhere there is laughter Bells are ringing Still
he drowses

INT SUBMERGED ROOM - SPECIAL SET — LIT FLOOR LAMP ETC

The waters surface beckons Loving voices whisper
encouragement to him What world lies up there -- unguessed
unseen Slowly he rises towards it His hand feels here and
there pushes at a door taps -- tap tap --

The womb -- that snctuary where all his wants were known and
answered -- has hetome a prison a tomb He must break out
whatever the cost He can delay no longer Forward out of
the night to the land of days

BIRTH - FIRST HUMAN SOUNDS - FIRST BREATH

His mother gasps brave against the pain There are beads of
perspiration on her lips At last the child bursts forth in a
gush of blood He draws his first breath His cries are mixed
with hers

BABYS POVS MOTHERS SMILE HANDS ETC

His mothers smile the first thing he perceives It covers
him with light She is goodness peace the fountain of life
hers is the very breath of paradise Wordlessly she speaks
with his soul He cannot tell where she leaves off and he
begins Fromthe beginning she ignores her interests and
convenience to serve his

But who is this -- his father Their relation is not as
clear Mr OBrien looks at his wife as the child is passed
into his arms Tears of joy sting his eyes What have we
done he seems to ask

The child has awakened from out of nothing risen from the
uncomprehending dust Why now Not earlier or a thousand
years hence

He looks with a heart of trust No care assaults him that his
mother cannot answer no pain no troubling need Her touch
puts fear to flight A perfect love surrounds him Father and
mother speak as one He lives in a world free of
contradiction

Colors shapes curious sounds at first nothing coheres
Then little by little things assume sense Letter by
letter he spells them out What new dream is this

She looks at him in wonder His ear like a sea-shell fresh
from the surf his hands and arms and mouth trembling from
time to time as though in fear

O that world that death knew not

He grasps his mothers finger Her hands cup his feet The
world is bound by her smile The sun is a toy

INT OBRIEN BEDROOM - INFANCY - MUSIC 2B

She looks at him in his crib He shouts with delight
Everything runs tog¢gther a blur a dream He holds his hand
close to his face The lights on the tree in the living room
shine red green and blue His father plays the piano

She leans down OVer him All blessing nourishment beauty
proceed from her The promise of deep joy

Outside the oak tree throbs with cicadas A sprinkler ticks
back and forth

FLOWERS ANIMALS BOYS - FORCED PERSPECTIVE SET

Everything is bigger and more animated later it will appear
Things speak with him directly A dragonfly looks at him
then darts on At night the curious moon peers in through his
window Mother come Where am I now

JACK
Momma

A ball rolls ahead of him He cannot close his hands around
it He reaches ina bucket of minnows The little fish sing
as they run from his hand

His mother watches as he takes his first steps She feels a
pinprick in her chest a pinch to see his first attempt at
independence freedom detachment

He chases the sky Hé wraps himself in skirts of light He
laughs with delight as she catches him up into her arms

The table walks the faucet sings His happiness in infinite

But in a picture from the story book -- the crocodile pulls
on the elephant by his nose Why Why does he do that

HIS FATHER — MUSIC
He touches his fathers beard

FATHER
Sandpaper

His father takes a coin out of his ear How

He sits him on his knee and play Horse Brrumpphh Up and
down they go He shrieks with delight

The neighbors have come by Mr Bigden makes big faces The
grown-ups are heroes and giants in the earth

FATHER (CONTD)
we had the Commander over for
dinner -- SiS Little devil bit him
on the ankie

INT HALL — MUSIC

He wants to go down the dark hall but he is afraid to by
himself He turns to his mother She understands comes
forward to take his hand Overhead the ceiling opens as the
attic fan clicks on

EXT FRONT PORCH OTHER INFANT POVS

He picks the neighbors tulips and brings them to her in a
wagon

MOTHER

Oh sweetheart They belong to our
neighbors But youre very sweet to
bring them to your mother Yes you
are

She does not frown or scold him She kisses the bottoms of
his feet She bends over and blows on his tummy to make him
laugh She slips him into his PJs Lying near her heart
hearing its faint thud he knows peace

Their attunement grows They are wrapped together like two
vines One in soul Still

He throws his bottle on the floor Patiently she fetches it
again She sets two colored balls in front of him He touches
them and they roll away as though with a life of their own

Clouds grass sun water flower the world is a rebus
Wordlessly it speaks with him --

INT CRIB - NEW CHILD - WINDOW

A crib stands in front of a bright window A new child lies
in it his brother RL

How friendly the universe looks to his mother now A gift
from the light How kind the divinity who favored her this
way

She is born at the same time as her children She learns from
their laughter She grows up with them

She whispers a blessing

Jack looks at his new brother At first he does not share his
mothers pleasure When will it do something Will it go back
to the hospital

iS

JACK
Baby night night

He hears the babys shouts of joy its squeals and warbles of
delight Now he must share her love She holds it instead

TIGHT ON BOOK OF ANIMALS

Lion tiger dog bird he names the creatures She shows
them to him in a book and he names them one by one

Baby blocks Letters shaped into new combinations The world
assumes a sense moves towards a design

EXT FRONT YARD - MOVING OUTDOORS FOR THE FIRST TIME
Mother and father plant a sweetgum tree to mark the new

babys birth They take his picture next to it The trees
growth will serve as a measure of the childrens own
24

Far away a bell rings He rushes out to look for the ice
cream truck His grandmother calls him away from the street
She looks for him she cannot find him He understands that
he can hide from her The tension is too great

JACK
Heres me

We move in widening circles farther and farther away from
his first familiar world

UNDERWATER SHOT (SWIMMING POOL)

Weightless he bounces through the shallow end of a swimming
pool his feet pushing off the bottom

MOTHER
Hold your nose Not otf in the
deep

INT PARENTS BEDROOM

He sneaks into his parents bedroom In a chest of drawers
he discovers his fathers campaign ribbons a commendation
from the admiral scapulars from the Sisters of St Anne
Chinese money in fantastic denominations He marvels at the
mystery of their separate lives

‘Suddenly he hears a noise He turns to discover his mother
in the doorway

MOTHER
Ther where we Keep our things
sweetheart Leave those alone All
right

He nods She overlooks his faults his fits of willfulness
and temper The music bathes all things in love

EXT FIRST SNOW

He reaches out to feel his first snow She stands behind him
smiles

‘ANOTHER DAY - STEVE
He turns around at the sound of a babys cry

JACK
Wheres his momma

MOTHER
Hes your new brother

JACK
How many of them will there be

On closer examination he finds the child fascinating He
touches it strokes its skin

EXT THE CHOW DOG - DUSK

He fears a dog that lives down the street with Howard and
Rusty Wells two neighbors the boys own age a chow with a
purple tongue and a curling tail There is a menace in its
eyes The instant it appears panic enters his blood His
mother feels him clutch her hand more tightly as though he
understood that he were small and vulnerable She gives him a
look to say I will protect you

INT OBRIEN HOUSE - THE NEW BABYS CRI®

Jack wants to stroke the new baby then to pour a glass of
water on him A glance from his mother restrains him

EXT THE STICKLEYS - A PROPERTY LINE

Next door across a vacant lot teeming with snakes and
lizards stands a dilapidated house No one has ever seen the
owners come in or go out

FATHER
Stay away Dont bother them
Thats the Stickleys property
Starting at this line

He looks at the Ground but where the vacant lot leaves off
and the Stickleys’ yard begins he cannot tell and does not
care

JACKS POVS

His parents guard him carefully from the sight of anything
which might disturb him One day when he sees a man rolling
wildly on the ground his mother puts her hands over his
eyes Sweeping him up into her arms she carries him away

He looks at her with a frown What was in that man

Bath time Fear is forgotten The boys make no effort to
cover their nakedness

Everything is pure and without blemish All quarrels are
hidden from his eyes all sickness suffering and death He
knows what Adam did

CUT MERTHIOLATE SPINNING ON THE GRASS SPINNING FAN

He hears his mother singing in the kitchen

She catches him by the hands and’ spins him round and round
until he is so dizzy he can no longer stand up but stumbles
around drunkenly until he sinks down in the grass

The whirling fan Water from the hose He loves all that
flows

The 4th of July a sparkler makes figures in the night
Laughter is the dominant tone of this section Knowledge is
delight Sorrow is a passing thing Ali glows from deep
within

He falls and cuts his knee It hurts when she puts on the
drops but then she blows the pain away

MOTHER
All right now

He laughs With the touch of her hand she restores him to
peace

SOAP BUBBLES

He blows soap bubbles into the air wondrous iridescent
They drift off and are gone Delight does not last

Gradually the subHWe radiance passes from things as though
a layer of cloud had Come over the sun Slowly as the dawn
the boy is growing up Music helps to indicate this change

Something violent and unfamiliar disturbs him when he sees
his mother paying too much attention to his little brother

Gradually the world enters his life Little by little he
will come to set great store by things he never dreamt of
before
He snatches a toy away from RL

JACK
Mine

JACKS POVS

RL sees a cat

RL
Is he scared of kids What does he
do to kids Does he lick kids

LAMP

Jack knocks over a lamp It falls to the floor and breaks
His mother enters the room

MOTHER
Did you do this Were you boys
horsing around

(Jack nods)
You always tell the truth Youre a
good boy Be more careful next
time

CRAYON DRAWING

She compliments RL on a drawing he has done Jack puts his
own aside Already RL is the better artist

JACK
Who do you love most
MOTHER
I love you ail the same
JACK
All three
(she nods)

Can I tell you something he did

MOTHER
“Would he mind your telling me

So fine a scruple had not occurred to him He learns from her
the subtle ways of honor truth

The supreme joy that life can offer is to see her pleased as
when one does well in school or tells the truth

EXT OBRIEN HOUSE (FRONT YARD)

When some of the neighborhood kids push RL into a puddle
Jack rushes at them with a stick and puts them to flight

JACK
Clear out

He flings rocks at the retreating figures RL looks at him
gratefully As they go back to the house he puts his arm
around his big brothers waist Music enters

EXT OBRIEN HOUSE (BACKYARD) - MUSIC - DUSK

The family is sitting out on the back terrace Chicken is
cooking in the smoker She takes RL up into her arms and
points toward the horizon The sun has just set the sky is a
furnace of light

MOTHER
Thats where God lives

THE OTHER WORLD — MUSIC

The world is not yet something completely known and real It
continues to seem as though some nook or passageway might
give them access to another land One might pry up a
floorboard or at the back of the closet discover some
unsuspected room

That other world where does it lie Inside the walls in the
crawl space underneath the house who might live there He
gets down on his knees and looks through a vent He peers
into a far corner of the attic

Within his world it seems there is another world a nest of
worlds

INT BOYS ROOM - NIGHT

Night has fallen Mrs OBrien sits by the babys crib and
sings a lullaby

MOTHER
Bye baby bunting Daddys gone a-
hunting tp get a little rabbit
skine-

She kisses RL goodnight- She shuts out the light The fan
turns back and forthIn their young hearts she is the name
for God

JACK
Leave it on

The tiny nightlight watches over their sleep burning evenly
through the long hours until morning

In the moonlight the bushes assume a tropical size the
leaves are painted silver You would think the moon had
chosen where to shine

Mrs OBrien comes back to give RL an aspirin crushed in a
spoonful of molasses

RL
Whats that noise
MOTHER
Nothing
RL

Can you push the chest of drawers
against the wall

There is a narrow crack between them What might slide in
through it Jack feels lean and alone in the vast palace of
the night

MOTHER
Now sleep -- like good boys

The shadows dance on the ceiling rt is though they were
alive Strange faces peer out at them from the darkness
Nothing stands still Things come and go ebb and flow

STEVE (0S)
Why does the moon follow me

No sooner has she left the room than the boys are up and
about They bounce on their beds They inspect the glowing
tubes in the back of the radio They take voyages under the
sheets and blankets They hold a flashlight underneath their
Eaces

NEW ANGLE

When their mother comés in later she at first cannot locate
them One child it under his bed another sleeping on the
floor She lifts hem up and puts them back in their places
kisses them and closes the door

Light shines through the keyhole His infancy has passed
away as though in a single day His innocence is ended

INT BOYS ROOM - FIVE YEARS LATER 2C

Jack wakes up All is as it was before Where was he The
sweetgum tree that was planted at his brothers birth marks
the passage of five years

His eyes until now have been shielded from the sight of evil
suffering and death his family united with no hint of
contradiction between his mother and father

The world coheres Things assume their conventional names and
take their customary places We settle into the main epoch of
the story

Jack is now 11 years old in 6th grade his brothers 9 and 6
RL is a gentle boy loved by all quiet and generous with a
good sense of humor Steve is combative wild but brave and
loyal too A title card reads TEXAS 1956

Where before we kept entirely to the familys house we now
shall venture farther and farther into the neighborhood and
eventually out into the town in central Texas where they
live far from the world at large

The neighbors yards are shaded by oak trees and surrounded
by low hedges that the children have cut gaps through The
OBrien house stands with five or six others on the last
street in a subdivision Its front is turned towards the
other houses Behind it lie the open ww00ds rolling hills of
juniper broken here and there by Gow pastures

EXT NEIGHBORS LAWNS - SIMPLER TIMES

Now that the heat of the afternoon is past the neighbors lay
their hoses out The sprinklers start up with a cough
Standing with their sleeves rolled up the men regard them
gravely each adjusting his faucet until the water falls
precisely to the lawns perimeter

Rapt as a bird Jack watches the sprinklers spin round and
round until he hears his mother calling him home

INT OBRIEN HOUSE

She is preparing dinner She notices that the children have
grown steadily more quiet and watchful

MOTHER
Did you sweepthe patio honey Did
5 you geryour room

The boys go quickly about their chores They sweep up the
patio and wet it down with a hose to make it look fresh They
pull up a few handfuls of-crab grass and leave them in a
conspicuous place Then in the distance they see a green
Studebaker approaching

NEW ANGLE

The tires hiss on the concrete The boys are still and
expectant A moment later their father steps through the
front door

FATHER
Hi sweetheart Boys

He kisses their mother and turns to face them They do not
know quite how to act with him He catches them up into his
arms - physically shows them every sign of affection -- but
they are wary of him and hold themselves apart They
understand that he is devoted to them He would never abandon -

them no but always protect them Still they do not trust
him

He pours himself a shot of rye passes the glass back and
forth under his nose then tosses it down As soon as his
back is turned the boys slip away

FATHER (CONTD)
Wait a minute

EXT OBRIEN HOUSE —- LAWN

He shows Jack a patch of their lawn tnat 18 overrun with crab
grass and burrs

FATHER
Did you pick the weeds along the
side of the house Or only where I
could see

(Jack shakes his
head)

Theyre back again You need to
pull them up by the roots You
cant just yank off the tops

He shows Jack what he means To the child it seems the weeds
must run off to th nd of the earth a labor beyond his
strength

INT DINING ROOM

The boys look at each other from underneath their eyes as
their father says grace

FATHER
Lord bless this house and all
those who live within it Bless
this food to our use and us to thy
loving and faithful service and
make us ever mindful of the needs
of others Amen

Dinner is a nervous time often a little hell A symphony is
playing on the record player From time to time Mr OBrien
leaps up from the table to conduct a 2 passage that has
inspired him

STEVE

Am I dreaming
JACK

Pass the butter please
FATHER

Pass the butter please Sir
JACK

Sir
FATHER

So what did you do today
JACK

Went to school
FATHER

After that
JACK

Nothing
FATHER

Did you practice your piano
Jack studies the beads of moisture on his aluminum glass

FATHER (CONTD)
What about the yard

JACK
I picked where you told me to
FATHER
Did you Put in more runners
JACK
Uh huh
FATHER
Yes Sir It didnt look like it
Well see

The boys regard him warily His sharp sarcastic words and
orders so irrational he hardly expects that they will be
obeyed

He never asks what they did at school He does not know the
names of their friends Were he to inquire they’ would
suspect it was a trap

The boys bolt down their food A shadow passes over Jacks
eyes as RL is taken to task His mother sees this and reaches
out to caress his hair The little knot of anger melts away

FATHER (CONTD)
You like that blouse on your
mother

RL
Yes sir

FATHER
I got it for her in Saltillo The
same blouse here would cost 40

RL
Nice

FATHER

(to Mrs OBrien)
I got an urgent message from
Tampico Theres a fellow down
there who wants to consult with me
He wants to take me fishing on his
yacht and get my advice I told him
I was too busy

MOTHER
Mr Reese liked Jacks book report
and said he wanted him to build a
model He offered to come over and
hel

The music has distracted Mr oBrien He leaps from his chair
and turns up the volume

FATHER
Whats hat playing sweetheart It
starts with a B

She shakes her head His wild energy sweeps all things before
it he seldom waits for an answer

FATHER (CONTD)
Whats my favorite food

MOTHER
Lamb Fresh peas

FATHER
No no Keep on

MOTHER
Rice

FATHER
Right Okay start from there B-R-

She offers no guess He frowns Is she defying him

FATHER (CONTD)
Brahms Brahms

He conducts the music with passionate gestures He points to
the photographs of Toscanini on the record jacket Sometimes
he acts so like a child that the children themselves are
embarrassed

Seeing the look of cold anger in Jacks eyes he comes over
and kisses him He knows the boys do not like being kissed
He does it anyway partly they suspect for that very
reason

FATHER (CONTD)
He wrote this in 1883 Everyone
told him he was finished that he
would never write a decent piece of
music again so he worked hard and
4 went off in a park -- and sat under
a tree And he saw a deer running
under the trees and it gave him
the idea

The boys eye each other Everyone knows that he is lying
Doesnt he care

SATHER (CONTD)

INT KITCHEN

After dinner the children scrape their plates and leave them
in the sink to soak They waste no time getting out of the
house They run afraid that he might call them back

EXT NEIGHBORHOOD

The boys clasp each other by the wrists and spin each other
round and round until they are so dizzy that their knees
buckle and they fall down in the grass

RL
Another thing you can do -- press
down on the top of your head this
way -- then you grow

They practice heroic diving catches

STEVE
Tie me to a tree Nobody help
(once this is
done)
Help Help

Eventually RL comes back and unties him

RL squeezes the trunk of the tree He feels it rock back and
forth in his arms -- knows the savage life beneath its bark

They string words together to make Q magic formula that can
cause them to vanish into thin ain

RL
Caleecha Makeecha
LATER

Fireflies appear beneath the branches Frogs flop in the
cold drowned grass The boys wrest the iron lid off the
water meter Beneath it a toad sits still as a stone

Against the darkening sky somewhere beyond the horizon they
begin to make out the red lights of a radio tower

Jack and RL go looking for the Bates boys Steve calls out to
them to wait up He wants to come along too Jack shakes his
head He will only slow them down

JACK
Go back and wait on the porch
Count to Fifty then you come

RL
Let him Come

Jack considers the request Maybe they could lure him into a
trap or push him off the roof Steve will do anything they
ask of him

STEVE
Am I dreaming

JACK
Come on

GAMES

The splash a big rock makes when it plunges into the water
The pleasure of destroying an ant mound The burn of a rope
racing through your hands

They play Annie Annie Over with Harry and Joe Bates Cayler
the kid from Oak Ridge Lane drifts over Others follow

HARRY
Youre skinny

CAYLER
So what

HARRY

People say Im short

They mount their bicycles and skid on the slick parts of the
street Traffic is episodic in this part of town

Howard Wells appears a gaunt child who lives in the last
house on the block where the road turns to gravel

They smoke a vine

They cut across lawns and through flower beds Fences mean
nothing to them they make no distinctions of property They
play without permission wherever they choose

THE STICKLEYS HOUSE - DUSK

They Look through Q Ga late at the Stickleys house Even after
dark no light burns pifhin it The boys suspect the occupants
must be very peculiar or have something to hide

HOWARD
They were here before anybody else
moved in Nobodys ever seen ‘em

JACK
They wouldnt mind a visitor
Howard

CAYLER

Maybe you should drop in

RL
Theyve been waiting for you

Howard yelps as they push him towards the gate They laugh
and run away

KIDS
Not It Not It

They know the other world in their play It calls to them
summons them It seems to want them to find it

They run through the sprinklers to feel the water splash up
under their chins

They throw a baseball back and forth over the roof until they
can barely see it against the darkening sky

They play Kick-the-Can They are out where the pavement ends
and the new houses are going up when hey begin to hear
their mothers voices

MRS BATES (0s)
Harry Joe

The other children drift away first the Bates boys then
Cayler Finally only Howard Wells is left

MOTHER (0S)
RL Stevie

Her lovely voice floats on the evening air

JACK
Weve got to go Howard

HOWARD
We Cag still play on the porch

He seems reluctant to leav- He hangs around as though he
had nowhere elg to play-

RL
Your mom doesnt care what time you
get home Youre lucky

Howard shrugs Maybe so

JACK
Weve got to go

Howard gives them a blank haunted look Then without saying
a word he turns and heads home

The boys can barely make their mothers figure out where she
stands by the porch light in the gathering darkness How
pleasant to defy her -- to pretend you have not heard -- to
dissolve into the night where even the dogs are blind

MOTHER (0S)
Come in

They race around in the dark making noises The wind rushes
past them It still wants to play

STEVE
Scorpions Scorpion dance

They dance around to keep the scorpions who come up onto the
warm patio at dusk from stinging them -- leaping about like
dervishes spinning shrieking with laughter and fear To be
dissolved into something greater to know a more this is
happiness

MOTHER
Come in right now you little
potlickers

A boy named Robert watches from the distance
INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

They slip quietly toward their bedroom hoping to avoid their
father who sits by-a gooseneck lamp reading the paper

FATHER
Son Come here Reach me my
lighter

He could as easily reach it himself It seems he wants to
harass the child o demonstrate his authority Jack glances
at his mother who looks at the ground as soon as she meets
his eyes

JACK
Cant you reach it

His father does not answer Jack goes over picks up the
lighter gives it to him and starts off toward the bedroom

FATHER
Havent you forgotten something

He points to his cheek The child comes over and gives him a
kiss goodnight

FATHER (CONTD)
Is that all I get

Jack kisses him again coldly and gives him a hug

FATHER (CONTD)
You love your father

JACK
Yes sir

FATHER
Good

-INT BOYS ROOM

Jack says goodnight to the rocks in his rock collection He
whispers their names apatite chalcedony azurite obsidian

RL (08

JACKS POV ON HIS FATHER - NIGHT

Mr OBrien has gone into the living room to play the piano
Jack watches him through a crack in the door

Their father is an accomplished musician Their home is never
more friendly and at peace than when he sits at the piano
playing Bach or Chopin

INT BOYS ROOM - DAY

Day streams through the windows The sparrows fuss underneath
the eaves

MOTHER
‘The laziest boys Ive ever seen

She reaches under the covers and tickles their feet When
this does not work she comes back with a tray of ice cubes
wrapped in a dish towel and lays it against their backs

RL
No fair

Jack looks outside The Studebaker is gone There is laughter
in the kitchen

JACK
Stevie

They cail to their little brother When he comes running down
the hall they jerk a rope they have concealed in a seam of
the carpet and he goes sprawling

He is silent for a moment then gets up quickly laughing
Shep races around in mad excitement

MOTHER
Hurry or youll be late

RL
Mom Every night do you grow Mom ——
suppose somebody steals our
clothes

MOTHER
Then youll just have to run home
bare-naked

She pats him on the cheek He is the gentlest of the boys
When he was an infant he only wanted p sith on her lap Jack
suspects that he might be her favorite

EXT WACO STREET

Jack and RL run to school
EXT SCHOOL

They part reluctantly as the first bell rings No school
friend can take a brothers place

INT FIFTH-GRADE CLASSROOM

Jacks teacher Mr Reese is a dapper man with a high voice
and a Clark Gable moustache Jack glances around nervously
He has trouble keeping his mind on the lessons trouble too
getting along with the other children He does not know why

There is a prety Freckled girl whom he would particularly
like to make a go ‘impression on Her name is Marsha She is
graceful with long brown hair Her smile leaves him
pleasantly confused

He listens in rapture as Marsha stands in front of the whole
class and sings Once I Had a Secret Love

BOY Shes nice and stuff I put a roach
in her desk

When he comes upon her alone in the hall -- the opportunity
he has been waiting for -- his heart comes to his throat and
he walks past her without saying a word
4l

EXT DOWNTOWN STREET - LAME MAN

One afternoon with his mother Jack sees a lame man hobbling
along the sidewalk

He watches in pity and horror as the man limps away That
shape could be his Nothing that he knows or possesses could
defend him It might happen at any moment Without rhyme or
reason It might be right around the corner or come up from
behind

He turns to his mother

JACK a
“Is this a rare thing Can it happen
to anyone

She looks at him nods A trouble comes into his mind He
does not know the cause

She can make hurt and fear go away But sickness What if one
of them got sick What if she herself did

He remembers a man in the barber shop with one shoe bigger
than the other What did it hide that big shoe

INT LIVING ROOM GRANDMOTHER

Some days afterwards his grandmother is visiting Her bright
spirits do not distract him from noticing her arthritic
hands the veins in her arms her bunioned feet projecting

off the end of the ttoman Again he feels a strange pity
that is mixed with QO Certain horror too Is this his fate
His mothers why does M0 one speak of what haunts him He
cannot believe dhat he ight die or ever lie in the grave
No death does not apply to him His mother reassures him

MOTHER
We all get old Its nothing to be
frightened of

JACK
Like that Will you
(she nods)
Will I

MOTHER
Everyone Look at Shep

He remembers Austin the skinny boy who could not stop
pacing He remembers a woman shouting at her boyfriend on a
downtown street and a crazy woman who called him over to see
a baby carriage with a doll stretched out in it

It seems there are things he can no longer escape with a leap
into her lap The world is a burning house

And still her smile quickly cheers him He forgets what he
saw

GRANDMOTHER
You let these kids run wild
MOTHER
Theyre so curious Mom -- so

anxious to learn I spend most of
my time trying to stop fights
between them What a ful
Theyre like wild horses

GRANDMOTHER
No discipline Theres the biggest
change in those boys when their dad
comes home Little devils
(to Steve)
I know you

EXT NEIGHBORHOOD — DDT TRUCK

STEVE
The DDT truck

Already other kids are running behind the truck which
‘periodically passes through the neighborhood to spray for
mosquitoes Jack and RL laugh and shout and wave their arms
running joyfully -in and out of the cloud of insecticide The
driver laughs and Waves as though he were driving an ice-
cream truck Howard doeS t look at’ Jack when he asks

HOWARD
You want to spend the night at my
house

EXT WELLS HOUSE - DUSK

Howard leads Jack towards his house In the fading light it
appears oddly solitary No light shines from within

INT WELLS HOUSE

Jack had looked forward to coming here But his heart sinks
as he enters the house for the first time The heavy drapes
are drawn tight shut One breathes an atmosphere of sorrow
an air of insufferable gloom The mere contemplation of the
dark Spanish furniture the mounted antelope heads and limp
dusty magazines unnerves him

There are stacks of old papers here and there Cardboard
boxes stand in the corner yet unpacked The living room is
like an attic the lights are dim and the lampshades yellow
with age There are withered roses in a vase-No life here
only a memory of life

Howard is shy enough when they are playing but now he seems
especially silent and afraid He looks around anxiously for
some game to play

Mrs Wells knocks things over in the kitchen’ weaving as she
prepares their dinner She wears a bathrobe Jack does not
get a clear look at her

HOWARD
She said we could do any Win we
want

They walk on a table They drink pop and play with knives
Howard even throws a knife into the back of a door

JACK
Wheres your dad Howard

Howard makes a gesture as though to say He just took off
Went Jack sees that Mrs Wells is in her bedclothes though
it is not time for bed He turns to Howard who looks away
He gazes at Mrs Wells with astonishment and dread He is
careful to spare Howards feelings and smiles awkwardly

A few minutes later he asks Howard if he can use the phone
Howard nods Jack calls his mother He takes care to speak
softly Howard iS standing nearby but with an exquisite
consideration he turns away

JACK (CONTD)
Mother Can I come home

MOTHER (0S)
Whats the matter hon

JACK
Nothing I can walk

Howard does not seem surprised He makes no protest
Jack shakes his hand in an awkward effort to reassure him of

his friendship Rusty peers out of his room at the older
boys He has been quiet the whole time
44

EXT WELLS HOUSE - DUSK

Jack goes home dragging his blanket behind him The Wells
chow dog watches but does not chase him The unhappy house
looms in the background as the whistle of a distant train
pierces the stillness

INT OBRIEN HOUSE - NIGHT
Jack throws himself into his mothers arms
JACK

Theres nothing like that is

there
She frowns He cannot tell her what is disturbing him Things
no longer speak with one voice He has descended into the
world of duality
INT BOYS ROOM
That night his mother says a prayer by their beds a rare

occurrence While she hears their prayers she does not often
join in them They glance at each other

JACK
Mother which one of us do you love
most
MOTHER
I love you all three the same
JACK
But - we dont care -- who most

She laughs and kissS RLs feet

JACK (CONTD)
How can you do that Its

disgusting

MOTHER
Well Im sorry His feet were
cold

JACK

Yeah but you dont kiss them
RL teases his brother with a glance
She reads the story of Peter Rabbit to the younger boys She

has done so a hundred times before It is the only story they
ask to hear
Now only Jack

MOTHER
But dont go into Mr
MacGregors garden Your father had
an accident there he was put ina
pie by Mrs MacGregor

is still awake

MOTHER (CONTD)
Whats you favorite part of school

JACK
Lunch

She looks at RL who lies nearby

She laughs At the same time it troubles her to see the

MOTHER
You love your little brother dont
you

JACK
Uh huh I dont know how far hell

MOTHER
What do you mean

JACK
When were out in the woods he
just likes to gawk at the fish And
sometimes --

MOTHER
What

JACK

- he doesnt stick up’ for himself
or hit back Whats going to happen
to him

(she smiles)
You can talk him out of his money
or whatever he has in his pocket
He kept a dead minnow in his
wallet Just thinking about it
makes me want to throw up Im not
kidding

first signs of self in him She knows the way this road must

Lead

Whether it be his grandmother or Mrs Wells in her draped
rooms or the lame man downtown Jack quickly forgets every
disturbance in the mystery that comes punctually at the end
of the day when the world melts away and he enters the land
of forgetting

INT DINING ROOM - WITH IDEALIZED-IMAGES OF OTHER HOMES

Mr OBrien clinks a glass with his spoon to get their
attention

FATHER

Lord bless this house May there
be peace within its walls May all
who live here be true to each
other And please be good ) Ed my
brother Hes been 00d 4o hun dreds
of people Amen

(after a pause)
Take your elbows off the table

JACK
I was going to

FATHER
You defy me

JACK
Whats that

FATHER

You Know

One does not feel his Qnaer is caused by this trifle of
putting ones lbpwS on ne table but that it was there to
begin with It doe not last long A moment later he might be
showing them affection Kissing them Pinching their butts
They do not like it but he does not seem to care

FATHER (CONTD)
Its how I was raised

He has a taste for hot peppers The imprint of his kisses
burns their cheeks

FATHER (CONTD)
Why are you whimpering

STEVE
I felt a scorpion crawl up my back

FATHER
Nonsense

STEVE
It happened the other night I
squeezed him till he was dead

The older boys laugh

FATHER
You may leave the table

He turns to Jack

FATHER (CONTD)

Will you continue to defy me I

need to know Either you take me

into your confidence aS a son

should his father or -wait

youre interrupting’ me- Im not

done yet Do you think I can

finish Thank you your mMésty

Jack grinds his teeth

FATHER (CONTD)
You could do these simple things if
you really wanted to Say Sir
Not slam the screen door Ill give
you one more chance Are you a good
boy Then do as I ask Obey your
father

He rules the world from his chair at the head of the table
His opinion is correct He can tell others how to order their

lives what they should do Every other opinion is willful
mad

INT HALL

Later Jack overhears his mother and father whispering in the
living room

MOTHER (0S)

You havent filed an income tax
return for the last three years
gambled our savings awaycards

FATHER (0S)

With you have an equal chance
Besides Ive denied myself I have
the right to a few pleasures

Jack approaches the door to the living room slightly ajar

MOTHER (0S)
Youre never home I dont know
whether its good or bad

FATHER (0S)
throw it back in my face

MOTHER (0S)
We loved each other I thought it
would last forever I wanted to die
in your arms You remember how
happy we were You remember --
Jack does not stir He knew somethi was amiss He never
suspected it might be anything so dock and unfathomable

MOTHER (QO§) (ONTD)
I thought I could make you ljove me
but I see you cant do that T
dont know what makes somebody love
you but its not something you do
You dont get it by being kind or
generous or anything like that --

“Bugs dive into the screens and bounce off with a thrum The
fight leaps and lurches about As Jack approaches the door
their words gradually become more coherent until at last we
cut to them inside the living room

MOTHER (CONTD)
They get anxious when they know
you on your way home They jump
around You discipline them too
much You expect them to act like
adults You xpect things of them
they cant possibly achieve

FATHER
They learn respect

MOTHER
Thats not how to get them to
respect you Cant you see theyre
afraid of you -- their own father

FATHER
You dont back me up They have ten
times what we ever did

MOTHER
Youre never happy with anything
they do

MOTHER (CONTD)
Theres always something wrong with
it Even your own mother told you
sol

FATHER
Leave her out of this

Jack sees RL is awake sits down beside him and hugs him
close RL studies acompass The needle moves without being
touched
MOTHER (0S)
We cant keep on like this Were
driving each other crazy Why do
you act like such a tyraul

She suffers from his injustice toward the children from his
dark inexplicable rages She feels herSelf everything
being annihilated by him She has lost her freedom

FATHER (0S)
You want to see what a tyrant is
like

‘He cannot break free of her She is the rock on which he
stands Yet she will not be one with him

He seems to come apart inside A lust for destruction fills
his blood Yet what does he have in life but her Nothing

RL
What is Mom crying about
JACK
Shes not crying
RL
Listen
JACK

Well she wont cry for long

RL
Why are they that way

INT LIVING ROOM

The next day the boys are very solicitous of their mother
They fix her a sandwich and bring her a cup of tea

She keeps her pain to herself Whom can she confide in
Neighbors talk and she would alarm those whom she loves She
is lonely far from her own people In shorthand for
discretions sake she jots down her thoughts

EXT OBRIEN HOUSE - CLOTHESLINE
Jack watches her set the laundry out to dry

MOTHER
What are you thinking hon

JACK
Nothing

She begins to chase him a girl again He runs around the
house breathless with delight Then all at once he does

not hear her When he goes back to look for her she jumps
out of the shadows He does not lau

JACK (CONT’D)
Dont fight with Dad

She looks away embarrassed How much doeg he know His heart
aches for her constantly She feels him back of her waiting
on her bearing what part of the burden he can

EXT OBRIEN HOUSE - LAWN

Mr OBrien inspects the lawn

FATHER
Get clear to the edge

JACK
Theres so much All crab grass I
cant ZL wont

FATHER
Are you sure

Jack looks away backing down He hates himself for it
Later he watches hig father strop a straight razor

EXT BRAZOS RIVER

His father is teaching him how to swim mocking his fears
calling him farther out into the deep His feet are barely
able to touch the muddy rocks at the bottom

There is no one on the shore No one to see

FATHER
Come out Farther

Why Jack gasps for air Would his father -- Why so far
Sil

FATHER (CONTD)
Swim

A POV looking up from the depths What lies below

JACK
Was that a water moccasin

FATHER
Did you see the head and thats
all Thats a turtle

Later dressing together he looks at his fathers powerful
body He is weak and slight while his ffather is strong

EXT OBRIEN HOUSE — LAWN - DUSK

He picks crab grass at the edge of the yard Tears come to
his eyes The gak tree looks down as though in sympathy

INT LIVING ROOM - DUSK

He almost has made his way through the living room when his
father puts down the newspaper

FATHER
Did you get it all

Jack nods He deceives his father This way is better though
it hurts his sense of honor He still tells his mother the
truth

JACK
I lie é (apar ct)

MOTHER
Dont I ve told lies myself Ive
tried it Its not the best way

INT KITCHEN — TIGHT ON HANDS

Jack has divided a cupcake his mother baked into two
portions Steve waits for his Turning to Jack she asks

MOTHER
Are they equal Give him the piece
you want
It is a revelation

She sends the boys out with raspberries with instructions to
leave them on Mrs Stickleys front step

INT BOYS ROOM - NIGHT

Tonight it is their father who comes to visit them before
they go to sleep He turns the gooseneck lamp towards the
wall and amuses them by making silhouettes on it with his
hands A duck A bear A dog He makes their faces up with a
burnt cork Steve gets to blow out the match Now discord
seems a dream Why cant it be this way every night -- in the
daytime too

FATHER
(to Jack)
I remember when you were born They
wouldnt let me come nome The Navy
said An officer must be present
at the laying of the Keel but not
at the launching

He gets up to leave

RL
Sit with us

He shakes his head and moves to the door

STEVE
Dont close it all the way

Jack listens as his father plays the piano His brothers are
asleep How ravishing the music sounds as it comes floating
down the hall How strange that there should be such
tenderness in a man otherwise so coarse so unreasonable
That one who professe§ to love you should cause you injury
and suffering yet appear not to care that he does

HIGH DOWN ANGLE- HELICOPTER SHOT - SCREECH OWL

The music flows out through the windows into the night The
camera rises over the neighborhood which lies in peace
beneath the stars

INT PARENTS’ BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

Mr and Mrs OBrien talk inlow voices They have turned on
the fan to assure the privacy of their conversation

MOTHER
You fight with the men above you --
you laugh at them -- then wonder

why they dont promote you’

FATHER
Its fools they put ahead of me
Liars They pass over me

MOTHER
And the men underneath you -- you
work them too hard

FATHER
Morale is great Sometimes they
work thirty-six hours at a stretch
-- dont even ask for overtime You
dont know what its like Always
following orders of men you cant
respect They want you fo Scheme
for their favor It makes you less
than a man

EXT KIMBALLS HOUSE

The next afternoon a large black grackle appears in the oak
tree and shortly afterward they discover Robert sitting on
the fence a mean child who it seems lives on a street far
away they are not quite sure where

Whos that

From a hiding place Robert shoots the Kimballs German
shepherd with a BB gun The poor creature normally so proud
and threatening looks about wondering where the blow is
coming from defer-o’ess against it now reduced to a
cringing whimpering mass Robert smiles

EXT STICKLEYS HOUSE
The Stickleys house is not up to the standard of the restof

the neighborhood The free-standing garage is unpainted its
windows opaque

ROBERT
Lets us bust ‘em
RG
Why
ROBERT

Why Just ‘cause

Jack mumbles some words about his mother having forbidden it

ROBERT (CONTD)
You afraid boy

(after a pause)
You dont need to tell her do you
Nobody needs to know but us
chickens I broke a window once
Didnt nothing happen to me
Chicken aint nothing but a bird

(later)
Why let them keep you from having
fun Why not do what you wanta do

Robert punches another boy on the arm The boy runs off
howling

JACK
Whyd you do that

ROBERT
Im not him What do I care

The strange boy fascinates Jack with his amused contempt for
others his nonchalance his sensitivity to anything which
wounds his pride his refusal to play a hypocritical part

Later they find themselves alone

ROBERT (CONTD)
Hold out your elbow

He is lucid calm and cynical There is an odd motiveless
malignity in him

ROBERT (CONTD)
Isaid hold it out

As though a hypnotist had commanded it Jack holds out his
elbow Robert raps it with the handle of a screwdriver Jack
pushes him away surprised Robert pushes him back Does he
really want to fight

Jack hesitates When someone hits you are you supposed to
hit him back How else prevent him from doing it again

‘trembling he turns and walks away
INT LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT EVENING
His mother is dressed up to go out She has come to tell them

goodnight She is very lovely but her black gloves and veil
make her seem unfamiliar to the boys

MOTHER
What is it

RL
Why are you wearing those

MOTHER
Were going out

RL
Take them off

She does Her hands are restored to their natural beauty

STEVE
Can I touch your earrings

She lets him The boys look dolefully at her
Y

JACK
Dont go We can fix you dinner

MOTHER
Well be back by twelve

INT OBRIEN HOUSE - JACKS POV

The Studebaker grows smaller in the distance Will there be a
time when they might be separated from her forever

They bounce on the beds and have a pillow fight Their uncle
is the babysitter He lets them do anything they please while
he talks on the phone in the other room

INT OBRIEN HOUSE LATER

Later that night Jack wakes up to a muffled noise of anger in
the living room He sits up in his bed Outside the trees
swash back and forth filling him with a sense of terror

He slips out of bed and peers through a crack in the door
into the living room

MOTHER (0S)
»We needed it We did

Mr OBrien rages up and down the hall He swings between
extremes of behavior one moment acting like a fool then
suddenly remembering that he is the father of a family

His high-minded struggle against his shortcomings never lasts
for long however He is of too impulsive a nature

‘

He simply cannot stand the idle life of a penitent in the
bosom of his own family and he always ends up rebelling
against it

Jack sees his brothers are awake He strokes their backs to
comfort them What has their father done What is he capable
of The screen door slams

Jack sees tears in his mothers eyes She looks up with a
start He takes her hand

MOTHER (CONTD)
I thought you were asleep

JACK
Why are you crying Mother sweet
Mother

MOTHER

I was thinking about your father
Missing him

JACK
I know youre crying now but
someday you wont Someday were
going to -- help you --
(how )
Can I get you something to drink

How is she to get close to her husband This is a slow
starvation She has almost resigned herself to loneliness and
isolation She is determined that the children should know
nothing of her troubles They are anxious enough as it is

Jack runs to his bedroom and gathers up his savings twenty
or thirty dollars in coins He gives them to her in a jar

She touches him on the cheek She avoids his eyes

He knows the misery of nights He sees her eyes dark and
pinched with torture she whom he loves more than life she
whom he would die to save from any hurt

JACK (CONTD)
Were all right We wont ever
leave you Mom

MOTHER
Thank you

JACK
We wont ever do anything to make
you unhappy I promise

Later hearing her voice in the other room it strikes him
that some day he might be left to himself in this world Ina
whisper he prays -

JACK (CONTD)
Help me not be mean Help me not to
sass my Dad —-

EXT OBRIEN HOUSE - LAWN
The next day Mr OBrien inspects Jacks yard-work

FATHER
Shake the dirt off the roots so it
doesnt leave a hole ThatS too
hard I guess And over here why
havent you watered fhe corners
You havent had time of course
Look this is cropped so close its
going to burn out Keep it watered
Whys this bare

JACK
The grass wont grow under the
trees

His soul is seared into a rage Nothing is enough

FATHER
Tt does at the Kimballs
JACK
They have a yardman
FATHER
(defensively)

They have money Kimball inherited
it ALL day Im at the office It
seems you can put in a few hours
out here You want me to go over it
again What are you smiling about
I know what youre thinking

JACK
You do

FATHER
I dont want you to say a word
until youre done Ill be very
disappointed if you do I wont
know about it Of course you could
fool me

He has the unshakable belief that he must approve or modify
everything the children do He is full of petty and
exasperating cautions Watch it Step there Open the door

EXT GARAGE - A CAT

The boys find a cat and take it up onto the roof of the
garage It writhes in their hands Its look of terror gives
them a faint thrill of pleasure

RL
We might hurt it --

JACK
They always land ontheir feet

Cayler nods He too is curious tg see how the cat will
react to the fall It yowls and lands with 4 thud shakes
itself and walks off slowly RL glances at Jack with a new
distrust

Jack looks away Where before it seemed all evil lay outside
now with a growing dread he sees that it might lie within
him too

He cheats to win yet he is angry when others cheat him

RL
(playing guns)
I got you
JACK

‘No you didnt I was just wounded

How can he object to the evil in others when he does those
very things which jn them he deplores

Robert watches from afar
INT BOYS ROOM

His mother answers him Most of her words play against scenes
of their everyday life

MOTHER
Treat everyone as youd like to be
treated Help each other Encourage
each other Love everyone Every
leaf Every ray of light You boys
are the pride of my life

MOTHER (CONTD)

The reason I’m saying all this is
that I dont want you to waste ten
years of your life learning to know
yourself and the reason for your
difficulties as your mother did
Its hard to stand by and see your
children make the same mistakes you
made I hope you wont sweetheart

Jack remembers holding a toy out to RL inviting him to take
it then snatching it away again teasing him expecting him
to cry astonished that he smiles instead

- MOTHER (CONTD)
Once I dreamed of becoming a

doctor
RL
Why didnt you
MOTHER
Things didnt work out
JACK
I dont get it
MOTHER
What dont you get
JACK
The whole thing
MOTHER
Well you have a lot to learn and

you can learn it all at once
FATHERS POV

Mr OBrien sees how the boys dote on their mother He waves
Jack and RL over to the car

INT MOVING CAR - WEALTHY NEIGHBORHOOD
They are out for a drive They pass a big house

JACK
Who lives there

FATHER
Frank Johnson He started out as a
barber but he built something big
Never let anything stop him

FATHER (CONTD)
Bucky who runs the company now he
started out on an ice truck He
even got fired a couple of times

Jack and RL have never seen any of these men but they are
mythical figures in the boys imagination

FATHER (CONTD)

Bucky asked me once if I wanted to
go deer hunting with him I said
no In front of all his top people
He asked me why I said I cant
stand to hunt it makes me sick
You shouldve seen the look on
their faces You know what Bucky
told me He was quiet fora minvte
then he said “You Know I’ve never
liked it that much ejher Maybe I
wont go this year

Jack looks away embarrassed The boys need no proof of their
fathers superiority

FATHER (CONTD)
A corporation has no soul Theyll
cut their own grandmothers throat
It has to be that way Merciless
But if you take their money you
have to take their --

INT RESTAURANT

Jack burns with embarrassment as Mr OBrien complains to a
waitress about their food then kisses her hand for serving
them well He makes a big show of giving her a tip holding
the money out hen pultin it away when she reaches for it
Oddly she does not Wind all this as much as Jack does but
laughs it off as play

INT MOVING CAR - LATER

JACK
why do you work so hard

FATHER
So youll have a place to stand I
might not amount to anything but
you will You boys will stand on my
shoulders
61 -

THEIR POVS - DOWNTOWN and POOR PARTS OF TOWN (BARTLETT ETC)

The city which at first seemed glorious to Jack is a
mystery to him now with its freight yards and grain
elevators its blind men cripples and drunks shouting from
the doorways
FATHER
The world lives by trickery If you

want to succeed you cant be too
good

They reach the poor parts of town His father has come to buy
some barbecue There are rundown shacks and cars parked in
front yards A black man stares at hip

FATHER (CONTD)
Belong to yourself thats the
whole thing in life Learn to
Master yourself Your will Your
will makes you free Set up your
will as a law over you

Later Jack sees a team of workers digging a ditch Worms lie
on the heaps of dirt cut in two by their shovels Jacks
heart is moved to pity at the sight of the writhing
creatures And then to see these men with their bodies bent
their hair disheveled their faces glistening with sweat
their hands and arms covered with clay

It seems that suffering must lie at the heart of life not at
its periphery it is not some accident that troubles the
unfortunate only No inconstancy is the rule The fading
rose The uprooted tree

FATHER (CONTD)
See those people Somebody got the
upper hand with them Dont let it
happen to you Youve got to get
ahead of the other guy Hell be
doing all he can to do the same to
you

Jack exchanges a look with his brother riding in the back
seat They observe everything about him which is ridiculous
then mimic and exaggerate these features for each other

FATHER (CONTD)
Money will break down all obstacles
in your way Hold on to it Its
the most reliable thing there is in
this world A friend is likely to
betray you Money never will

FATHER (CONTD)
Find the thing they cant do
without Patents

As his father goes on Jacks thoughts turn to their dog
Sheps is a perfect love He is their friend their clown
their guardian and protector He accepts being teased
slighted ignored He knows no unhappiness like the three-—
legged dog who lives down the block and runs around as though
no misfortune had ever befallen him

INT LIVING ROOM - JACKS POVS - LATER

Jack listens as his father questions his mother about a bent
spoon

FATHER

Who did this

(turning on RO
I might enjoy lazing around too I
could walk out the front door and
say I was going to pick
blackberries Just wave goodbye and
wander off No you want to be
served but you dont want to have
any responsibilities in return
Youre going to have a record and
its going to follow you around the
rest of your life On it will be
the grades you made -- what you
accomplished and what you didnt
People read it If you mess up you
might not be able to get a security
cle ie People will ask why

One knows he will awaken come to himself at last It will be
dreadful when he does Could he endure a full awakening
Would it destroy him

EXT OAK TREE

Outside Jack climbs the live oak tree Higher and higher he
goes until he stands like a sailor on top of a mast There

he may commune with himself The world below seems small and
unreal

The door bursts open His father storms outside and sits on
the porch A few moments later RL comes outside He sits
down beside his father and rests his head against his
shoulder

Jack watches He wonders if he could love his father too —-

EXT BATES HOUSE - SERIES OF ANGLES

The Bates live in harmony He never passes their house
without receiving a benediction Mr Bates plays football
with the boys and Mrs Bates serves them cookies at the end
of the afternoon Theirs is a happy home with nothing to
hide

MRS BATES
Are you sure your mother isnt
wondering where you are

JACK
No Maam -- shes ok

He sees how Mr Bates draws his sons close hugs them
tenderly strokes their hair

INT EPISCOPAL CHURCH

The next morning Mr OBrien sits at the organ in church He
seems calm and untroubled He loves the winding toccatas and
fugues the candles the stillness of the choir loft before
the service the music swelling out majestically as he
presses down the keys His will relaxes He ceases to fret
All is as it should be Why not always so

Why do people oppress each other Why are they not faithful
to the best in themselves

- The camera rises over the ranks of pipes over the gladiolas
and the stained giass windows Jack marvels at this father a
man who for all his faith and vitality suffers from a deep
disquiet as though not even being God-fearing and pious
could bring peace’ to his Soul

His fingers work the keys his feet walk up and down the
pedais Jack reads the music turns the pages pulls the
stops At such moments they are bound together in harmony

Later Jack walks in the church alone His footsteps are
loud in the silence A sparrow caught inside the building
flies through the rafters and beats its wings against a high
windows trying to find a way out

EXT CHURCH GROUNDS - BELL

Mr Singh the sexton is taking down the flag

RL He rings the bell when you die

Jack watches as his father talks with a vestryman Mr
OBrien shows a courtesy and a desire to please that the boys
do not often see in him In the end he bids the stranger an
obsequious goodbye

FATHER
A friend of mine He owns half the
real estate in town

Sunday is a day of rest and relaxation Other families may
drop by to visit unannounced The stores are closed as
people take their ease Yet Mr OBrien is restless tense
They are having dinner on the porch when he turns to RL

FATHER (CONTD)

Will you do something for me You
promise me that you’fi do it
without asking what it is Just
have the confidence that what your
father asks of you is right

(RL nods)
For the next half hour will you
not speak unless you have something
important to say

(turning to Steve)
And what did you do today my fine-
feathered friend

One by one each child is called upon to justify himself
Where does it come from this pleasure in humiliation This
indifference to their dignity and even to his own He
deceives others debases himself in order to impress them --
makes up stories facts the etymologies of words without a
trace of shame

FATHER (CONTD)
Sit on the front two inches of your
chair Its good for your posture
I read it in the paper

He holds up a rock before Jack’) s eyes a thunder egg from the
childrens collection a sort of polished agate

FATHER (CONTD)

You actually bought this from Mr
Ledbetter Dont explain Just nod
Yes or no

JACK
He gave it to me That ones my
favorite

FATHER
I dont know how long I can keep
paying for these rocks Were
living in a fancy neighborhood but
we cant afford this house If
Kimball next door knew what our
situation was he would laugh Of
course he got all his money from
his father-inlaw

RL
Be quiet Please

FATHER
What did you say

Mr OBrien takes a hot pepper and rubs it on the childs
lips Mrs OBrien rises to her feet Ln anger

FATHER (CONTD)
You will straighten up and fly
right

Jack has never seen his father possessed in quite this way
His brothers cries are unbearable The innocent one has no
defense

JACK
Leave him alone

His father looks up astonished Jack strikes him with his
fist steps back and stares at him defiantly His father
slaps him across the face

MOTHER
Stoe

FATHER
Keep your voice down The neighbors
can hear Children arent
reasonable They can only be
governed by fear

MOTHER
How can you be so cruel

FATHER
I give my life for them My blood
I let them eat my heart Do I tie
them to a tree Do I take off my
belt -- like McKeever They have
their lives from me

He will force them to love him whether they like it or not

RL is put in a closet Mrs OBriens blood rises in a fever
-as she clutches Steve in her arms She wonders if her husband
does not take some pleasure in punishing the boys The moral
tortures are harder on them than the physical ones His

suspicious glances his mouth curling in scorn the
sentimentality that so quickly spills over into cruelty

What is she to do Confronting him only makes the situation
worse He will stop at nothing to win an argument

MOTHER
(later)
You hardly know them Youre gone
all the time

FATHER
I have to support my family

MOTHER
You speak without listening to
-them You never listen to anyone
else You interrupt Theres no
length you wont go to get your
way

She looks at him as one who once loved him and no longer
does so it seems to him

FATHER
If its such a hell why dont you
leave

She suspects that he wants to degrade her because he has
never been ableto possess her soul Always she has managed
to move beyond his reach

MOTHER
What about them Wouldnt I have
gone long ago except for them
Havent I been sorry that I didnt

FATHER
What are you waiting for

MOTHER
I would be only too glad to get
away from you --

She cannot control her words They fly out of her mind like
sparks

FATHER
You left me long ago
MOTHER
Keep your voice down
FATHER
You turned away from me the day

your first child was born

He suspects that she hates him It causes him to offend her
violently

MOTHER
Coming home late -- ambl ing their
future away You took the money RL
saved from his paper route -

FATHER
I put it back Im an outsider to
you arent I You hold yourself
apart Proud of your virtue You
want to make me better than I am

Why can she not be content with what he is Why will she only
have him as he ought to be

MOTHER
Youre always so angry Why
FATHER
I want a life without lies
MOTHER
What js eating at you
FATHER
“Nothing Do I disgust you
MOTHER
I love you
FATHER

Maybe you dont

She risks less than he does She has her worth which she can
never lose And the children whom he does not have

FATHER (CONTD)
You put them up to your tricks You
teach them to hate me Their own
father

Her blood rises in a jet Jack listens Will theirs be a
family like Howards The world is darker than he imagined

How shall he comfort his mother Redeem her sorrow He thinks
of Christmas when home is home when for a day they are a
family the bright colors beneath the tree lights burning
late into the night

He plays with a flashlight shining it through his hand
exposing the bones of his fingers

INT BOYS ROOM - LATER

The boys cower in their room Mr OBrien bangs his fist on
the formica as Mrs OBrien sobs

FATHER
Isnt a wife supposed to love
cherish obey

Jack fears his fathers wild energy He has got to fight him
every inch of the way in order not to be swamped engulfed -—-
to stay alive He clings to RL and Steve He will never leave
his brothers

JACK
(in a whisper)
We have each other

BACK TO PARENTS

Shame has come over Mr OBrien He has fallen She knows it
She suffers from his fall more than he does

PATHER
Bachs sons revered him -- kissed
his handg They played music
together for hours on end Their
home was a haven of peace
Jubilation I cant get them to
touch the piano

He is pitiless but she will not be swayed The purity of her
conduct is her strength She will not give him the right to
despise her

He touches her cheek kisses her Nothing is mended He made
up his mind long ago not to understand

Later a sense of her own loneliness comes over her as she
reads a letter from her brother

EXT KIMBALLS CLOTHESLINE

Alone Jack walks past a neighbors clothesline White
underclothes hang among the sheets and towels

Jack remembers going by the Browns one night in search of an
overthrown ball how he saw Mr Brown strike his wife in the
presence of their children No one else witnessed the event
The Browns had been a family whose happiness was taken for
granted It now seems to Jack that behind the calm facade of
ordinary life there might lie something dark and shameful

EXT WOODS

The woods are full of drafts like a Sprinqfed pool Jack
walks under the trees seeking a presence he has known here
before

Nature is free and without blemish The rustling leaves
refresh his shattered nerves Their spirit is his mothers
own A presence yes It speaks Come it says find me In
me you will discover that which does not fail or disappoint
An unseen hand ceaselessly touches his face his heart

How to see as the oak tree does

EXT OBRIEN HOUSE

The brothers are playing after school

RL
Its going to rain

SACK
Who seys

RL

I can mate it rain

The sky is blue But RL does a little dance inviting the
clouds to come Later on they do The rain pours down RL is
modest in his victory Jack laughs Now trouble seems a
dream

RL (CONTD)
I dont lie that much

Gazing at his brother he hears the same voice which he heard
among the trees It beckons him Where
70

THE NEXT DAY

Mr OBrien seems to have forgotten yesterdays scene at the
dinner table Not the children Nor his wife It lies across
the family like a shadow

FATHER
Give me a kiss

RL does
EXT KIMBALLS HOUSE - WIND CHIMES

Some days later Jack hears the tinkling of the wind chimes at
the Kimballs house Wandering towards it he notices their
car pulling away He waits then cavtiovsiy he enters their
garage A door leads from the laundry room jnto the house He
looks around to see in anyone is watching ten quietly he
opens it

INT KIMBALLS HOUSE

He wanders through the unfamiliar rooms The house ticks in
the heat There is money on the kitchen counter but he
ignores it With a mounting dread he approaches the stairs
that lead up to the sleeping quarters

What lies up there He touches the banister but dares not go
further After a moment he retreats back the way he came

He stands outside in the sunlight stunned What else is he
capable of

INT KITCHEN
His mother sees that he is troubled

MOTHER
What is it Tell me

JACK
Nothing

She goes back to what she was doing He feels queasy and
confused for having told a lie

JACK (CONTD)
I went in the Kimballs house They
werent there

MOTHER
Why did you do it You cant go in
when they arent there

JACK
The door was open

MOTHER
They leave it open because they
expect you wont go in Never do it
again Promise me Thank you

JACK
Are you going to tell Dad

She hesitates a moment then shakes her head With her there
is forgiveness Whether or not you ask for it Whether or not
you deserve it

LATER THAT NIGHT

A figure stands by his bed that night He touches the crown
of his head

INT LIVING ROOM
His father gives Jack a lecture

FATHER
Dont try to make people love you
Make them fear you If someone
clips you sock him back Who can
you trust Your own family Be good
to them Thats enough Your mother
is naive It takes fierce will to
get aheod in this world Dont let

anyone sta nd in your way

MOTHER
(looking in)
He needs to get to school

FATHER

This is more important This is
school Please

(after she leaves)
Dont let your own laziness stand
in your way You dont have to --
pardon the expression - kiss
anyones derriere Nobility is a
luxury Avoid controversy Every
one of these top executives you ©
know how they get to where they
are They float it down the middle
of the river

Mother and father live inside him They wrestle for his soul
He strives to reconcile them but they refuse to be
reconciled Why can he not find a harmony between them Which
party is he of Let it be one or the other not the chaos of
their blind struggle

He remembers his mother telling him

MOTHER
Be good sweetheart If someone
hurts you forgive him

JACK
(interrupting)
Why shouldnt I get whatI want
They do What about me

MOTHER
People hurt each other T would be
easy to be happy if they didnt

You have to overlook it -- give in
sometimes even if youre in the
right

What is the fate of those who live by love the golden rule

Steve is playing in the sprinkler outside as happy as Jack
once was still on the far bank of a river which Jack himself
has already crossed over

JACK
Are you going to leave us
(She shakes her
head)
Is he -

Jack wonders if he reall wishes it When he comes out of his
daydream his father is still talking

FATHER
-- If youre good people take
advantage of you Think of yourself
as someone caught behind enemy
lines Work Fight I see you
wasting your time -- staring out
the window -- playing I make
sacrifices for you You honor those
sacrifices by what you do Thats
how a familyworks

Jack shifts uneasily in his chair

FATHER (CONTD)
Id like to do what I want too I
dreamed of being a great musician
But how could I make a living for
my family And so I have to go off
every day --

(with emotion)

My father lost his job Ed was off
in Vegas he sent nothing home I
had to quit school and join the
Army Air Corps so your grandmother
could have something to eat They
shut the lights out on her We
couldnt pay the electricity She
had to take in boarders

Jack thinks of the love he often feels for his father as he
falls asleep at night listening to him at the piano --

FATHER (CONTD)
See this You know why I keep it
here It was the official seal of
my own company the one I formed --
I had the papers -- till I got
hepatitis from drinking
unpasteurized beer in China They
took it away from me Its dog eat
dog out there Dont you forget it
Dont let anyone tell you theres
anything you cant do Ive
protected you as best I can But I
didn get an education You will
You tl get through By God you
wilk You cant fool me I know you

like a beokl

Jack imagines resting w his fathers arms their differences
forgotten Then the ‘fantastic scene breaks up and he is back
in the living room sunk in silence

FATHER (CONTD)
When you came into this world you
know what I did I went outside and
danced on the lawn I shot off my
pistol Youre my freedom Every
time I see a young guy walk by with
a shirt and tie looking sharp
thats my kid Im looking at Dont
do like I did though Promise me
that I let myself get sidetracked
‘While youre looking for something
to happen that was it That was
life You lived it

FATHER (CONTD)
- (shaking his head)
I let one thing after another drag
me backwards We stuck together
though When you have nothing
youve still got your honor Your
dignity You still have each other

EXT STREET —- STRAY DOG

A stray dog appears a stranger to the neighborhood It bumps
into things It seems that it might be blind

Curious nonchalant it trots through the street until
Howards purple-tongued chow materializes out of nowhere to
attack it The boys look on in horror as Shep joins in the
fight His hostility towards a poor defenseless creature
astonishes themIt seems there iS no ie ts for the weak the
helpless no quarter given And the truth Jack himself
does not mind watching things get worse Tt “is not until some
of the adults roll out a hose and Stov4 Spraying water on the
dogs that he comes to himself and pulls Shep ‘away

MR BATES (0S)
Somebody must have let it go Got
too old went blind -- they didnt
have the heart to put it to sleep
Probably I should get my shotgun
and shoot it

JACK
Stay here

Shep will not look Wim in his eye but twists and turns eager
to get back into the Fray

Later the sane afternoon they hear the screech of brakes and
a strange Vyele Then far away a soft wail or moan
Steve breaks high tears

EXT VACANT LOT - DUSK
They wade through the weeds of a vacant lot where the dog
has gone to die From time to time they hear its haunting
ery They cannot find it only a trail of blood Wounded
afraid it keeps dragging itself away from them
EXT OBRIEN HOUSE (BACKYARD)
Jack listens as Steve questions their mother

STEVE

What happens when you die Does it
hurt Does it happen to everyone

MOTHER
Sooner or later

STEVE
Theres nothing you can do about
it Will you die too

It seems the grown-ups understand things no better than he
does

MOTHER
Not for a long time

STEVE
Will I

RL
Youre not that old yet Mom

STEVE
Where do you go

Jack sees his mother with new eyes now The day might come
when she must leave them

STEVE (OS) (CONTD)
Who put the spikes on the sun

He remembers when she got her fingers caught in the Mixmaster
and cried out to him to jerk the cord from the wall A quick
flash --

EXT OBRIEN HOUSE

He remembers too a day whem they were eating outdoors with
the neighbors aud suddeuly he heard someone shouting There
was a coral snake on the ground She walked right past it

He watched how it flowed unhindered over the ground as if
free of friction or restraint beyond any human power of
control cryptic a dark enigma with lidless eyes

MRS BATES
She walked right past it

MR BATES
Get a hoe Its mate must be around
here You watch couple of days and
itll turn up

Mr Bagley chops the snake in two with a hoe Mr Bates
stamps on the severed head

MR BAGLEY
Nothing you can do if one of them
bites you Against a copperhead
youve got a chance Not theseuns
Once they close their mouth they
cant let go Even if they wanted
to Red on yellow kill a fellow

EXT PATIO
The next morning RL turns to his mother

RL
Wheres Dad

MOTHER
Gone on a trip

The boys go wild They crawl around on the floor they bounce
on the beds they let the screen door slam carelessly behind
them She cannot contain their energy

JACK
Were going to stay up late

MOTHER
Oh no youre not

STEVE
All night Dont say no because
you know it makes me angry Look at
me © mean it

They run through the sprinkler Finding a lizard they chase
her into the batwroom with it Laughing they ignore her
pleas and when they hear the lock click shut they slip it
in under the door

MONTAGE - WHILE THEIR FATHER IS AWAY

She shows them flowers glowing colors and birds that sing
the fruit tree at the edge of the woods the gardenias the
wings of little creatures beneath a magnifying glass So many
mysteries She shows them a barn swallows nest

MOTHER
They trust us -- not to knock it
down

She gives them a book of natural history His hands leaf
‘through the pages There are dinosaurs frogs and armor-
plated fish with names too long to pronounce The Seven
Wonders of the Ancient World

She shows them the leaf of a tall locust tree and sets it
next to a pea vine demonstrating the family relation there
sometimes is between things large and small For a time all
is as it was The hours go by uncounted

STEVE
Can I marry you when I grow up
(she laughs)
Dont tell anyone else

It makes Jack ill at ease to see his mother cuddling Steve

JACK
He drank all the milk and didnt
leave us any

Steve bolts out the door and runs around naked in the rain
The thunder and lightning delight him the water rushing
through the gutters sucking at his ankles so cool

MOTHER
You little devil Come back here

RL
Mom I see that thing again

MOTHER
What thing

RL
The suckin’ goat

STEVE
TH ll suck you down that hole by
the fence Tt get you while
youre not looking It got Woodys
doa Snates Hit the lights

Later they watch from another room as she dances by herself
to some music on the radio

Jack remembers a dream he once had of his mother lying like
Snow White in a glass coffin Her beautiful red cheeks her
hair black as the night How would he face the world without
her He cannot bear the thought that he might have a separate
destiny

EXT OBRIEN HOUSE
Jack brings a jar of ice water and a plate of sandwiches out

to 0C a laborer whom his father has hired to spread fresh
loam on the yard

OC
Your mother sent this Well shes
the nicest lady Shes a good
mother and a good woman I never
worked for nobody as considerate

His salmon-colored palms grip the shovel He works all day
long in the broiling sun He never complains There is a joy
it seems which is compatible with hardship and misfortune

JACK

Have you seen my fireflies
He shows 0C the bottle filled
OC
Those are the souls of dead people
You should let them ge Did TK scare
you I didnt mean t

EXT HOUSE ROOF

They are up on the roof of a house They have no business
there and they know it Jack nods for RL to jump off

JACK
You have to if you want to join
the club
RL
Why dont you
JACK
T alveady did
RL
when
JACK

You werent around

They laugh Later he dares his brother to stick a coat
hanger into a light socket

JACK (CONTD)
I turned it off It wont hurt I
tested it

RL smiles when nothing happens But then as they are roaming
around Jack snatches a stick out of RLs hand He does not
protest

RL
You can have it

There is another spirit in his brother than Jack finds in
himself Ashamed he gives the stick back Hearing their
mothers voice calling them in they turn home

EXT NEIGHBORHOOD —- ROBERT

Robert has reappeared in their lives He leads them on a
spree of destruction He encourages them to steal peaches
from McKeevers tree

ROBERT
They belong to ever Yeeey » Nobody
tells me what to dol ust do
what I want -

Instead of eating the peaches they threw’them away One
after another they break out laughing until they are all
rolling on the ground

Jack pulls up flowers from the Kimbalis bed He enjoys the
boys approval He is ashamed to be guilty of less impudence
than the others but when Robert nods at the windows of the
Stickleys garage he remembers his mothers stern injunction
and shakes his head

ROBERT (CONTD)
Why not

They put a toad on a skyrocket and send it off then run to
see whether it Survived its skyward flight Gone They cannot
find it And they had felt ite life pulse in their hands

They put a Shapping turtle on Sheps ear

HARRY
It wont let go till sunset

Shep howls with pain and runs away glancing over his
shoulder with a look of injured trust

They stamp on snails burn up wasps They make a glory of
their infamy and lies

CAYLER
Im six feet tall I killed a man

EXT COURTHOUSE AND JAIL

Another day outside the courthouse Jack looks up and sees a
man shouting from a window on the second floor There are
bars on the window hands are thrust through them

Nearby on the sidewalk he sees a prisoner who has been led
down the front steps ‘of the courthouse by two men with guns
high on their hips

The group passes close by The prisoners wrists are bound to
a restraining belt He answers the taunting eyes of
courthouse loafers with a sneer of proud defiance Somehow
Jack feels close to him closer moment to this
stranger than to his own family uo

MOTHER
What are you looking at Come

One of the policemen stares at him What does he know or
guess

Men rise to their feet as Mrs OBrien passes by
EXT OBRIEN HOUSE

Mr OBrien returns from his travels The children glance at
each other It is as though a stranger had appeared in their
midst The idyll is over They must again be the furtive
creatures the cheats the guilty ones they were before

He pats them on their heads a little too hard

INT DINING ROOM

Mr OBrien tells of his travels -- shows them the towels and
washcloths he has cavrieqd off from hotels and money in
denominations so large that were it dollars they would be
rich

FATHER

Bishop Sheen was down the hall --
two doors away Very friendly The
French are lovable but theyll rob
you blind The moneys confusing
new francs old francs you never
know which youve got in your hand
I bought a newspaper for 4
Halfway back to the hotel I
realized Id been robbed Had a big
fight with the lady Had to call a
gendarme He got her to cough up

(to Mrs OBrien)

FATHER (CONTD)
Im confident my deal went through
If not they can forget it Ill
tell them all to go to hell

MOTHER
Be careful
FATHER
Im not going to let them shove me
around
RL
Can Cayler come over
FATHER
Your own family iswt ape enovoh

for you

Jack looks at his brother with Suvprise We would never dare
to invite anyone over Relatives visit ofjtey but no friend
ever comes to their house

FATHER (CONTD)
Your mothers from a farm family
Irish They had people down from
Chicago every weekend Thats why
they never got the weeds out of
their fields The Norwegians would
drive by and laugh
(she smiles)
You boys dont realize it but
were skating on thin ice You live
ain peace quiet in warmth Look at
the Focd you have Still on your
plate The abundance When I was
OVI age T was chomping tickets at
the Clarand Theater in Chicago
(Jack squirms)

Are you ina hurry After the
shows I cleaned the bathrooms For
years I had one pair of pants The
same green pants I had to run
around in my shorts while my mother
washed them And still for all
that father was always father to
me Nobody knows what that means
these days Can a child understand

It seems to Jack that he and his brothers remain alive
through their fathers sacrifice and bear their lives as an
undeserved gift from him His father has bred in him a deep
suspicion of himself a doubt of his every action a doubt of
others too and of their motives He is becoming anxious
about everything wavering unable to work out a thought

There is a loud crash He let the screen door slam shut

FATHER (CONTD)
You cant shut it softly can you
No thats too hard for you I
Suppose You dont have the time
Thats too much to expect of our
worthy son Horsefeathers I want
you to shut it quietly fifty
times Not a word of contradiction

It seems to him there are three worlds one in which he and
his brothers live subject to their father under laws which he
has invented for them only and which the can never without
understanding why ever fully comply with a second world
that their father belongs to a thir Wheve everyone else
lives happily free from orders ancl Nav ing to obey

FATHER
Come here
(pinching him)
I love you If it doesnt always
seem that way its because I cant
pretend like other people do Kiss
me Kiss your father

Jacks mind leaps about bewildered by his fathers health
and appetite his swagger his canniness his indifference to
the burdens he imposes on others the absence of any
consciousness of hypocrisy when he breaks those rules he
imposes on others

FATHER (CONTD)
What are you ‘thinking Really
Minkina ‘There are things you
cant db Well there are things 1
cant do either

JACK
(hesitantly)
Dad Why --
FATHER

Youre not to call me Dad but
Father Father sir Always honor
your father Every day I go out
that door there I go out and work
my tail off for you Show respect
Dont interrupt

JACK
You do

FATHER
I would rather be a beggar on the
streets of Cairo than not to have
the respect of my family
(after a pause)
Remember you’re the child

Jack counts his breaths

JACK
This is your house You can throw
me out whenever you like
(quaking all over)
You want to kill me

FATHER
I too didnt have ‘any respect for
my father Not at First

What do his boys know of life -- the rich mans arrogance
the triumph of the fool

FATHER (CONTD)

I saw my mother - she couldnt
read or write -- dependent ona
salesman who couldnt make sales
and was ashamed to tell her sol
Then I learned how things were for
him He died before you boys were
born -- in a hit-and-run accident
He lay all night in the street It
was dawnwhen they found him Do
Whet you like though As far as

- Im concerned youre free I have
No advicete give you But if you
reali want to be free dont come
back te tis house in the evening --

His nerves are on fire His sons seem to be destroying him
He is forced to breathe the air of his own death

JACK
I hate you

FATHER
I know The question is ate you
going to do what I tell you to Do
you want to be the only one whos
out of step -- and make everyone
else unhappy -- just because youre
determined to have your own way
Then youll stay indoors

FATHER (CONTD)
You just wont have dinner tonight
None of us will

Jack looks at his mother He does not want to bring her any
more unhappiness

JACK
Im sorry sir

FATHER
Thank you for saying Sir
(to his wife)
You know what they say in the Navy
If you have a grumbling crew you-
have a fit crew When they dont
grumble somethings wrong

He will learn to deceive He will use coming and guile to
defend himself and get what he wants

He will never outwardly defy his father nis defiance will be
inward and therefore harder to root out first it must be
detected He will avenge himself in the cleverest way
without his fathers ever knowing it

INT BEDROOM
Mr and Mrs OBrien are alone

FATHER
-- I want to make him strong I
want him to expect great things of
himself -- to hold himself with the
besi A father gives his child
Strength Will

MOTHER
Theyre afraid of you

FATHER
They love me Im going to make
them do it I could have had my own
company - been a wealthy man But
no we had kids -- I had to take
the first job that came along --
Am I a father or a faucet

MOTHER
Why dont you let yourself -- love

FATHER
(surprised)
I do

MOTHER
-- Let yourself show it

He looks away He is afraid of her love for him It is too
good for him He cannot measure up to it

It seems to him she does not want him but his soul
INT LIVING ROOM

When they next see their father he pretends nothing is
wrong Does he think they could not hear

FATHER
What do you want for your birthday
RL
You
His father looks at him in surprise -- this child so unlike
the others gentle as a sage -- then kisses him RL alone

does not stiffen under these effusions of paternal love Mr
OBrien feels that he understands the other two but there is
something about RL which strikes a certain awe in him

Yet he fears for this child fears he is impractical a
dreamer dawdler He rides him about a hundred things for
walking funny for smiling too long for hesitating before he
speaks

Does his mother love him because he is the weakest the
tenderest the most siucere Sincere people are taken
advantageof Dreamers come to nothing

EXT CARPORT

-dack watches his father work on the Studebaker which he has
raised up on a jack What would happen if he kicked it out

-- Christmas scenes Other houses on the block Each is a
home Is his The singing the lights -- ruined by argument
discord --—

SERIES OF ANGLES - STRAIGHT RAZOR - ROUGH GREEN SNAKE

His rage is deep as hell He studies his fathers straight
razor with its tortoiseshell handle Afraid of the darkness
rising up within him he hides it under the sheets in the
linen closet Alone in his bedroom he prays

JACK
Please God let him die

A snake slides through the oak tree swaying as the wind
blows matching the movement of the branches

EXT OBRIEN HOUSE (FRONT YARD)
Mr OBrien walks outside Jack and RL are playing

FATHER
What are you doing playing out
here Get to work
(turning to RL)
Did you practice your guitar

INT LIVING ROOM - RL WITH GUITAR - JEALOUSY

Jack watches RL practice on a half-sceale guitar He is a true
musician unlike his brothers

Their mother listens rapt as she dandles Steve on her knee
When RL gets frustrated with his mistakes she consoles him

MOTHER
Its alright to make mistakes You
have to Perfection isnt
important Imperfection is
beautiful Even more beautiful

Mr OBrien sits down at the piano and adds an accompaniment
to RLs melody Jealousy of his little brother stirs in Jack
again even as the music brings him back into a presence in
which he had ceased to believe

EXT NEIGHBORHOop STREET

He remembers walking with RU earlier in the day He suggested
that they run

RL
Well get tired
JACK
Not me I never get tired

RL
You did this morning

JACK

No I didnt I was just pretending
You want to call me a liar

RL
No I dont want to fight

JACK
Afraid to

RL
No I just dont want to

JACK
If I was to say youre scared
would you want to call me a liar

RL
No

JACK
Then youre scared arent you

RL
I guess so Why do bees hum
(Jack shrugs)
Because they dont know the words

Chastened Jack mumbles an apology Love takes the place of
envy in his heart All nature comes alive and answers him
approvingly

Mrs OBrien worries about hereldest son Conflict with his
father has caused him to become a glum inattentive
disobedient child always intent on escape

His life has become a tissue of lies and subterfuge Thefts
lust savage desires He is lost in this new darkness and
hardly cares His is in revolt

EXT FRONT YARD
Jack stands witw Wis ‘mother in the front yard

MOTHER
Look at the tree It doesnt care
- how it seems to others It just is
It puts up with storms rain bad
weather -

The camera plays over the leaves and branches Me spirit
lives in root and trunk branch and leaf

MOTHER (0S) (CONTD)
A leaf might think it is separate
and alone but all the leaves are
part of the same unfolding They
start from the same seed

JACK
(interrupting)
He tells me one thing You tell me
another

Inwardly she resigns herself to losing her eldest son

MOTHER
Everything will be all right

JACK
Then why are you unhappy

MOTHER
What makes you say that

He sees the abuse which goodness Suees in ‘this world the
painful consequences of walking in his motnecs way Where
does it lead To a life of sorrow foral that he can tell

What is the value of goodness How shall it stand against
bullying force The golden rule allows others to take
advantage of you to do as they please It opposes and can
even destroy your own happiness

He remembers Mrs Kimball telling his mother

MRS KIMBALL
Youre so kind I wish that I could
be like you

FATHERS POV ON SONS PLAYING

Mr OBrien watches From afar as his sons play with their
mother in the front yard Will he grow mean and despicable
Fall slowly into cuia Their laughter is like the music of a
lost Eden

INT LIVING ROOM

Her brother their Uncle Ray has come to visit Mrs OBrien
confides in him unaware that Jack is listening from the
other room

MOTHER
A man showed up at the door A bill
collector A shady character Hes
been gambling again

Much of what she says plays 0S as her memories are
illustrated starting with scenes from Las Vegas quick
flashes of their past experience

MOTHER (CONTD)
He is fascinated with cards He
says they make everyone even He
over-bets his hand You know his
brother is a keno dealer in Las
Vegas A sweet gifted man

(after a pause)

He wants his honor back His
stature I could get a job He
doesnt want me to though

UNCLE RAY
Its hard with three boys

MOTHER

I wouldnt like to veset them or
change their life ZT want them to
get a good education

(sighing)
Compared to ours his family seemed
so warm and vital He was earthy
cheerful We were happy for a time

(after a pause)
I tremble to ask him for money I
come to him like a guilty person
He makes a fuss over a bent spoon
He wont do anything to change I
dread him coming into the room

UNCLE RAY
Tell him Either he learns to
behave like everyone else or He
Adoesv know what love is anyway

MOTHER
why do you say that

UNCLE RAY
Leave

Jack looks up shocked Would she Has he with his
complaints about his father contributed to such a desire
fears that he might cause the breakup of his family

UNCLE RAY (CONTD)
Take the boys with you Your
patience is wonderful But what if
its killing you

MOTHER
I can’t trade their happiness for
mine It would haunt me Ive
thought about it
MOTHER (CONTD)

I still know shorthand When I
worked at Bendix before we got
married I could type a hundred
words a minute I dont know what I
could do now With three
children Dont remind me that I
ever talked this way Youre my
only friend The others theyre
very nice but I cant really talk
with them Its a small town

UNCLE RAY
You cant let it keep you from

MOTHER

He hasnt filed an income tay

cold man But he turns people
against him He offends them —-
almost on purpose He loves me as
much as he can What a day it was
when I first saw his real nature
But hes a good provider He works
hard There are two people in him

She is loathe to reveal to anyone even her brother how
unhappy she is or to betray her husbands confidence

UNCLE RAY
Do you love him still
(she nods)

Bob could help you

MOTHER
Hell never pay that back He
resents it when I ask So does
Ellen I wish Id finished college-
I dreamt of studying medicine

They laugh Flashes of her carefree youth a ride in a
biplane spinning at a dance

MOTHER (CONTD)
We all had dreams I want the kids
to get through college It makes me
happy seeing you

She has never quite found a stream of fellowship in Waco

LATER

EXT OBRIEN HOUSE - LAWN -— OAK TREE - NIGHT

Only the porch light is burning Jack has slipped out of the

JACK (CONTD)

He will take her tears away She shakes her head That is not
what she wants

MOTHER

His efforts to make her proud have g0 fac had the ironic
consequence of causing her endless woccuy

JACK
Thats not enough 1 can do more

EXT POOL (BARTON SPRINGS) - QUICK ANGLES (MEMORY)

Milton Stone a boy Jacks age is swimming an underwater
race at a public pool when suddenly he turns over on his
back and floats up to the surface his arms thrown wide The
other boys think he is kidding and splash him with water
until they see his lips are blue Panic spreads Many shrink
away but Mr OBrien comes forward to take command of the
situation He calls for an ambulance He breathes into
Miltons mouth The boys stand in the shallows hold hands
and say the Lords prayer Jack looks left and right proud
of his father who gazes at Mrs Stone with a heartfelt
sympathy

EXT PORCH - RESUMING THE FOREGOING SCENE - NIGHT

Jack marvels atWwis mother She seems never to want anything
She does not vacy ike their father is constant in temper

JACK
Were not a happy family are we
We were before Will our family be
like Howards
(she kisses him)
Now at school when I see good
kids I want to be bad

She is silent for a moment

MOTHER
I dont know all things I havent
been everything a mother should be
But a parent learns She has to
grow up too
94

MOTHER (CONTD)
There are a lot of hard things in
this world I wish I could keep
them all away from you

JACK
Have I done anything wrong today

MOTHER
No Things may seem bad now but
they wont always be this way

good Well go away this summer and
rent a cabin by the lake Dad will
tell you about the places hes
been And Ill tell you abovt the
day when I was a agic and a
rhinoceros escaped From xe Fail

INT LIVING ROOM

Mr OBrien is baffled by thé opposition which he creates for
himself Home should be a haven from the worlds contempt
The ingratitude of children can drive a man to madness

He keeps the familys life from being either comfortable or
tedious They ivejino continual state of uncertainty In
his better moods he ig their comic He plays the piano like
Harpo Marx in A Night at the Opera He lights a cork blows
it out and apeliesitg dack ash to his upper lip to create a
dandys movstacnete puts on airs and acts out dramas He
sits at the piano and makes it all up as he goes along like
‘a little opera

Mrs OBrien laughs as he leaps over the sofa fencing now
He is like a child himself with sudden spasms of craving for
physical affection -- for proofs of a sentimental love

Jack remembers other times when he has felt close to his
father How precious how wonderful those hours were Lying
on the car seat and listening to him sing to himself at the
steering wheel as they went on vacation --

FATHER

Come on 345 x 78 Visualize it

Try again In your mind Youre not
trying Pay attention Trust me
Im doing this to help you

FATHER (CONTD)
What is it I want you to stand
there till you tell me

RL stands in place until the sun goes down Steve turns to
his father

STEVE
Who are you

Mr OBrien looks at him surprised
EXT KIMBALLS HOUSE - WIND CHIMES

Jack notes how Mrs Kimballs thin cotton dress clings to her
in the heat She drinks from a hose tne water flows over her
bare feet

MRS KIMBALL
You want a drink

He shakes his head She is a kind lovely woman shy

Later he paces back and forth outside the Kimball house
until he sees her through the open drapes

Later still as night is falling he walks past the Bates
eager to see more There is an odd gray flicker on the
ceiling in the living room TV has entered the neighborhood
though no one thinks much of it and only the Bates have a
set

EXT WELLS‘ HOUSE
Howard has a ook of dread on his face Jack frowns

HOWARD
Dads come back

Jack is transported to the scene in Howards recounting of
it

MR WELLS (0S)
What am I doing Minding my
binness Go cut a switch

Howard cuts a switch off a willow tree Mrs Wells closes
herself up inside her bedroom

Howard watches his father come towards him no not a father
but a beast of wrath and sensuous intoxication As the blows
fall the boys cries excite him to greater cruelty

MR WELLS (CONTD)
(chewing gum)
Lick the floor with your tongue
Pay Somebodys going to pay

He takes Howard outside and shoves him down into the storm
cellar shuts the door and sets the chow to guard it In the
darkness below Howard wails and weeps and pounds his face
with his fists Daddy Daddy Please Daddy He clenches his
fists and beats his chest and begs heaven to protect him It
goes on until he can scream no more but gasps for breath

HOWARD
Dear God Help us Please

NEXT DAY
The next day Jack listens as RL tetis weit mother

RL

true

MOTHER
Maybe -- but such a long time from
now it doesnt matter

Math geography boundaries and rules Day by day the adult
world closes i¢el€ about him

He gazes at MarshaSo this is love Where might it lead you
It is like returning to you original state -- like being
healed

EXT CITY - A LATE AFTERNOON IN MAY

The boys are playing outside when the wind comes up In the
south the sky has turned black

The branches of the oak tree rise and fall The wind grows
stronger Shep looks up puzzled A newspape flies through
the street The boys drift inside The windows move as if
they were breathing The radio announces an approaching
storm

TORNADO - STOCK (35MM) - DUSK NIGHT
A tornado bears down on the town There is lightning then

hail big hailstones that bounce off the street The wind
makes a roar like a train

Lawn furniture toys and garbage cans are swept along the -
street The front door rattles until it seems the glass might
break The laundry line flies out like a flag

A tree has fallen in the middle of the street illuminated by
the headlights of a swerving car Downed power lines spew
showers of sparks Everyone is solemn and still It seems
some elemental violence has come forth to threaten good and
wicked alike a great power ready at any time to sweep down
on men with an unbridled cruelty tearing the life and hope
out of them destroying the labor of their years

The hailstones split the windshield of a car smash leaves
and branches off the trees The doors fly open Curtains are
sucked out the window There is a chags of thunder and
lightning At length the power go0¢ ous Tneie mother appears
with a candle and leads them away from the widows The flame
wavers threatens to go out

The radio narrates the rest how an electrician working on
the roof of a building downtown fell five stories when it
collapsed and walked away -how all went black as power lines
‘popped like strings The National Guard has been called out
the horn of a flattened truck is still blowing etc

EXT NEIGHBORHOOD EVIDENCE OF TORNADOS PASSAGE

The next day the children are out in the streets with the
grown-ups noting signs of the tornados passage the clothes
of strangers hanging from the branches of a tree a chair a
tricycle too a catfish sucked up from the lake and dropped
on the lawn a tree struck by lightning split down the
middle stripped of its leaves and bark

A house has been tossed into a field down the road its
intimate Contents scattered through the street A car lies
demolished while aeyt to it another has gone untouched A
vase stands vadisturhed in a demolished room Strangers stare
at a family which has ggt its home The full wrath of the
skies has descended on them alone

RL
How does it pick

Uprooted trees lie scattered like bowling pins It is as if
the fabric of reality had been torn away and beyond it they
were given to gaze into some abyss of meaninglessness
futility and terror

MR BATES
McKeever died

MR KIMBALL
He never did nothing wrong

A neighbor has died a man they rarely saw Jack has no
reaction to this news -- only the fear that she might die
Where would they be then Word comes that a hundred and
fourteen others have shared Mr McKeevers fate

That night a figure of death appears to Jack in a dream She
leads him into an abandoned house She gives Mr McKeever a
cup to drink

JACKS POV ON HIS MOTHER

Jack observes his mother smiling as she helps RL with his
science project a model of the solar system It seems that
in’ some way she has betrayed him te €eels angry at her for
being so vulnerable so easily imposed voen When she asks
him to help her carry in the arocectes he ecexenads “ not to
have heard and walks away

LATER - HIS BROTHERS HAND

As Jack listens to RL practice the guitar he thinks of his
brothers hand how it played with the wind outside the
window of the moving car -- how it reached out to touch the
leaves of the tree in the front yard the bark -- the water
running from the hose and spreading across the smooth
concrete of the driveway --

INT OBRIEN HOUSE
His mother speaks in a hushed voice into the phone

MOTHER
Now hes sold our stocks the few
we move--Dack is acting up at
Scroal geting into trouble —-

INT SCHOOL ROOM

Jack competes with a boy named Billy for the title of class
clown While Mr Reese is giving dictation he stands up and
asks

JACK
How do you spell the

Everyone laughs He did not ask it as a joke however He
genuinely forgot Marsha looks away This sort of thing is
not likely to win her favor She does not return his greeting
in the hall

EXT STICKLEYS HOUSE

Jack stands with Robert and some of the other neighborhood
boys near the Stickleys garage

ROBERT
Where are you going

He can tell Jack is afraid of him

JACK
Were not supposed to bother them
ROBERT
Who says They dont use it

anyway

They look at each other a moment then Jack picks up a rock
The first one misses the second does net They break out in
laughter at the sound of the shattering glass

EXT LAUNDRY LINE WIND CHIMES MARTIN HOUSE

Jack walks through the clothes fluttering indiscreetly on the
Kimballs laundry line Purple martins flit about their happy
home

EXT KIMBALLS HOUSE - DAWN OF HIS MORAL AWARENESS

Jack is playing with the other boys when out of the corner

of his eye he sees Mrs Kimball driving away He turns back
to their games dAistcacted now He knows he must not go into
the house But the wish keeps interposing itself

The garage is still and cool There are a few wasps stirring
in the corner He e5 the door Once again it is open In
the distance he weacs the cries of his playmates

He hesitates This might be the first time he has ever made a
simple choice between good and evil right and wrong

Who would be hurt by his disobedience Yet this is the only
thing his mother has ever so plainly and explicitly
forbidden His heart pounds in his throat He turns away but
the wind chimes seem to draw his attention back to the door

INT KIMBALLS HOUSE
Crossing the threshold he feels a sort of vertigo a pride

in his cleverness a wild reckless joy in abandoning himself
to the forbidden

He wanders through the house examining things taking care to
put them back in their places He avoids the eyes of the
portraits on the wall He passes by the silver and china He
hesitates before the stairs that lead towards the bedroom
Dare he up

What do the adults know that he does not He longs to leave
his childhood behind

Inside the master bedroom all stands in impeccable order

He looks through Mrs Kimballs cosmetics then discovers the
chest of drawers where she keeps her clothes His breath
grows quick and shallow

He opens a drawer He gazes at the folded aarments He takes
out a nightgown

Suddenly a noise He looks up starts te leave then sees to
his surprise that he has left the drawer open He closes it
quietly

With the craft of a burglar he does not go back the way he
came but unlatches a screen and slips out a window at the
back of the house into the holly bushes with their sharp-
tipped leaves

EXT KIMBALLS HOUSE -

Outside he stands alone breathless Has anyone seen him He
glances at the gazing ball on its stand in the backyard

Uncertain what o do with the nightgown he hides it under a
board at the edgeorthe woods His eyes dart left and right
No normal boy wovld do this Of that he is sure He should
have stayed ourofF the house He chose not to He knows

Nature which once sang around him is silent now And yet he
feels a subtle alteration in himself a freedom with new
powers of reason and understanding So this is how they see
the world

With the opeming of his eyes new hopes awaken the promise
of new joys their taste so sweet in his anticipation of them
that all he has known before seems stale and flat

EXT OBRIEN HOUSE
He looks up It is his mother calling him Her voice floats

on the air barely perceptible through the hedges and back
yards He pretends not to hear

MOTHER (0S)
Where are you

She walks through the yard in the cool of the evening
repeating the question Where are you

He feels conscious of himself inwardly naked

He trudges heavily back toward his home It does not seem the
place he knew before He hears something like the breath or
footsteps of someone coming after him the voice of a
stranger far away --

NEW ANGLE - MOTHERS POVS - LETTING GO OF HAND

She gazes at him Something is Wrong His face is fallen
Love is not in it

He looks at her Does she know How cen h tell her all that
is in his heart He has broken faith with her

MOTHER
Where have you been

JACK
Out in the woods With Cayler

Once he starts he cannot stop

JACK (CONTD)
We found some bottles We broke
them Brown bottles

MOTHER
What is if) Sweetheart

He does not answer A ¢joud has come over his life A
burglar a liar a thief in bondage to strange forces the
good world forever in his past She would forgive but he
dares not ask He lets go of her hand

The tone and visual style of the picture have grown harder
more realistic disenchanted There are no hints or calls
from the transcendent world he knew in his play No more

What ship has carried him off To what far land

The change is indicated to him from all quarters the rotting
peaches on the tree the grackles gabbing with each other in
their roost the locked gate a threatening dog the porch
light the wind blowing uselessly this way and that

The stars and the trees have disappeared They are no more to
him than the wallpaper in his room He will never be a child
again

EXT OAK TREE

When he goes outside the oak tree does not speak with him as
before His own dog Shep looks at him as though he was a
stranger The little stream of his disobedience has grown
into a river and overspread the earth

INT SCHOOL ROOM

When Jack next speaks with his teacher he is very pleasant
and respectful if thoroughly insNcere Mr Reese is
deceived by the change in his behavior

MR REESE
Good job

JACK
Thank you

And so he learns to make his way in the world He has begun
to-be aware of how he appears to others and of what they
think of him That he can shape their impressions of him -—-
act friendly and compliant then go right on doing what he
pleases leaving them none the wiser

He will show a petty talent and success in school but alas
as a substitute for the real worth that his mother wishes him
to have

INT LIVING ROOM
Jack sees RL at work ona watercolor

JACK
Whats that

RL
Im painting it for mother For her
birthday

JACK
I got her a paperweight

Later he looks at his paperweight It is not as personal or
imaginative a gift as RLs though it- cost more Will she
understand

She thanks Jack for his gift but seems to appreciate RLs
more

MOTHER
How lovely

The next day Jack pours water over RLs work causing the
colors to run Later when she asks him not to slam the
screen door he replies

JACK
Im not going to do anything you
say

MOTHER
Well see

JACK

Im going to do what want
(after a pause)

What do you know You der him cun

all over you

He sees that his words have stung her He looks up at her
the one who knows him through and through and miraculously
still loves him

JACK (CONTD)
Whats happening to me I was so
happy before

Why does he do those very things which injure his mothers
happiness and cause her anxiety He vowed to make her happy
to redeem her sorrow Now he is the chief cause of it Will
his way lead farther and farther down into darkness and
night Already he eads the life of a spy

Mrs OBrien seés that she has lost him His soul has drifted
away He has grownhard and closed He has turned from her
way of doing thingStohis fathers though he admires his
fathers way less How soon before the other boys follow

INT LIVING ROOM

His mother and father argue She tries to keep her voice
down

MOTHER
Theyre just kids You cant expect
them to act like adults

to love you Why dont you go out
’ and play catch with them Praise

MOTHER
You turn people against you Youre
always saying foolish things about
the men above you You offend them
-- almost on purpose

FATHER
They need me More than T need

MOTHER

Why dont you tell me the truth
(after a silence)
Why do ‘you always have to pretend

FATHER
Pretend

EXT A NEIGHBORS HOUSE -— DUSK

Jack eavesdrops at doors He spies on a neighborhood woman
from the darkness outside her house He holds a sealed letter
up against the liqnt He sees a pin-up on a gas station wall
Something is pulling hin away from what is dearest to him

When RL calls nim to join in their childish games he shakes
his head He no fongerc cares to follow them into the woods

EXT OAK TREE FRONT YARD

RL whispers to Jack as he fingers the bark of the oak tree in
the front yard

RL
I know were unhappy now-- but if
we touch this tree -- listen it
will tell us
JACK

Caleecha Makeecha The words

JACK
What words

RL
The ones that will destroy all the
evil in peoples hearts and bring
them everything good They11 be
healthy None sick And theyll
never fight again Listen

Caleecha Makeecha He whispers the words to waken the tree
to persuade it to unfold its secret

JACK
I dont believe in tha Sturt any
more

EXT BATES HOUSE

The boys are playing on a slide at the Bates house Rusty
Wells has climbed to the top imagining that he too would
like to go down only to find that he is afraid

CAYLER
Everybody else has

Jack sneaks up the ladder and gives the trembling child a
push Rusty falls to the ground with a thud He looks up at
Jack whom he trusted as a friend and protector then bursts
into tears and runs off Howard does not protest but merely
bows his head and leads Rusty home walking a few paces in
front of him

JACK
You okay

Jack is astonished T is as though a devil had entered him

JACK (CONTD)
He was getting in my way

There are more and more things his mother and father do not
know about him and could not guess things that he is guilty
of far worse than any they have punished him for

This darkness in himself it lies in others too He remembers
standing in the dusk listening to Howard cry His father had
returned home and was beating him with a belt Why should the
tornado take better men and leave this beast to roam

Mrs OBrien has heard what Jack did to Rusty

JACK (CONTD)

Why do I do these things Youre
going to hate me I want to be like
I was before I want to be little
again

She strokes his back consoling him

JACK (CONTD)
I want to be someone else I always
do stupid things Sometimes I want
to run away Im afraid Im going
to turn into a killer Then I11
have to kill myself I mess up I
dont know why I can make my hand
write a word on a piece of paper
But when I want to act right I
cant do it You dont loveme
anymore Momma You dont come and
give me hugs like you used to How
can I be good Whys it so hard

She looks at him and smiles He hears a train whistle far
away

JACK (CONTD)
Starting tomorrow Im going to
change Mr Reese is going to give
a silver dollar to the one who
reads the most books I want you to
be hard with me -- to shout at me
Im ‘na to be a new kid tomorrow

INT OBRIEN HOUSE- RADIO SHOWS OS

He turns from the outdoors to occupy his days with the radio
the Sears catalogue and other things of the world

INT BATHROOM

Earlier he was not embarrassed to go naked in his mothers
presence Now when she comes upon him getting out of the
shower he quickly shuts the door

INT BOYS ROOM

One night for no reason RL starts repeating his name Jack
pinches him on the arm to get him to stop

RG
Brother

JACK
When I hit you you dont hit back
Why

His brother is more genial Why would he not be preferred

Then the idea sets in He will punish his mother through her
favorite He will make himself deliberately and knowingly
unlovable He will flaunt his worthlessness as a protest

Now he is alone -- alone with his frailty with the struggle
of light and darkness in his soul A tide is carrying him
away from those whom he should love whose love towards him
has not changed in the least

EXT SCHOOL GROUNDS

A student rings the bell for class

INT MR REESES OFFICE

Jacks mother has been called in for a conference

MR REESE
He interrupts the class He doesnt
listen to instructions Hes afraid
to finish his painting or write a
sentence -- afraid it might be
wrong He copied his report out of
the World Book

MOTHER
He cheated

Later she sees him hit himself in the face in frustration
She decides it is time to take steps

INT LIVING ROOM
Jack overhears his parents discussing his future

MOTHER (0S)
Maybe we should send him away to
school

FATHER (0S)
We dont have the money The
other boys cant go It wouldnt be
fair

MOTHER (0S)
I can work I could get a job

FATHER (0S)
People would wonder what was
wrong Wed lose face
EXT FIELD
Jack leads his brother out into the field beyond the house

JACK
Ive got something to show you

RL wants to go back Something about his manner is odd

JACK (CONTD)
We can shoot wasps -

Jack has brought his BB gun He urges his brother to put his
finger over the tip

JACK (CONTD)
Do it Like this I wont shoot
Dont you trust me

RL
You wont do anything

RL smiles He puts his finger over the muzzle Jack
hesitates Then he pulls the trigger

RL howls in pain and consternation looks at his brother
then runs back to the house

Jack issick at heart It could not have been he who acted in
this way Something acted on him But no he did it though a
strange he not the real he

A new pain enters his Soul one that his mothers touch
cannot take away

INT OBRIEN HOUSE - LATER

RL does not look at him Never again will he get back to that
garden where their spirits mingled as one He has trampled on
all that is dear

JACK
I got told on

Even Steve is wary of him

TIGHT ON HIS MOTHER

JACK
It was an accident
MOTHER
No it wasnt What got into you
He wants to’ confess -- all but those sins he feels ashamed
of

You always loved him more
She will not be put off

Jack gives RL the thunder egg he treasured RL is delighted
He bounces on the bed

EXT FRONT YARD

Jack walks out across the front yard and stands under the oak
tree He is lost to what he was but he has found something
new

INT LIVING ROOM
Some days later Jack joins his parents in the living room

FATHER
Come in here We want to speak with
you Sit down

(he does)
We never finished college neither
I nor your mother We want you to
have the best education So weve
decided -- were sending you off to
school

He turns accusingly to his mother She looks away She does
not wish it But he has been fighting so much with his
father it might be the only way to save him from
destruction

FATHER (CONTD)
Well still see you on vacation
Its just a hundred miles away you
know A good school Ive spoken
with the people there They know
what a good boy you are But if
were going to do this then you
will work Your brothers --

Jack leaps up and rushes out of the house
EXT YARD AND WOODS

His chest heaves with violent emotjons5The trees the
familiar houses offer no consolation now

EXT NEW HOUSE GOING UP

RL leads Jack to a new house that is just going up at the end
of the block They slip like ghosts among the sweet-smelling
studs and wander through the rooms looking for slugs by the
electrical boxes RL looks at him and smiles

Robert appears A moment later RL is crying

RL
He stole my slugs

Jack gives him the slugs that he himself has found Then --
EXT ROBERTS HOUSE

He marches over o Roberts house and punches him in the
nose knocking him o the ground

LATER
His mother speaks with him alone

MOTHER

I think this will be for the best
Youve been having so much trouble
with your father -- I know you love
him -- and with your classmates at
school I - we -- think it might
be better than the school here --
better for you I mean We havent
been good parents or you wouldnt
be under all this tension We
should have set you a better
example I will miss you very much

Dimly he senses that she does not want this separation --
that she is doing something that is very hard for her

She looks at him The child she expects to have the most
trouble with At last she must give him into the worlds
hands

EXT CARPORT

One afternoon Mr OBrien returns home early He asks no
questions of the boys He does not demand to know if they
have practiced the piano or weeded the beds His eyes do not
meet theirs It is the middle of a weekday It is strange to
the boys that he is home at all

FATHER 2
Go play for a whilewill yous 1
want to speak to your othec lone

Inwardly he seems to stagger
INT LIVING ROOM

He sits down in a corner and gazes out the window His life
now seems to him a folly The world a fraud But he might
still have them -- his family -- whom he took for granted

Jack hears a muffled cry At first it seems they might be
having another fight But this is a new unfamiliar sound a
moan Jack stands in the hall listens

FATHER (0S)
Theyre closing the plant I can
either stcikKe out on my own or
stay with rhe company and take
whatever Job they offer me They
expect me to beg

MOTHER (08 )
Im sorry

FATHER (0S)

We have to think of the kids Dont
tell them what happened i dont
want them to worry

Moved at the sight of his shame and dismay she touches his
cheek consoling him Jack watches through a crack in the
door Mr OBrien trembles with a sense of wonder and
discovery

FATHER (CONTD)

Im not the man I thought I was
Ive driven my sons away from me I
thought I was making them - tough
-- so they could live in the world
-- so they could get ahead -- go
farther I treated them with

malice

Jack sees RL has come up behind him in the hall

It was my fault I believed in the
company What I should have done
was take my life into my own hands
Now Im low In the mud The
strange thing is - I feel free

(taking her hands)

Thank you for loving me

NEW ANGLE

Jack looks at his mother and father He waits for an
explanation He never before has seen him shaken and
bewildered

RL
What is it

FATHER
I lost my job They want to --
transfer me They dont understand
the business There are ups and
downs Everyone knows hat --

Jacks heart opens towards him

FATHER (CONTD)
Do you understand You can You

badly -- Ive not only lost the
light myself but the power to give
it to you -- my children Ive
given you my darkness instead And
it will take you years to find your
way out of it I wanted to be
strong A man you could love --

He looks at them He sees how much he needs them more than
the success he craved more than wealth or prestige

FATHER (CONTD)
Gan you love me

(aerec a pause)
Im more like you than her

FATHER
No youre not I can make up for

be drawing closer and closer to the eternal

the eyes of his soul Even sorrow Was brovant him good

Fields forests tall mountains the world is restored to its
original beauty His soul has emerged from childhood He

tree some rocks a dead minnow a coin and a playing card

EXT NEIGHBORHOOD

Jack casts a last lingering look at the neighbors houses
He will never live here again This part of his life is over
But now that music comes back which he once heard in the
woods then ceased to hear an answering voice

JACKS POVS ON FATHER

Mr OBrien is back at his old wou Formenting them with
scoldings and arbitrary orders Vlas he Foca even his great

Jack comes up beside RU and takes his hand Bending forward

UP ANGLE ON MOTHER - MUSIC A FANFARE

Mrs OBrien sees this smiles She ‘takes Jack by the hand
and together they go off the world before them now

POVS FROM MOVING CAR

They are pulling away when Shep appears They almost forgot
him He wags his tail as he jumps in the car

The streets of Waco recede behind them

EXT HIGHWAY —- GULLIED FIELDS — ROAD AHEAD - MUSIC

A rainbow spreads above the horizon as they set out toward
the east onto the cold plain of the world

They pass a highway crew men toiling by the sweat of their
brows Civilization appears tall buildings public works

Jack gazes at the road ahead hopeful expectant
PART THREE
EXT CITY - JACK (ADULT) - THE FUTURE

Jack an adult now wakes up from his revesie His soul has
come to life He sees the order oF Xnin o1 Fe sanity of the
creative scheme a moral purpose Underlyiarg

Now before his eyes the future vunbolds
THE WORLD IN RUINS -— THE GREAT TRIBULATION

Scenes from the Congo from Bangladesh Iraq and Chad
Children stranded by a flood their mute inquiring eyes
Dry abandoned wells Riots fires Grief and dread have
seized the earth

EXT NEW EARTH —- THE FAMILY OF MAN

The music shifts to a major key The C minor of the chaos
section is resolved into a triumphant E flat major as after
the great Catastrophe a new earth appears a new land of the
spirit

Evil is overcome wrona 1S set right Men lay down their
arms Manacles are wadoneg Bolts and locks fly open Black
embraces white Myshm Jew Man recovers his lost
inheritance The sev ig reconciled with nature

Women from Guatemala India Kenya Greenland they smile at
their children Scenes of peace and harmony from the
Dordogne from Bhutan and Switzerland and other happy lands
where the earth is still a garden

THE END OF THE EARTH (CGI) BLACK SKY - MUSIC

The last days of the earth Man has long since left its
surface to seek asylum on worlds yet unknown The atmosphere
has vanished The seas have boiled away The land melts Lava
streams down the naked hills

Trumpets sound as the sun swells outward spewing its last
reserves of energy into the night-of space

The earth skims through an envelope of luminous white gas in
eventless rounds

THE DYING SUN (CGI) - PLANETARY NEBULA - TENDER MUSIC

The dying sun collapses to a fraction of its former size a
white dwarf now

All mans sacrifices his work his suffering and genius are
gone without a trace Nothing seems the better or worse for
it nothing improved or diminished He was here one day
swept away the next

The sun torn from its axis drifts herovon “space without
purpose or direction an undistinguished cfadec glowing with
a faint blue light no brighter wan todays full moon

Behind it like a lost child trails a tenant of the earth
NEW WORLDS IMAGINARY LIFE (CGI) - PANDROMEDA

New worlds spring up from the ashes of the old New suns
with new planets in their spheres Numberless galaxies ina
universe without center or circumference

As the universe grows older life assumes new forms It runs
like a fire to the uttermost reaches of space and time --
breaks free of its confinement to mortal flesh -- resolves
itself into the unbounded and ethereal -- into spirit light

DEGENERATE ERA (CGI) - A THOUSAND TRILLION YEARS FROM NOW -
LAST WORLDS PERSHNG— DEATH OF THE UNIVERSE - END OF TIME

At length these new worlds pesish like those which preceded
them Their mountains bucn Like tar Their suns go out like
candles in the wind Stars are scattered like chaff and the
heavens roll up Ke q Secoll «

The expansion of the universe accelerates The galaxies
recede out of sight of each other All but those in our local
group become invisible Gradually as they run out of
hydrogen star formation ceases Only brown and white dwarfs
remain with neutron stars black holes atoms the size of
the Milky Way and other bizarre products of this era With
each passing year they drift farther and farther apart from
each other

Night sinks into a deeper night Now and then there is a
burst of light as two dwarfs collide to form a new star

When there is nothing left to devour the black holes
themselves evaporate away
All dies even death itself Time comes to a close and all
is as it was in the beginning

Shall the creation leave off here Has death no purpose
great as lifes

The same triumphant music accompanies the departure of these
celestial scenes as greeted their arrival at the start of our
story when the stars were first born A hymn of joy

Though all that lives is doomed to die something yet
remains Though even our universe is not eternal there yet
is that which is

THE MULTIVERSE (CGI) —- MULTIPLE QIG BANGS THIRD EXPANSION

From the sadness and gloom of the las’ alaht new universes
burst forth one rising out of the okher a fountain of
Light

Creation is eternal birth A beginning without end It
happens in every instant of time

The same power which burns in the stars and nebulae burns
equally in us Our being is a miracle equal with the
creation of the universe and like the universe each day is
created anew

For a third time the cosmos expands Universes froth and
dance like bubbles in a pot of boiling water Most contain no
life -- unstable seas of neutrinos photons and electrons
incapable of combinin to form any higher structure -- but
what can we say of rhe countless others

We have ceviewedte whel ‘of time in order that we might
see what is wiMoovt be wae) or end -- without growth
without decay -- eternity evealing itself in the phenomena
of time -- as active in “andoing as in doing

TIGHT on JACK -— DAWN

The first shafts of dawn reach into the city of desolation
EXT CITY - CROSSROADS - DAWN

Jack finds himself at the edge of the city A choice is
offered him he may either go back into the Labyrinth where
he wandered so long or come out into the unknown and
unfamiliar

EXT WALL RAMPS DOOR - REIMERS RANCH SET -— DAWN

He sees a ramp a ladder a gateway a door

Gathering his courage he goes forward The door is ajar He
stands at the threshold There is no sound of life only the ©
wind What lies on the other side Does he dare to see

One step and he is through
EXT FIELD BEYOND THE WALL SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC

He stands in a field beyond the wall which already seems to
lie far behind him He hears the singing of cicadas The land
‘is dry He looks for water He will not find it here

EXT SLOT CANYON - GOBLIN VALLEY - SLICKROCK (UTAH) WITH TIME
LAPSE OF FLOWING WATER CLOUDS - CLIMB

He passes through the narrow defile of aslo canyon His
heart pounds with dread He climbs Anco ere rock

He sees a coral snake on the ground Twis and other images
from his past gradually take shape -- assume a sense they did
not have before At last he begins to understand the meaning
and the pattern of his life Everything seems a clue an
oracle the nighthawk overhead the rising moon the faint
sound of a guitar

EXT STREAM POOL AMONG PETRIFIED DUNES - DAWN

A stream runs through the rock He approaches it A canyon
wren is singing He kneels down beside the water He drinks
from it He bathes hisface and neck

We have traveled up thea river of time -- ascended from
nature to the Sov

Paradise is nota elace neve or there The soul is paradise
it opens before us here today The humblest things show it
We live in the eternal even now

EXT SUNFLOWER FIELD

Sunflowers their heads turned towards their source the
unseen sun illuminating all with its bright shafts pressing
eagerly through chinks and cracks driving the darkness
before it --

EXT LAND OF THE DEAD — MIST - DUST -— CAVESEACITYQUARRY -
UTAH SALT FLATS - MONO LAKE — GRASSLAND -— BOMARZO -— DAWN

Dawn tints the high clouds as a fresh wind finds its way into
the land of death at the end of that road from which there
is no return where men sit in darkness where dust is their
food

The mists dissolve away Light breaks through a high window
awakening the dead The sleepers open their eyes look about
They rise up exultant changed -- fresh as they were in the
days of their youth

They gather from different places -- all who have ever lived
They ascend towards the light at the mouth of a cave They
come out of the city streets where they last walked -- out of

quarries and abandoned factories and up from the depths of
the sea

Their faces are covered with ash Each wears that costume
which indicates his character or occupation while he was
alive a ball gown a cassock amilirasm uniform or simply
his Sunday best One drags a chain anokher pushes a large
ball Gradually as though at the close of masquerade they
put these disguises aside

They stop by a pool to wash their faces Their features grow
more distinct

They wander over a salt flat At first the ground is dry and
cracked Then with a mounting excitement they discover
water beneath their feet Ahead lies a mountain Rain clouds
stand above its peak

Shoots of young grass spring up through the hard ground
EXT SAND DUNES - REUNION AND REBIRTH

Men and women embrace in the dawn reunited at last Husband
and wife mother and child greet each other in joy and awe
Eagerly they tell each other all that has happened The ages
since they last saw cacy oWe have passed off like a dream
Here there is no before of after

EXT SHORE OF ETERWIVTY- MUSIC OF UNBOUNDED JOY

They go down toward the shore entranced by a growing
brightness in the east They speak with each other in
whispers

The shore teems with people now Water laps at their feet A
crown lies cast down on the wet sand Mrs Stone finds her
son Mrs McKeever her husband Jack sees other figures from
his past Mr Reese 0C his grandmother and his uncle
Betty and Ruth Cayler and others the prisoner the lame
man Marsha and Robert It is as though they were coming
together in one great chorus

This is the end of the voyage of life The music sings all
came from love to love all shall return

Jack has crossed over deaths threshold gone beyond’ space
and time to some greater life which includes death within
it

HIS BROTHER

Now from a distance he hears that sweet voice which he
trusts most in all the world

JACK
Brother

As RL approaches Jack reaches out and takes his hand We see
him from the back never face on

JACK (CONTD)
Ive found you

They meit into each others arms Here 1A the eternal they
have not been apart

The walls of the world fly away It can hold them no longer
They know each other in that which is without end

MOTHER AND FATHER

Turning Jack sees his mother father and Steve looking on
He leads RL towards them

MOTHER
‘Is it you

RL wipes the eaCS From her eyes

MOTHER (CONTD)
You

She embraces her lost sen She touches his hands his face
ecstatic Wonder Unspeakable joy

FATHER
My son

Now with open arms his father comes towards him Love
unites what death and suffering have put asunder He turns
to his wife She caresses her childs hair She looks at the
strangers who are standing by as though to ask if she is
dreaming She looks at Jack She nods Her grief is cured
Her doubts are ended

JACK (0S)
What you are cant die

The plain and ordinary has become a door to the infinite He
lives in that which neither comes into being nor passes away

He takes his mothers hands The music drops away He knows
love and not its semblance The world itself is music now

ETERNITY
Dawn approaches

We pass beyond death We arrive at the eternal the real --
at that which neither flowers nor fades which neither comes
into being nor passes away -- that in which we might live
forever Hitherto all has been Mere Mage all that we think
solid and permanent Space time enaneScent all images
only the purpose and last end gsewhete tne life of life

Eternity -- that realm of pure and endless iqht -- how shall
we represent it A ladder leading up into a tree Sparks
flying up from a fire A bridge A kiss A solitary island

A single image might serve better than several combined The
whole creation in the figure of a tree The smallest leaf
communicates with the lowest root all parts feeding on the
same sap breathing in the same air and sunlight drawing the
same life up from the darkness of the earth below

Simple images captured with a pinhole camera After the
nervous movements of time we see that of which time is a
moving picture

“A child the similant4 in form between the shape of his ear
and that of an eustes shel between the cowlick at the crown
of his head anda golowu A lotus its stalk rising clear of
the water its jeatowhich nothing clings Sequoias A
rose unfolding Life surpassing itself

A locomotive approaches the end of a tunnel The light draws
closer Soon it shall burst out into the day No longer a
blind mechanism it has become (quick dissolves quick cuts)
a river -- living flowing -- the pure waters of the river of
life rushing down from a mountain peak

Winter has passed The leafless woods our hero wandered in
are green and cool murmurous with the song of birds

You separate the true from the false You to whom all things
return from whom all proceed in whom they are the
beginning of things and their last end the goal of each and
all

The whole of the picture has been a sifting The chaff flies
away the kernel remains Something lives in you that shall
outlast the stars

EXT SHORE

As Jack watches his mother spreads her arms towards her
children restored to faith and happiness reconciled to
life

Now he sees that it was she -- his mysterious guide the
guardian of his heart the source of his moral being She is
the mother of all creation All flows out of her she is the
gateway the door She smiles Arough a things

Through her the eternal sought him Fcom ovt of her mouth it
spoke Through her life and actions she beovant them near it

MOTHER Fear no longer You shall find me

The camera rises with the musics circling strings - over
the trees over the hills and plains Now there is rest The
peace of eternity spreads about him and all is as it was in
the beginning

EXT CITY

Rain Weeds in the cracks of a sidewalk Children playing We
are back with Jack in the city Even in these streets the
eternal shines This is Gods world and not an infinite
plain of chaos and soccow after all

Though he must linae™ here a while yet he will not despair
A new life lies before Whim A faith which sees through death

MOTHER (0S)
Know hat I am

EXT OBRIEN HOUSE

We return to the present to the noise and confusion of the
everyday to the place we set out from We see it now as
though for the first time What seemed plain and familiar
glows with a radiance it did not display before We have
found the infinite in the everyday the commonplace

Jack looks about Will the revelation be forgotten Will it
seem a passing fancy -- a dream

Inside the house his father is playing the piano His mother
has gone into the backyard A bell sounds

The great oak tree stands like a sentient being —-
thoughtful benevolent -- looking down on him

He puts his ear against the trunk and listens for those words
that it was foretold would destroy the evil in mens hearts
and bring them good

The camera rises up through the branches cranes up and up
until it breaks out of the canopy of leaves into the sky
above

All ends in peace as music does The last chord melts into
ordinary production sound Time has reappeared resumed its
sway

And still the vision is not the Joveneny Tue real journey has
yet to begin

Will he give himself to this new life Qo0e he dare
A stranger smiling

A threshold

A star

THE END
