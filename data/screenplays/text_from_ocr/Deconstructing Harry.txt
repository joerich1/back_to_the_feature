DECONSTRUCTING HARRY
EXT NORMAN AND LESLIE’S COUNTRY HOUSE - DAY i
OPEN at the country house

Ideal location would be a few acres with a pond and
a house with picture windows so one can be inside
and have a nice view of the front lawn that leads
quickly to the pond or small lake

Some folks are barbecuing down by the water’s edge
and we pick up general ad-libbing Stuff like
Who wants chicken and who wants hot dogs

Be careful -- did you put on sun block
It’s smoking don’t put so much fluid on
Etc

LESLIE

(ad-lib a pretty blonde

in her late twenties or

early to mid to late

thirties the hostess)
I can’t get the fire started

NORMAN
(her husband a doctor)
Let me

LESLIE
Norman’s the barbecuer in this
family I can only cook indoors over
a good stove and then only pasta

The conversation is basically ad-lib to clarify the
relationships for the audience and should overlap
and run together not sticking religiously to my
words

NORMAN
(he says to his sister-in-
law Janet who is a year
or two older than Leslie)
I’m always afraid your sister will
burn down the house and start a major
forest fire

JANET
Dad you want chicken or meat

JANET’S DAD
(sitting in lounge chair
with magazine)
Chicken is fine This is a brilliant
article

Leslie goes toward house

JANET’S MOM

such a head start

JANET

More adlibbing as the barbecue flairs

sighs appropriately -- then suddenly

JANET

simultaneously

LESLIE

life’s over

KEN

LESLIE
Careful
(knocks over something
as she gets pants off)

KEN
Hurry Oh -- Oh

They go to that position wherein he can penetrate
her and see out at the same time They do it and
observe the others simultaneously

LESLIE
Oh that feels so good - my god
look at Norman - wouldn’t you know
he’d have a chef’s hat on
KEN
(screwing her)
That’s what you get for marrying a
country doctor

LESLIE
I’m Madame Bovary

KEN
You’re wasted in Connecticut

LESLIE
The schools are so much cheaper
Oh oh that’s great Oh god I
feel so guilty towards Janet -- I
love my sister I love her dearly
we’ve always been so close -- harder
harder fuck me harder -- she’s such
a wonderful girl --

KEN
(sweating)

If only I’d met you first -- life
would be so much simpler

LESLIE
Oh -- your after-shave smells so
great

KEN

It’s insect repellent I hate the
god-damn country

LESLIE
Oh oh -- OK -- you can come any
time you want to now
KEN

Suddenly Grandma enters surprising them She’s
totally blind

GRANDMA

They are frozen in their intercourse position and
she speaks to them never knowing

LESLIE

GRANDMA
Oh Ken -- hello -- I was telling
Leslie - first I lose an eye because
of a detached retina -- then in my

one good eye my nerve degenerates --

KEN
(trying to finish)
Ohh oh ohhh
GRANDMA
Well it’s not that bad don’t
moan over it - I don’t but be

thankful you’re still young
Ken keeps up the sex

GRANDMA
Not that you have a better world --
with the drugs and the handguns --
every sixteen year old kid they have
to frisk metal detectors in the
public schools -- and the streets are
lined with the homeless - beggars
like in Calcutta -- with the coffee
cups jingling -- you pause in your
car at a stop light and someone
washes your windshield with a
squeegee whether you want him to or
not - y’know what I mean

KEN
(finally finishing)
Yes Yes
GRANDMA
I knew you’d agree you’re an
intellectual
EXT WEST VILLAGE - STREET - NIGHT

Taxi pulls up on a residential street a woman
nervously exits She’s distraught

She bears a vague resemblance to Leslie Same age

build same hair style perhaps she’s a brunette or
some similar dressing habit of style or maybe they
both wear glasses or nervously smoke Depends on
casting

As cab pulls away we see the woman either in her
purse or pocket has a small pistol She’s tense

She finds the brownstone she’s looking for rings

Lucy
You shmuck You bastard I’d like

HARRY
You seem upset God it’s been a
long time --

LUCY
How could you do that Didn’t you
know what would happen

HARRY
Lucy

Don’t answer me you prick You knew
-- you just didn’t give a shit
il

HARRY
Can I take your coat

LUCY
How could you write that book Why
Are you so selfish You’re so self
involved you don’t give a shit who
you destroy

HARRY
Lucy I’ve had a rough few years

LUCY
You told our whole story All the
details You gave me away to my
sister - Marvin’s left me -- he’s
gone --

HARRY
It was loosely based on us --

Lucy
Don’t bullshit me you motherfucker
Who do you think you’re talking to
One of those retarded talk show
hosts I lived through it with you
-- I know how loosely based it is

HARRY
It’s full of wild comic distortions
Your blind grandmother never caught
us fucking

Lucy
Of course you made a few stupid
exaggerations or as the critics say
inspired comic flights -- But Jane
recognized it - anyone would have to
be sub-mental not to - and Marvin
was crushed -- crushed

HARRY
Jane suspected us long before --

LUCY
Yes you shmuck And I denied it --
now you confirmed everything for her
- big fucking deal - so you made
Leslie a blonde and I’m a brunette --
big fucking deal - but it’s all

LUCY

doctor the violinist her younger
sister in Connecticut cheating with
her husband the picture window --
cruel condescending observations
about Marvin and his barbecue and
chef‘’s hat -- and Jane - or as you
pathetically disguise her -- Janet

(reads from book)
It was not simply that Leslie had
become numbed with the inane spate of
leaden perceptions that passed for
wit from Marvin It was not even the
image she shared wickedly with Ken of
Marvin’s flaccid microscopic member
jiggling up and down as he bounced
naked on tip toes across the rugless
icy floor of their Connecticut home
to close the storm windows It was
that she had never loved him but
wanted to have children to retaliate
against her older sister who did not
have a maternal bone in her being and
whose every inch Leslie felt was
occupied by gluttonous self-love
Ken ran his hand over Leslie’s long
silky hair and mounted her from the
rear Big fucking deal -- you gave
her long hair

HARRY
Leslie --

LUCY
Lucy -- I’m Lucy motherfucker -- I’m
not Leslie - except of course I’m
Leslie because you made no effort to
disguise anything -- you didn’t give

a fuck You didn’t care enough to
disguise it

HARRY
Please
Lucy
You pulled out two years ago -- you

broke my fucking heart -- you dumped
your wife and me for some little
cooze me and Janet

HARRY
Jane Janet’s the character

Lucy
Now - two years later your latest
magnum opus emerges out of this sewer
of an apartment -- where you take
everybody’s suffering and transmute
it into gold -- into literary gold --
other people’s misery -- you even
cause their misery and mix your
fucking alchemy and make it into gold
- like a fucking black magician

HARRY
I’m the one who wound up in Bellevue

LUCY
You deserve it and worse
(takes out gun)

HARRY
What’s that

LUCY
What does it look like

HARRY
Lucy --

LUCY

You ruined my life I came here to
blow my brains out

HARRY
You drove two hours
Lucy
In front of you -- because you caused

it On your carpet My fucking
brains on your carpet

HARRY
Oh god -- are you unstable

Lucy
That’s what turned you on about me
wasn’t it That’s why you picked me
to have an affair with Jane’s crazy
sister

HARRY
You’re not gonna kill yourself

LUCY
I’m not
HARRY
It’s too dramatic It’s a fantasy
Youre not the theatrical one -- Jane

is the solo violinist

Lucy
You‘re right I’m the suburban mouse
- the wife of the country doctor --

HARRY
Put down the gun

LUCY
You’re right -- I don’t have the
nerve to kill myself -- I knew it on
the way over - I said no not me --
better to kill him -- kill the black
magician -- so he won’t spin anymore

gold from human grief

HARRY
Lucy --

Lucy

Shut up You’re so fucking verbal
Who else could have talked me into
giving him a blow job at my father’s
funeral

She fires misses he runs out

INT HARRY’S APTFIRE STAIRS - NIGHT

Harry runs up stairs she follows

EXT HARRY’S APTROOF - NIGHT

Lucy stalks him on the roof

HARRY
(as she comes upon him)
Lucy please -- look if it makes
you feel any better I’m a mess My
life has gone wrong - I’ve blown all
my chances for any kind of decent
life - my girl has left me -- gone

off with my friend -- my old
university is honoring me tomorrow
I have no one to share it with I’m
making the drive alone -- I’m tapped
out --

LucY
You got your fucking gold your
dollars from the pain of my life and
Jane’s and Marvin’s and my kids -

HARRY
I don’t do it for the money

LUCY
No why do you do it

HARRY
Look we’re not talking about a
bestseller here - we’re talking
maybe six thousand copies sold -- the
Times review was mixed - basically
negative -- the truth is I am broke
-- I got an advance on a new book and
I pissed it away -- I’ve squandered

every last cent I have on lawyers and
shrinks and whores I’m paying
alimony to two ex-wives child
support -- my drinking is killing
me I’ve got herpes and chronic
insomnia and reflux and chronic
fatigue syndrome Look I can’t
stand here on the fucking roof
pleading for my life with a world
class meshugena cunt -- if you’re
gonna kill me kill me I was in the
middle of writing when you
interrupted

LUCY
Whose life were you exploiting today

HARRY
If you must know it was me Now
that I’ve turned fifty they’re
collecting some of my short stories
and I was just cleaning up an early
autobiographical one about me when I
was a kid when I was first married

So I havent heard from Lucy in two
years Now Im on the roof with her
and shes pointing a gun at me and I
start talking -- Im talking for my
life -- Im describing a short story
(MORE)

HARRY
about when I was a kid and first
married -- and she found it funny and
gradually she calmed down

DR JAKS
Your choices in women leaves some-
thing to be desired

HARRY
But the interesting thing that struck
me about my short story apart from
the obvious sexual guilt was how
little I’ve changed over the years
At twenty one I had a shrink now I’m
much older -- I’m here six shrinks
three wives - I still love whores I
love ‘em -- I’ve always loved ‘em --
I still fantasize about fucking every
woman I meet or read about -- every
size age shape - I was given a
ticket for parking in a hospital zone
-- I tried to get a blow job from the
meter maid -- I wound up with a ten
thousand dollar fine for attempted
bribery It’s like I never grew up
I mean I see men my age in
responsible positions with families
do they go around plagued by
erotic thoughts -- my God did Raul
Wallenberg try and bang every
cocktail waitress he met

DR JAKS
Tell me about your honoring ceremony
tomorrow

HARRY
It’s all bullshit

DR JAKS
Are you really being honest with
yourself

HARRY
It does have a certain vengeful irony
if only because the same university
threw me out many years ago

DR JAKS
Why

HARRY
Bad marks I had no interest I was
already married I wanted to write

DR JAKS
But times change and now they’re
proud you’re an alumnus

HARRY
I still have to drive all the way up
there alone I asked Lucy if she
wanted to come she just gave me a
look

DR JAKS
What about your idea to take your son
up with you

HARRY
I don’t have time this week I have
him next week Joan has him this
week and she’s so inflexible

DR JAKS
Y’mean you can’t trade dates with
her

HARRY
I can’t even reach her She only
appears in my dreams -- hostile of

course Y’know lately I’ve been
having the oddest dreams and thoughts
- last week my long dead father
appeared in my dream again and
arrested me for killing my mother --
talk about waking up in a cold sweat
-- I don’t know - is my life
catching up with me Too much booze

You see my point The central
character is an artist -- and also an
actor -- someone who is always
’ putting on a performance -

HARRY
(defensively)
Who am I performing for

DR JAKS

And despite the fact the children

don’t want to wear glasses - they’re
forced to -- you expect the outside

world to adjust to the distortion
you’ve become

HARRY
Now wait --

DR JAKS
But the hour’s over Have a nice
time at your honoring ceremony and I
do think it would be good for both
you and your son if you could bring

There are numerous parents and kids Throughout the
conversation between Hilly and Harry another mother
cant help but overhear Perhaps they are all in
the play yard

HILLY
Dad why doesnt my penis look like
yours
HARRY

When I was a boy we always named our
penises Mine was called Excalibur

-- my friend called his Golden Lance
- there was one kid in the neighbor-
hood I didnt trust -- he called his

penis Beverly

HILLY
But why does mine look different than
yours
HARRY
Because we didnt have you
circumcised
HILLY
I think Ill name mine Dillinger
HARRY
Great name -- there was an exciting
guy -- no nine to five desk clerk
He robbed banks - like Willie Sutton

Throughout the supervisor doesnt approve

Revised 82396 -- Pink 33

HARRY
Only the most creative bank robber
ever Hilly some men are just
artists -- they have the creative
touch Willie Sutton would get to the
bank early before they opened hed
go right in with the workers pull his

gun --
HILLY
Did he go to jail
HARRY
He did But he made a choice
Willie Sutton said - Im going to

lead a life of existential risk --
remember I taught you that big word
Some men would rather spend their

lives as burglars slaves in an jorea lina sto

office -- the only drawback Hilly homes “bler dar

is it is night work aud Stealing jew
HILLY rather thou (ne

Sounds great

HARRY
You bet it is Because what you
choose for a lifes work is very
important Freud -- I told you about
Freud - the brain -- psychology --
Freud said the two key things for a
fulfilling life are work and sex

HILLY

SCHOOL MOTHER
I wouldnt want my son to hear an
adult extolling crime and criminals
HARRY
What do you teach your son

SCHOOL MOTHER
Appropriate family values I happen to
be quite friendly with Hilly’s mother
and I think she’d like to know her
son was exposed to that kind of talk

HARRY
I stole as a child Not that I
needed to steal - it was for the
pure aesthetics of the crime -- you
admit there could be something
exhilarating about breaking the
law -- as long as you don’t harm
anyone

SCHOOL MOTHER
I wouldn’t brag about a sociopathic
personality

HARRY
I stole my high school teachers
diaphragm -- risky -- because she was
wearing it at the time

SCHOOL MOTHER
I’ve read your ideas on sex and I’m
sorry but I must say -- I don’t find
them amusing as an adult and to a
growing boy --

HARRY
Hilly and I are very open with each
other You do think it should be my
choice rather than yours as to how to
raise my child

SCHOOL MOTHER
That’s up to his mother

HARRY
I guess you and she will be speaking

SCHOOL MOTHER
We speak often She’s a wonderful
woman

HARRY
OK let me ask you you brought up
family values - are you a religious

woman

SCHOOL MOTHER
That’s my business

HARRY
I’m just curious because what I’m
going to suggest will sound forward
but you’re a very attractive woman
despite your rigid ideas and I
promise I would use a condom -- so
there’s no need to worry --

SCHOOL MOTHER
If you’ll excuse me - I’m going to
speak to the principal

HARRY
Don’t get upset -- my question was
only -- are you a religious woman

and does your particular persuasion
have a flexible attitude toward anal

intercourse -- that’s with a
condom --

resuming their original conversation

JOAN
Beth Kramer was never so appalled in
her life

HARRY
She’s a tight-assed aggressive cunt
busybody -- and it’s none of her
fucking business how I choose to
converse with my son

JOAN
She’s a responsible parent and a good
friend

HARRY

Hey look I don’t want to fight
What am I asking you To switch
visitation dates To let Hilly come
with me for a lousy day to see his
father get honored at a university
It‘ll be a nice memory for the kid

JOAN
I’m sorry he can’t take a day off
from school

HARRY
Why not It’s a snotty little
private school with rich dopey kids
where he learns little of value like
how to bake pretzels or life in an
ant farm

JOAN
This is where I came in

HARRY
What would you do if he was sick
He’d have to miss school

JOAN
If he was sick he’d stay home but
he’s not missing a day to spend it
with his alcoholic pill popping
excuse for a father

HARRY
My God - you didn’t always think of
me like that - you were a free

spirit at one time --

did

years - she’s sixty now

vulnerable after the death of a loved
one

to fuck you at her husband’s burial

Don’t
FAY
Harry please --
HARRY
I love you
FAY

Weve been through this

HARRY
You’re who I love I can’t help it
With you everything is clear and
simple

FAY
We both agreed from the start it was
never going to become too involved
Those were your ground rules

HARRY
Yes but who knew I’d fall in love

FAY
Don’t think I’m not grateful The
last year together was the most
important of my life

HARRY
Who is it Larry

FAY
You know it is

HARRY
I did know it This guy comes in and
stole you out from under my very nose
- he’s the devil - whenever he
shows up I smell burning sulfur

FAY
He’s your friend

HARRY
Was - was -- he’s the devil

FAY
Can we have your blessing Can I
have it

HARRY
No You were the only real thing in
my life -- ever

FAY

It was tutorial I was your pupil
It was Henry Higgins and Eliza
Doolittle -- That’s what you loved

HARRY
No Henry Higgins falls in love with
her That’s what happened

FAY
Why did you fall in love with me
You gave me those endless lectures on
love in the Western World Denis
DeRougement the Tristan myth
unrequited love is the only love that
endures -- All those warnings to me
that I would probably fall in love
with you but don’t because you were
only a father figure

HARRY
And in the end I fell in love with
you The whole thing is too
infuriating for words

FAY
How did I become so important to you

HARRY
I didn’t think I could love anybody
-- I thought I was too damaged --
like a woman who can’t have an orgasm
- and then one day I woke up and
looked at you over breakfast and it
hit me -- oh this is what they talk
about I see it now -- and then we
had dinner with Larry and his date
and I thought I smelled burning
sulfur

FAY
That you could get so entangled with
just -- a fan

HARRY
Yes - a fan -- a schlemeil kid with
literary aspirations who worships my
writing -- I figured I’d treat you
like any other pretty fan who makes a
fuss over my books I’d fuck you
and go on to the next fan but you
hit some nerve -- You were a fan a
follower then a bed partner then a
pupil then a roommate then suddenly
you were the one controlling the
channel-changer

FAY
When did all this come over you We
lived together for ten months

HARRY
I knew something was up when you
disappeared that morning and I had a
total nervous breakdown

FAY
I handled it badly My note was
stupid it was cold -- I was mixed
up -

HARRY

You had Larry on your mind

FAY
I acted immaturely But you overreacted

HARRY
Hey what’s forty sleeping pills
With some Evian

FAY
I loved you I was in awe of you
But I wasn’t in love with you

HARRY
I’m sorry to say the Prozac did not
help Actually my theory is that the
Prozac made me more suicidal The

lithium however does work -- the
constant blood tests are a pain in
the ass --

FAY

Your drinking’s gotten worse And
with all those drugs

HARRY
If you can’t marry me will you at
least drive upstate with me tomorrow
I’m being honored at Adair Hard to
believe

FAY
I’m getting married tomorrow

HARRY
You’re getting married the same day
I’m being honored -- if there is a
god he’s nasty

disguised You gave me a little more
maturity and a different name

You’re saying I know all this about
her

picked her So it wouldn’t work
So you’d never have to give up sport
fucking and self-pity and chronic
dissatisfaction and grow up

is honoring me -- I personally dont
care but itll be nice for Hilly

DORIS
Last time I saw him he was six

HARRY
Listen you dont keep in touch
either

DORIS
Because I know what you think of me

HARRY
You going to start in

DORIS
Am I wrong Its all over your book -
Jewish too Jewish professionally
Jewish -- of course you attributed it
all to your ex-wife Joan but you gave
her all the details of my life --
because you wanted to depict her with
contempt

HARRY
What are you talking about

DORIS
You made your ex a horror in your last
book and to draw a picture of an
unappetizing unsympathetic woman you
used some of her traits but you
caricatured my religious dedication

HARRY
Jesus Doris --

DORIS
Because it always enraged you that I
returned to my roots

Revised 82396 -- Pink
HARRY
What roots You were a bright girl
sharp funny -- you helped get me

through my childhood -- and suddenly

out of left field you vacation in

Fort Lauderdale and marry a fanatic --
and you become obsessed with superstition

DORIS
Its tradition

HARRY
Tradition is the illusion of
permanence

in

DORIS per fe s

You have no values -- rsttnihilism

cynicism sarcasm and orgasm
HARRY ek elected

In France I could xuf-on that slogan

DORIS
Im a Jew I was born a Jew Are
you angry with me because of it

HARRY
And if our parents had converted to
Catholicism a month before you were
born youd have been born a Catholic -
- theyre clubs Doris -- like the
Shriners -- theyre exclusionary --
they all help foster the concept of
the other so you can feel superior
or hate more clearly

DORIS
Enough

HARRY
Do you feel more when a Jew is
massacred than when a Gentile is
massacred Or a black Ora
Bosnian

DORIS
Ido I cant help it I do Its
my people

Why are Jews any issue to you at all

makes sense for a goy in a red suit
called the Pope to tell Mr Reilly
down the hall he cant snap a Trojan
on his dick

DORIS
But in your books its always Jews
Because Burts right about you --
youre a self hating Jew

HARRY
I may hate myself but not because Im
Jewish

DORIS

Why do you hate yourself

HARRY
Because Im not Flaubert

Right because you’re not a goy

You have a one track mind

off my first wife -- don’t ask me why
I never understood it - I mean

lying next to her in bed -- the way
the moonlight hit her -- and I’m not

Lining

Yes -- life is very odd -- I’m glad I

exist only in fiction

HARRY
I was very good to you in a book Amy
- I really painted you into quite a
dish

HELEN

You idealize your women characters
There’s a certain type that permeates
almost all your writing
Betty Harmon in your first book

(she appears as

described)
She’s exotic with big lips an
hypersexual

(another appears now)
Damita in your follow up Very
cultivated -- reads everything
articulate never misses a reference
Also very sexual

(yet another appears)
The actress in your short story about
the jazz musician Gifted easy to
hurt a nymphomaniac

(finally another)

PAUL
And Gloria in Street Smarts --
witty aloof an anti-heroine
ravenous for relations with either
sex

HELEN

the dream woman -- a mirror image of
you but eminently fuckable

satirize so well OK - Larry puts
his art into life -- all right
He’ll never write like you and he
knows it but he lives more fully
See -- I told you it was turgid

HARRY
What does it mean

FAY
Not so intense -- more air space --
not always doing battle -- more joy

I’ve told you all this before
