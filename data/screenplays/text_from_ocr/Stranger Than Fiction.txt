The following appears on screen
“Life is the crummiest book I ever read -- Bad Religion

Godspeed You Black Emperors Lift Your Skinny Fists Like
Antennas To Heaven begins (track 1 on your cd)

FADE IN

Darkness We hear RUSTLING and a small GROAN Then there
is silence for several seconds

As the trumpet comes in the screen is suddenly filled with
the iridescent turquoise blue glow of a wrist watch whose
face plainly reads 715am

It suddenly begins to beep
INT BEDROOM MORNING

The lanky man under the covers reaches out from underneath
his modest blanket and grabs his watch He presses one of
its buttons stopping the beeping

We hear a female NARRATOR speak

NARRATOR (V0)
This is a story about a man named
Harold Crick

He places the watch back on the nightstand

NARRATOR (VO) (CONTD)
--and his wristwatch

Harolds arm retracts back under the covers

NARRATOR (VO) (CONTD)
Harold Crick was a man of infinite
numbers endless calculations and
remarkably few words
(pause)
And his wristwatch said even less

INT BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

HAROLD brushes his teeth in his mint colored bathroom the
door open We see a tiny blue glow from the other room

NARRATOR (V0O)
Every weekday for nine years Harold
would brush each of his 32 teeth 76
times 38 times back and forth 38
times up and down His wristwatch
would simply look on from the
nightstand quietly wishing Harold
would use a more colorful toothbrush

INT CLOSET -- MOMENTS LATER

Harold flips an orange necktie over itself as he looks at
himself getting dressed in his closet mirror his watch now

on His apartment is very clean and modern We may notice

that his only source of time is his watch

NARRATOR (VO)
Every weekday for nine years Harold
would tie his tie in a single Windsor
knot instead of the double thereby
saving him up to 43 seconds every
morning His wristwatch thought the
single Windsor made his neck look
fat but said nothing

EXT STREET CORNER -- MOMENTS LATER

Harold Granny Smith apple between his teeth hurries after

a departing bus while putting on his black overcoat and

carrying a briefcase the cold sleek city jutting out behind

him

NARRATOR (VO)
Every weekday for nine years Harold
would run at a rate of nearly 57
steps per block for 6 blocks nearly
missing the 817 Faraday Bus His
wristwatch would delight in the
feeling of the crisp wind rushing
over its face

Harold is just able to make the bus in time

INT OFFICE LATER

Harold races through the corridors of an expansive office
building occasionally peeking his head into a cubicle or

reviewing the work of one of his peers

HAROLD
handing a folder to
someone )
1412 paragraph 8 Diane Thanks

NARRATOR V0)
And every weekday for nine years
Harold would complete 7134 tax files
as a senior auditor for the Internal
Revenue Service

INT WAREHOUSE DAY

CUT TO

Harold sitting alone at a small steel desk in the corner of
an industrial warehouse eating lunch amongst very tidy stacks

of work

)
NARRATOR (V0O
»only taking a 457 minute lunch
break and 43 minute coffee break
Timed precisely by his wristwatch

He finishes his last bite just before his watch begins to
beep

EXT CITY STREET -- LATER

Harold strolls past small urban shops uptown their colorful
facades and clean windows displaying everything from womens
shoes to travel packages Harold pauses momentarily as he
passes a window displaying various guitars

NARRATOR (V0
Beyond that Harold lived a life of
solitude Harold would walk home
alone

INT KITCHEN -- LATER

Harold finishes eating a modest meal in his pale red kitchen
while looking through a calculator catalog

NARRATOR (V0)
He would eat alone

INT BEDROOM -- LATER

Harold crawls into bed gently removing his wristwatch and
placing it on the nightstand next to him He presses a few
of its buttons probably to set its alarm With a tug of a
chain the yellow light next to him goes out and the room
returns to darkness save for the blue glow of his watch

NARRATOR (V0)

And at precisely 1113 every night
Harold would go to bed alone placing
his wristwatch to rest on the
nightstand beside him

(pause)
That was of course before Wednesday

(pause
On Wednesday Harolds wristwatch
changed everything

The drums explode as we
Blackout

The credits roll and the music continues triumphantly We
find ourselves inter-cutting between two scenes played mute

In one scene a young blonde-haired boy removes his hands
from his eyes revealing a brand new bicycle with a bow on
it His jaw drops He looks at his dad who stares on with
a gleam in his eye

The other scene is of a middle-aged black woman looking
through the employment ads in her cramped kitchen

She holds a red pen over the page hunting for a job for which
shes qualified A view of the paper reveals that she has
circled only one ad

No explanation is given for the scenes as the credits and
music come to an end The following appears on screen

I woke the same as any other day except a voice was in my
head -- Soundgarden

INT NIGHTSTAND -- MORNING

We return to the glow of Harolds wristwatch which reads
715am

It promptly begins beeping

INT BATHROOM - MORNING

Harold is once again brushing his teeth meticulously

NARRATOR (VO)
If one had asked Harold he wouid
have said that Wednesday was exactly
like all the Wednesdays prior And
he began it the same way he--

Harold suddenly stops as does the narration He begins
looking around obviously hearing something He pauses and
listens There’s nothing there He resumes brushing The
narration resumes as well

NARRATOR (VO (CONTD)
And he began it the same way he always
did--

Harold stops again and the narration stops abruptly with
him He definitely hears something He looks at his
toothbrush

HAROLD
Hello

He holds the toothbrush to his ear to listen Nothing He
shakes it Then he holds it stiffly and shakes his head
He resumes brushing and the narration immediately returns

NARRATOR (V0)
He began it the same way he always
did When others’ minds would-

He stops once again now a little worried He puts his
toothbrush down and looks in his shower

HAROLD
Hello Is someone here

Heart racing he looks around but finds no evidence of anyone

else He slowly lifts his toothbrush to his teeth and begins
to carefully brush again

NARRATOR (V0O)
When others minds would fantasize
about their upcoming day or even
try to grip onto the final moments
of their dreams Harold just counted
brush strokes

Harold suddenly stops once more and so does the narration

HAROLD
Alright Who just said “Harold
counted brush strokes --And how

do you know Im counting brush
strokes

(pause)
Hello

He looks at his toothbrush once again He inspects it
Paranoid that somehow the toothbrush might be causing the
voice Harold delicately places it on the edge of the sink
and walks away

INT CLOSET -- MORNING

Harold folds a red tie over itself as he watches himself in
the mirror

NARRATOR (V0)
It was remarkable how the simple
modest-

Harold stops He sighs He looks over both shoulders He
closes his eyes He picks up his tie

NARRATOR (V0) CONTD
It was remarkable how--

He stops again He turns and begins to search his apartment
in the hopes of discovering where the sound is coming from

He looks at his watch He has no choice but to resume getting
dressed He takes his tie in hand

NARRATOR (VO) (CONTD)
it was remarkable how the simple
modest elements of Harolds life so
often taken for granted would become
the catalyst for an entirely new
life

Harold just tries to ignore it
EXT CITY STREET -- MORNING

Harold again runs down the street this time with a pear in
his mouth a red tie knotted in a single Windsor

NARRATOR (V0O)
This was the last dash Harold would
make for the 817 bus the last
morning Harold would hear his breath
(MORB

NARRATOR (VO (CONTD
leap from his throat the last day
his stiff leather shoes would make
that terrible squeaking sound as

- they flexed against the concrete

Harold stops running He looks down at his feet and wiggles
them They squeak against the concrete He wiggles them
again More squeaking He looks up amazed

The bus quickly passes and Harold breaks out of his stupor
to run after it

NARRATOR (V0) (CONTD)
for this was an extraordinary
day ‘A day to be remembered for the
rest of Harolds life

Harold misses the bus and throws his arms up in disgust He
comes to a stop next to a short Polish Woman who also just
missed the bus

NARRATOR (V0) (CONTD)
But of course Harold just thought
it was a Wednesday

Harold grabs the woman by the shoulders

HAROLD
Did you hear that

The woman just stares at him

HAROLD (CONTD)
The the the the voice Did you
hear it- “Harold just thought it
was a Wednesday

POLISH WOMAN
Dont worry It is Wednesday

HAROLD
No Did you hear it Harold just
thought it was a Wednesday

POLISH WOMAN
Whos Harold

HAROLD
I’m Harold

POLISH WOMAN
Harold Its okay It is Wednesday

HAROLD
No I No The voice said it was
just a Wednesday

POLISH WOMAN
Voice is right Its Wednesday

HAROLD
I No ImChrist

The woman looks at him for a second then just walks to the
other side of the bus stop to stand

INT OFFICE - DAY

Harold once again passes through the corridor of the IRS
but he seems distracted almost frazzled stumbling past co-
workers as he reviews a mess of files that nearly topple out
of his amns

NARRATOR (VQ)
Harold couldnt truly concentrate on
his work

FEMALE CO-WORKER
Harold Can you

Harold nearly knocks her over but keeps going Another co
worker approaches
NARRATOR (V0O)
He was lost He struggled to compute
arithmetic he could normally calculate
effortlessly

ANOTHER CO-WORKER
Harold 67 times 453

HAROLD
Uh

He closes his eyes and tries to shake off the voice

HAROLD (CONTD)

Uh

ANOTHER CO-WORKER
Harold

HAROLD

NARRATOR (VQ)
When a co-worker asked the product
of 67 and 453 he drew a blank

HAROLD
(to the voice)

ANOTHER CO-WORKER

HAROLD

Harold realizes what hes just said

HAROLD (CONTD)
Uh nothing Nothing

NARRATOR (V0O)

HAROLD
taking cue

ANOTHER CO-WORKER

The co-worker walks away

NARRATOR (V0)
Despite the answer really being

31305
HAROLD

worker)

o-Wait Wait
INT ARCHIVES -- DAY

Its only midday but already Harold looks ready to go home
His tie is loosened his hair is a mess he looks tired his
papers are scattered and hes just staring at the water cooler
in the archives room a file open in his hand as if frozen

in the middle of filing

A short overweight horribly sweaty co-worker with stains
on his short-sleeved button down shirt (DAVE) comes barreling
past Harold to the water cooler

DAVE
Dude Ive repoed 5 sports cars two
boats and a condo and it’s not even
lunch yet I tell you its a
shame they dont give out an Auditor
of the Year award

Harold just stares forward Dave waits for a response

DAVE (CONTD)
Dude

Harold slowly turns as if waiting for the voice to start
speaking

DAVE (CONTD)
Are you okay

HAROLD
Dave Im being followed

DAVE
(looking around
How are you being followed Youre
not moving

HAROLD

Harold looks up to make sure the voice wont start

HAROLD (CONTD)

(pause )
Its by a voice
DAVE

HAROLD

Im being followed by a womans voice
They just stare at each other for a moment

DAVE
(concerned)
Okay What is she saying

HAROLD
Shes shes narrating

DAVE
Harold Youre standing at the water
cooler What is she narrating

HAROLD
I I I had to stop filing
Watch Listen Listen

Harold continues to organize papers into files

NARRATOR (V0O
The sound the paper made against the
folder had the same tone as a wave
scraping against sand And when
Harold thought about it he listened
to enough waves every day to
constitute what he imagined to be a
deep and endless ocean

Harold stops organizing the papers He turns to Dave

HAROLD
Did you hear that
DAVE
You mean you filing
HAROLD
No The the The voice
DAVE
Nu-huh
HAROLD
Oh God Dave its its its
(pause)

The frightening part is that sometimes
I do imagine a deep and endless ocean

DAVE
What ocean
a HAROLD
‘The one made up by me filing the
stupid--
(sighs
Forget it--

A SECRETARY passes by and hands Dave two folders

SECRETARY
New audits Have a good day

Dave looksat them One folder is an inch and a half thick
the other is remarkably slim

DAVE
Okay We got a baker and a securities
trader

He looks at Harold who stares at the files eyes bugged
mouth agape Dave hands him the slim folder

DAVE (CONTD)
You know what maybe you should
take the baker

CUT TO
INT LIBERTY BAKERY -- AFTERNOON

ANA
Youre completely fucking kidding
me

Harold stands across from ANA PASCAL the aforementioned
baker a young attractive woman with tattoos up on her thin
pale arms her hands and face dusted with flour slipping
baguettes into paper sleeves in the back kitchen

The bakery is crowded with CUSTOMERS who clamor over the
searing PUNK ROCK that plays The walls are covered with
propaganda calling for the release of Leonard Peltier the
armament of the Zapatistas and even a mangled upturned
American flag that reads Boycott Starbucks All of the
WORKERS look under the age of twenty-one Most have tattoos
or piercings and one has a spiked yellow mohawk In the
corner a HOMELESS man enjoys a cup of coffee and a Danish
a MONGREL BOG lapping at a bowl of water at his side

And oddly enough all the bustle propaganda and punk rock
is surrounded by chiffon birthday cakes poppy-seed muffins
and the fluffiest most delicious-looking creme puffs youve
ever seen

ANA (CONTD)
Like seriously fucking kidding me

HAROLD

No Its illegal for me to joke
about audits

People are

ANA
God-fucking-damnit Fuck Fuck

pause

Fuck

HAROLD
I understand--

ANA

HAROLD

beginning to watch

HAROLD

can speak about this an office or--

ANA
Oh no were talkin’ about this

HAROLD
(kindly)
Okay Now you know you only paid
part of your taxes last year

ANA

Yes Of course I know
HAROLD

You know I believe only 73 percent
ANA

Yes I know Yes
HAROLD

But-- so you did it on purpose
ANA

Yes
HAROLD

So how can you not be expecting to
get audited You stole from the
government

ANA
I didnt steal from the government
I just didnt pay them entirely
HAROLD
Ms Pascal you cant just not pay
your taxes

ANA

Yes I can
HAROLD
‘Well you can if you want to get
audited
ANA

Only if I recognize your right to
audit me Mr Crick

HAROLD
Ms Pascal Im right here auditing
you And now I have to go over
your past 4 years of returns to make
sure that’s all you havent paid

ANA
Fine

Ana returns to slipping baguettes into sleeves

HAROLD
I mean is there I dont know-- a
specific reason you feel exempt from
the United States Tax Laws

ANA
No Listen I am a big supporter of
fixing potholes and erecting swingsets
and building shelters Im more
than happy to pay those taxes Im
just not a big fan of paying the
percentage the government uses for
national defense corporate loan-
outs and campaign discretionary
funds so I didnt pay those taxes
I believe I sent a letter to this
effect with my return

HAROLD
Would that be the letter beginning
with Dear Imperialist Swine

ANA
Yes

HAROLD
Ms Pascal what youre describing
is anarchy

ANA

Okay Maybe
HAROLD

So youre an anarchist

HAROLD
Of an anarchist group yes

ANA
Anarchists have a group

HAROLD
I believe so Sure

ANA
They assemble

HAROLD
I dont know

ANA
Doesnt that completely defeat the
purpose

He cant help but laugh

A timer begins to ring and Ana walks away to turn it off
not deigning to answer Harolds inquiry

NARRATOR (V0)
It was difficult for Harold to imagine
Ms Pascal as a revolutionary

HAROLD
sotto)
Not now

NARRATOR (V0O
sher thin arms hoisting protest
signs her long shapely legs dashing
from tear gas

Ana returns with fresh muffins which she begins to place on
a cooling rack Harold tries to shake off the voice

HAROLD
Im sorry I dont know if uh
« what we can do is uh uh

He becomes lost in her eyes

NARRATOR (VO)
Harold wasnt prone to fantasies
and so he tried his best to remain
professional

HAROLD
Uh

NARRATOR (V0
But of course failed

HAROLD
I uh

NARRATOR (VO)
He couldnt help but imagine Ms
Pascal stroking the side of his face
with the soft blade of her finger

HAROLD
Uh I uh

NARRATOR (V0)

‘He couldnt help but imagine her

immersed in a tub shaving her legs

ANA
--Mt Crick

- HAROLD
(jolted)
Yes Uh Uh

Harold stares at her

NARRATOR (V0
And he couldnt heip but imagine her
naked stretched across his bed--

ANA
Mr Crick

HAROLD
Yes What is it

ANA

HAROLD

Uh No Of course not I I

ANA
Mr Crick Im a very nice kind
mild-mannered person but if you
show up on Monday I guarantee
the most tedious painful and
unfruitful audit youve ever
performed

He grabs her hand and shakes it fervently

HAROLD
I cant wait Have a good day

Flustered Harold is barely able to make it out of the store

slamming the door behind him with the RING of the overhead

bell

EXT LIBERTY BAKERY -- CONTINUOUS

Harold quickly walks out of sight of the bakery and stops
He stands for a moment and takes a deep breath trying to
avoid hyperventilating

HAROLD
Come on Harold get it together

NARRATOR (VO)
Harold suddenly found himself
beleaguered and exasperated standing
outside the bakery

HAROLD
to the heavens)
OH SHUT UP

NARRATOR (V0)
--cursing the heavens in futility

HAROLD
No Im not Im cursing you you
stupid voice So shut up and leave
me alone

Blackout The following appears on screen

You control what Ill be You control who I see And if I
let you youll control me -- Bad Brains

EXT ROOFTOP OF BUILDING -- DAY

As And You Will Know Us By The Trail of Dead” begins to
play track 2 your cd) a woman in an oversized black shirt
and gray flannel pants (KAY) approaches the ledge of a
skyscraper Her face is worn beyond her age her skin has a
yellowish complexion and her body looks not unlike a piece
of paper crumpled into a ball and then thoughtlessly
restored The pants and shirt ripple around her in the wind
Her face is serene as she draws a drag from a cigarette

She gently steps up onto the ledge the rest of the city
becoming visible underneath her

Kay looks down Across the street she notices the middle-
aged black woman from the earlier scene Shes dressed very
nicely and compares a written out address on a scrap of paper
to the address on the building

Kay turns her head Coming down the street is the young
blonde boy pedaling his bicycle quickly down the sidewalk
heading directly for a large puddle behind the black woman

Kay coughs a nasty hacking cough She puts out the cigarette
on the ledge

She reaches into the breast pocket of her shirt and pulls
out a wadded piece of tissue which she opens revealing
several half smoked cigarettes She puts her current half
smoked cigarette into the tissue paper re-wads it and
replaces it in her breast pocket

She looks across the street again The young blonde boy is
only a few yards away from the puddle

Kay closes her eyes and lifts her arms up The wind courses
against her face her clothes her skin

The boys bicycle strikes the puddle splashing rain water
onto the pants of the middle-aged black woman

Kay dangles a single foot over the ledge

And with the strike of the final singular violin note she
jumps

WOMANS VOICE
Excuse me Excuse me

We
CUT TO
INT GARMENT LOFT -- AFTERNOON

Kay stands on the end of a factory table in a large poorly
converted downtown loft She wears the same clothes as she
did on the building and her foot dangles over the edge

PENNY (0S)
Excuse me ‘

Kay turns

A formidable stern-looking woman in a sensible outfit stands
in the doorway of the loft with a laptop case held by her
side ‘

Kay looks on not moving We can see the table is surrounded
by dozens of wadded up tissues several errant cigarettes

and what look to be a bunch of letters strewn about as if
recently looked through The city shines through the
numerous filthy windows that stretch across the downtown
garment loft which has been renovated into a large office

PENNY (CONTD)
Are you Ms Biffel

KAY
(in a hoarse voice)
Yes
PENNY

Penny looks at her with a looming eye

KAY
No

Penny comes over to pick up the letters She notices the
cigarettes

PENNY
Ah And I imagine you smoked all
these cigarettes

KAY
No They came pre-smoked

PENNY
(without even a smile)
Right They mentioned you were funny
Well please dont let me

Kay steps to the other edge of the table finds a cigarette
in a tissue and lights it

KAY
What do you think about leaping off
a building

PENNY
I dont think about leaping off a
building

KAY
Yes you do

PENNY

No I try to think of nice things

KAY
Everyone thinks about leaping off a
building Everyone

PENNY
Well I certainly dont think about

fantastically depressing book-- that
when you jump from a building its
rarely the impact that actually kills
you

PENNY
Well Im sure it doesnt help

KAY
Theres a Theres a photograph in

around forty years ago Called The
Leaper

KAY (CONTD)

Its old but its beautiful
From above the corpse of a woman who
had just leapt to her death Theres
theres blood around her head
like a halo And her leg is
buckled underneath her And her arm
has snapped like a twig

(pause)
But her face is so serene So at
peace

(pause)
And I think its because when she
died she could feel the wind
against her face

Kay puts out her cigarette

KAY (CONTD)
(with vuinerability)

(pause)
And if youll allow me I think it
would benefit you greatly if youd
cut back on the smoking

INT OFFICE —— AFTERNOON

Later that afternoon Harold arrives at his desk at the end
ofa long row of cubicles to find a note taped to his computer
monitor

He peels the note off and reads it

Lets chat -Dr Cayly

Harold just sighs

INT HUMAN RESOURCES OFFICES -- MOMENTS LATER

The open layout allows for noise and activity spillage from
the day care center into the common area right outside the
door of Dr Caylys office Currently three four-year-olds

are building a tower out of Lego blocks

Harold passes by but stops just before he enters the office
He looks at the tower then the blocks

CHILD
Hi

HAROLD
Youre gonna have an extra block
Probably a red one

The kids just look at him

INT CAYLYS OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

Harold sits in a small office lit by candles and Chinese

lanterns across from an older man in a puffy sweater with
his legs tucked under him in an office chair (DR CAYLY)

Behind their scene we can hear the sound of CHILDREN FIGHTING
OVER BLOCKS

CAYLY
I had a very interesting little
convo with someone in your section

HAROLD
Yeah

CAYLY
They said youre feeling a little
“wibbly-wobbly

HAROLD
Uh

CAYLY
Catch a little cubicle fever

HAROLD
I dont know I think Im okay

CAYLY
Harold a tree doesnt think its a
tree It is a tree

Harold stares blankly

NARRATOR (VO
Why was Harold talking to this man
This man was an idiot

Harold looks up Cayly speaks but we cant hear him as the
Narrator continues

NARRATOR (VO) (CONTD)
This man used words like wibbly-
wobbly” and convo and explained
that trees were trees Of course
trees were trees Harold knew trees
were trees Who doesnt know that
trees are trees

The camera begins to zoom in on the (concerned) face of
Harolds watch

NARRATOR (VO (CONTD)
What Harold didnt know was why he
couldnt shake the smell of brownies
from his senses why Ms Pascal had
made his fingertips quiver and lips
go numb And this man wasnt helping
to explain that at all nor anything
at all really Something had to
change

Suddenly Harolds watch begins to BEEP Hes jolted back to
reality and Cayly stops talking

Harold looks at his watch The face flashes blue almost as
if sending a warning

HAROLD
Sorry My thats its not
supposed to be beeping Sorry

Sorry

Harold quickly stops his watch He looks at it It looks
back

CAYLY
Harold

HAROLD
Huh Oh Sorry

CAYLY
Whats going on Harold

HAROLD
I Well

(pause

Nothing

(MORE)

ZZ

HAROLD (CONTD)
(pause) 7
Everythings fine

Cayly opens a file

CAYLY
Listen according to your record you
havent taken vacation for a few
years now How about you take a
break Use some of that “vaycay
time

HAROLD
‘Yeah Maybe thats a good idea

CAYLY
Harold Im not really supposed to
do this but

Cayly gets out of his chair and gives Harold a big hug

HAROLD
Uh Thanks

CAYLY
Take some “me time Harold Maybe
a bubble bath

Cayly winks

NARRATOR (VO)
Suddenly Harold was nauseated

INT HUMAN RESOURCES OFFICES -- CONTINUOUS

Harold comes out of Caylys office and leaves the Human
Resources offices

The camera pans down to reveal the blocks built into a series
of buildings on either side of a city street one extra red
block lying uselessly in the middle

The camera reveals a little Lego man in a bliack suit standing
next to one of the buildings until hes run over by a
Lego bus handled by one of the toddlers

DISSOLVE
TO

EXT BUS STOP - LATER

Harold stands at the bus stop next to several other COMMUTERS
He looks ready to go home crawl into bed and possibly never
come out He is so worn out he doesnt notice Ana walking
up the sidewalk across the street

Harold’s watch notices as we reveal its (excited) face but
Harold just stands there staring reticently at the asphalt

Suddenly there is a BEEPING sound A few people look around
even check their cell phones

Harold looks at his watch its blue face flashing as it BEEPS
loudly and constantly

Everyone looks at Harold

Ana continues up the street The watch keeps beeping at
Harold

NARRATOR (VO)
Harold assumed his watch was simply
on the fritz and never even thought
about what it was trying to tell
him

Harold quickly presses a few buttons but the watch will not
stop BEEPING nor flashing Harold shakes his watch

He drops his briefcase to deal with the watch but the BEEPING
only gets louder Everyone begins to stare Ana is almost
gone

NARRATOR (V0) (CONTD)
In fact Harold had never once paid
attention to his watch other than
to find out the time And honestly
it drove his watch crazy

Harold looks at the sky shaking his head Harold puts his
watch behind his back to muffle the BEEPING

NARRATOR (V0) (CONTD)
And on this particular Wednesday
evening as Harold waited for the
bus his watch suddenly stopped
if out of nothing else but sheer

frustration
But only for a brief moment after which it immediately stops
BEEPING and flashes “Enter Time Ana is gone Harold never
saw her

Harold looks at his watch He presses a button on the side

HAROLD
Uh Does somebody happen to have
the time

COMMUTER

Ive got 547
Harold quickly resets his watch to 547 and saves it

NARRATOR (V0)

So Haroids watch thrust him onto

the mercy of the immitigable path of
fate For as he reset the time of
his watch little did Harold know
that this simple seemingly innocuous
act would ultimately result in his
death

The air is sucked out of Harold as he hears this

HAROLD
What

He looks up Everyone looks

HAROLD (CONTD)

What Hey

(pause)
Did you Did you just Did
You said it would ultimately result
in my death It would Im
sorry Hello-- did you say in my
death

(pause)
Hello»

Harold quickly tries to change the reading on the watch
Frantic he is unable to get his fingers to work properly
He looks up

HAROLD (CONTD)

Why Why my death Hello Why

(pause)

Talk to me
But there is no response
Harold continues to yell into the sky but he is drowned out
by the SCREECHING BRAKES of the bus which comes to a stop
directly in front of him
INT LIVING ROOM - LATER

Harold comes barreling into his living room throws down his
briefcase and overcoat He nearly trips over his ottoman

HAROLD
Okay Where are you

INT BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Harold bursts into his bathroom and immediately grabs his
toothbrush He looks up expecting to hear the voice

He puts toothpaste on it He runs water He begins brushing

his teeth and with each move he pauses in the hopes the
voice will return

HAROLD
Why wont you say anything

He throws down his toothbrush
HAROLD (CONTD)
I heard you that would ultimately
result in his death I heard you

He spits and storms out
eve

INT BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Harold randomly begins grabbing things Ties lamps pillows
ete trying to elicit a response from the omniscient voice

HAROLD
Come on you stupid voice Harold
frantic picked up his lamp
shakes the lamp)
Harold incensed shook the hell
out of it for no apparent reason

Overcome with anguish he drops the lamp hes picked up

HAROLD (CONTD)

Upset he dropped the stupid lamp
The lamp crashed to the ground and
shattered into a hundred pieces
Harold stormed to his closet
Something

(pause)
SAY SOMETHING

He collapses against his bed

HAROLD (CONTD)
Harold distraught began to just
pause)
“Harold distraught could not
(pause)
Harold distraught”

Blackout The following appears on screen

INT THERAPISTS OFFICE -- AFTERNOON

Harold sits across from a thin very old woman in bifocals

DR MITTAG-LEFFLER in a large and upscale office He seems
uncomfortable on the long leather sofa sitting at the far

end with his legs folded and arms crossed

MITTAG-LEFFLER
So youre here not because you heard
voices but because you stopped
hearing voices

HAROLD
I I suppose

MITTAG-LEFFLER
Im afraid what youre describing is
schizophrenia

HAROLD
No No Its not schizophrenia
Its just a voice in my head I
mean I mean the voice isnt
telling me to do anything its
telling me what Ive already done
(MORE)

She shakes

HAROLD (CONTD)
Accurately and with a better
vocabulary

MITTAG-LEFFLER
Mr Crick you have a voice speaking
to you

HAROLD
No Not tome About me I am
somehow inextricably involved in
some type of story Im like a
character in my own life But
see the problem is that the voice
‘comes and goes like there are other
parts of the story not being told to
me ahd I need to know what those
other parts are before its too late

MITTAG-LEFFLER

Before the story concludes with
your death
HAROLD
Yes
her head
MITTAG-LEFFLER

Mr Crick I hate to sound like a
broken record but thats
schizophrenia

HAROLD
You dont sound like a broken record
its just not schizophrenia

She just looks at him

HAROLD (CONTD)
Okay What if what I said was true

What if please just
hypothetically If I was part of a
story a narrative even only in
my own mind

(pause

What would you suggest I do

MITTAG-LEFFLER
I would suggest you take prescribed
medication

HAROLD
Other than that

MITTAG-LEFFLER
I dont know I would Id have
you speak to someone who knows about
literature I suppose

)

HAROLD
Okay Thanks Thank you Thats
yes Thats a good idea

He stands

MITTAG-LEFFLER
But please Mr Crick if the voice
tells you to quit your job or
move into a refrigerator box or
make any unusually large weapon
purchases please call me

INT OFFICE -- AFTERNOON

Harold sits in his cubicle scouring through information
online He rubs his eyes He clicks on a link

A new window opens to reveal a picture of a man behind a
desk in an office filled with books Harold scans the web
page coming across text that reads something to the effect
of Literary Dean Emeritus Professor Jules Hilbert

He clicks on the name A new photograph is revealed of
Hilbert conducting a seminar The caption reads Professor
Hilbert in his most popular course The Entire History of
Everything Literate

Harold scans the caption His fingers stop on the name
Professor Hilbert

EXT URBAN UNIVERSITY CAMPUS -- AFTERNOON

The campus is situated in the middle of the city several
tall buildings situated around a common area a smaller
more metropolitan version of a quad

Harold consults a folded piece of yellow paper trying to
compare what it says to the series of large imposing
buildings around him

There are several COEDS studying playing catch and relaxing
on the lawns An OLDER MAN stands upright holding an old

beat up pair of glasses a couple feet below him apparently

using them to read a book that lies open at his feet

Harold continues a few steps before stopping a passing
STUDENT

HAROLD
Excuse me Hi Can you tell me
where The Erdos Offices are

STUDENT

behind that big brick building Hey

HAROLD
No Why would you--

STUDENT

Oh Hes not in The Erdos Offices
HAROLD

STUDENT

No Hes standing with his glasses
out right next to that oak tree

Harold turns

HAROLD
Oh

STUDENT
See you in class

INT ERDOS OFFICES -- MOMENTS LATER

Harold is led down a long dark corridor with rows of offices
on either side by PROFESSOR HILBERT a short older man who
speeds down the hall at a clipped pace one arm through one
sleeve of a tweed jacket holding a cup of coffee the other
out of the jacket holding the book he was reading

PROFESSOR HILBERT
So youre the young gentleman who
called me about the narrator

HAROLD
Yes

PROFESSOR HILBERT
Says youre gonna die

HAROLD
Uh yes

PROFESSOR HILBERT
Uh-huh How long has it given you
to live

HAROLD
I dont know

Professor Hilbert stops and looks squarely at Harold

PROFESSOR HILBERT
Dramatic irony Itll fuck you every
time

He pats Harold on the shoulder than leads him into an office
INT HILBERT’S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

Hilberts office is quite the same as the photograph and
matches him perfectly There are books everywhere except on
the bookshelves various laterai-thinking puzzles are strewn
about almost all solved) and several rolled up carpets
inexplicably lean in the corner A currently brewing coffee
maker sits on the windowsill

PROFESSOR HILBERT
Please Recline

Hilbert offers Harold the couch which is covered in books
Harold finds a six inch space and sits Hilbert tosses out
his coffee and pours himself another cup

PROFESSOR HILBERT (CONTD)
Coffee

HAROLD
Uh no No thank you

PROFESSOR HILBERT

How I felt about work

PROFESSOR HILBERT

PROFESSOR HILBERT
But you dont know this narrator
either

HAROLD
Well

Hilbert swallows the rest of his coffee in one guip and goes
to refill his cup

PROFESSOR HILBERT
Okay Mr Crick I cant help you

HAROLD
Why

PROFESSOR HILBERT
Well Im not an expert in crazy
Im an expert in literature and I
gotta tell you thus far theres not
a single literary thing about you

HAROLD
What

PROFESSOR HILBERT
I dont doubt you hear a voice but
it couldnt possibly be a narrator
because frankly there doesnt seem
to be much to narrate Besides that
this semester Im teaching five
courses mentoring two doctorate
candidates and Im the faculty
lifeguard at the pool

HAROLD
(devastated)
Oh I I just I thought you--

PROFESSOR HILBERT
feeling sorry for
him)
Perhaps you should keep a journal

write down what shes said to you or

something

HAROLD
I can barely remember it all I
‘just remember Little did he know

‘that this single seemingly innocuous

event would lead to his death

PROFESSOR HILBERT
(overlapping)

Aaah Ill tell you Hawaiian

coffee is simply- What

HAROLD
Little did he know this-

PROFESSOR HILBERT
Did you say Little did he know

HAROLD
Yes

PROFESSOR HILBERT
Dear God Ive written papers on
Little did he know I nearly
taught a course on Little did he
know

Harold shrugs

HAROLD
Oh

PROFESSOR HILBERT

--Sonofabitch Harold little did
he know means there’s something he

doesnt know That means theres

something you dont know Thats
Christ the voice is literally in

3rd person Did you know that

HAROLD
No I didnt know that I also

dont know what “innocuous” means

PROFESSOR HILBERT

Harold I want you to come back on
Tuesday No You could be dead by

Tuesday Come back tomorrow At
130

HAROLD
Five seconds ago you said you wouldnt
help me

PROFESSOR HILBERT
Its been a very revealing five
seconds Harold

HAROLD
pause
Okay
(pause reassured)
Okay Thank you

PROFESSOR HILBERT
Good Good Listen If the voice
returns dont resist it But don’t
provoke it And its probably wise
to avoid starting sentences with
This is the last time I dot dot
dot

Hilbert winks at him

PROFESSOR HILBERT (CONTD)
Ill see you tomorrow

INT BUS - EVENING

Harold sits alone in a seat towards the back of the bus He
stares out at the sleek city as it passes by his window He
seems deep in thought

NARRATOR
Harold was deep in thought

Harold looks up at the voice quickly He then rummages to
find a legal pad and a pen and begins transcribing the
narration as best as he can

NARRATOR (CONTD)
For a few brief moments from Born
Boulevard to Euclid Ave all the
calculations and all the time and
all the precision of Harolds life
just faded away

The bus comes to a stop and PASSENGERS get off and come on

NARRATOR (CONTD)
How perfect then that in this space
Ana Pascal would appear

He quickly looks to see Ana Pascal walking up the aisle
towards him She sees him and immediately turns around and
starts to walk back towards the front of the bus

HAROLD
Ms Pascal
(pause)
Ms Pascal

)

She cant move forward any further as a VERY LARGE MAN is
standing in her way Shes stuck

HAROLD (CONTD)

Ms Pascal its mé Harold Crick
from the IRS

She turns around In fact everyone’ turns around

ANA
Hi
HAROLD
(indicating the several
empty ones)
Hi would you like a seat
ANA
No

HAROLD
Theres eleven open ones

ANA
I dont care

The bus starts moving forward propelling her towards the

back Off balance she just sits” down across the aisle from

Harold

They look at each other uncomfortably

‘ HAROLD

ANA
Lousy Im being audited

HAROLD
Oh Of course

ANA

HAROLD
Oh

They sit awkwardly and silently

HAROLD (CONTD)
Uh I think I owe you’ an apology

pause
So I apologize I uh ogled

Ana thinks about it

ANA
Apology accepted But only because

They smile at each other
Harolds watch looks on (happily)

NARRATOR
Harold nervously made small talk

HAROLD

metropolitan transit authority too

NARRATOR
Very small talk

ANA
No Im just late

HAROLD
Ah big flag burning to get to

ANA
My weekly evil conspiracy and
needlepoint group Would you like

socialist reading material at home

She laughs A real laugh The kind you get from people who
actually like you

HAROLD (CONTD)
You uh you have uh very
straight teeth

ANA
Thanks Theyre real

NARRATOR
Harold quickly calculated the odds
of making an ass of himself in ratio
to the amount of time he stayed to
chat

HAROLD
Actually I should go This is my
stop

The side door opens and he hops ont She smiles to herself
EXT OUTSIDE BUS - CONTINUOUS

Harold steps down somewhat relieved that the conversation
was not a total travesty

NARRATOR (V0
Harold was elated and surprised by
Jhis somewhat flirtatious encounter
with Ms Pascal

Harold beams upward
NARRATOR (CONTD)
So elated he exited the Transit
Authority Bus a good 27 blocks too
early and would now have to walk
He looks around His shoulders sag
HAROLD
Goddamnit couldnt you tell me that
earlier Sonofabitch

He begins to walk down the street Bad Religion’s Stranger
Than Fiction begins (track 3 on your cd)

INT BATHROOM -- NIGHT

HAROLD brushes his teeth in his mint colored bathroom still
counting brush strokes but slightly less emphatically His
wristwatch looks on from the nightstand in a close up

INT BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

Harold crawls into bed gently removing his wristwatch and
placing it on the nightstand next to him He presses a few
of its buttons to set its alarm

EXT CITY STREET MORNING

Harold peach between his teeth hurries towards the bus
stop while putting on his black overcoat and carrying a
briefcase He counts his steps coming to a precise halt as
he reaches the stop his lips moving slightly to himself

He looks The bus is just now approaching He made it with
plenty of time

His watch (smugly) peers up at him
The music fades
INT HILBERTS OFFICE -- MORNING

Professor Hilbert a book open in his hands opens his door
and lets Harold in The office is much the same

Rain taps on the window with wet fingertips

PROFESSOR HILBERT
Mr Crick come in come in Please
How are you

HAROLD
Im Im alright actually

PROFESSOR HILBERT
Good Great Count the tiles
outside

HAROLD
(lying)
No

PROFESSOR HILBERT
(also lying
Of course not

He jumps from his seat grabs a notebook and pen and a pair
of bifocals He quickly pours himself a cup of coffee

PROFESSOR HILBERT (CONTD)
Ive devised a test-- how exciting
is that-- with around 23 questions
that I think might help uncover more
truths about this narrator Now
these may seem silly but your candor
is paramount

HAROLD
Okay Agreed

He places the notebook on the desk in front of him and holds
out his glasses

PROFESSOR HILBERT
Good So we know its a womans
voice the story involves your death
its modern its in English and Im
assuming the author has a cursory
knowledge of the city

HAROLD
Sure

PROFESSOR HILBERT
Good Okay question 1 Has anyone
recently left any gifts outside your
home anything gum money a
large wooden horse

HAROLD
What

PROFESSOR HILBERT
Harold just answer the question

HAROLD
Uh no

vue
Hilbert writeS down the answer but does not stop

PROFESSOR HILBERT
Good Do you find yourself inclined
to solve murder mysteries in large
luxurious homes to which you may or
May not have been invited

HAROLD
No No Listen--

PROFESSOR HILBERT
Okay On a scale of one to ten
what would you consider to be the
‘likelihood you might be assassinated

HAROLD
Assassinated

PROFESSOR HILBERT
One being very unlikely ten being
expecting it at every corner

HAROLD
¥ dorit I

PROFESSOR HILBERT
Perhaps let me rephrase this Are
you the King of anything

HAROLD
Like what

PROFESSOR HILBERT
Anything King of the Lanes at the
local bowling alley

HAROLD
King of the Lanes

PROFESSOR HILBERT
King of the Lanes King of the
Trolls A clandestine land found
underneath your floorboards Anything

HAROLD
No Thats ridiculous-—

PROFESSOR HILBERT
Agreed But lets start at ridiculous
and move backwards Now was any
part of you now at one time part of
something else

HAROLD
Like do I have someone elses arms

PROFESSOR HILBERT
Well is it possible that you were
at one time made of stone wood
lye varied corpse parts or earth
made holy by rabbinical elders

3Y

HAROLD
No No Thats No Im sorry
what do these questions have to do
with anything

PROFESSOR HILBERT
Nothing Thats the point

HAROLD
What

PROFESSOR HILBERT

Harold The only way to find out
what story youre in is to determine
what stories youre not in Odd as
it may seem Ive just ruled out
half of Greek literature seven fairy
tales ten Chinese fables and
determined conclusively you are not
King Hamlet Scout Finch Ms Marple
Frankensteins monster or a golem

(pause)
Arent you relieved to know youre
not a golem

HAROLD
I I guess

PROFESSOR HILBERT
Good Then just answer the
questions

A SCREECH of tires and suddenly And You Will Know Us By The
Trail of Dead (track 4 on your cd) begins to play

CcuT TO
EXT INTERSECTION -- CONTINUOUS

To avoid the young blonde boy on his new bicycle an SUV
with Kay inside is now spinning out of control across the
wet surface of a rainy intersection

The SUV hops the curh heading directly towards a boutique
shoe store

CUSTOMERS and EMPLOYEES (including the middle-aged black
woman now in an employees uniform of khakis white shirt
with a name tag) dive out of the way as the SUV crashes
violently through the front display window and into the store
the impact thrusting Kay to crash through her windshield

The SUV sends shoes and glass everywhere and comes to a halt
in the middle of the store

People rush from outside towards the store Some just stand
in shock

The young boy rides his bicycle disappearing behind a corner
Rain pours over the gash in the window jagged shards of

glass framing the destroyed SUV and Kays corpse on its hood
surrounded by scattered shoes

From behind a pile the middle-aged black woman rises unhurt
and relieved to be alive With the single note of the violin

EXT CORNER ACROSS FROM SHOE STORE -- CONTINUOUS

Across the street’ sits Kay on a bus stop bench staring across
the street and smoking She just shakes her head and disposes
of her cigarette in her bizarre disgusting manner Next to

store which is completely intact

PENNY
Kay May I ask what were doing out
here
KAY
Were imagining car wrecks
PENNY
I see And we cant imagine them
inside
KAY

No Did you know 41 of accidents
in this city occur in times of
inclement weather

PENNY
So do 90 of pneumonia cases

KAY
Really Pneumonia Thats an
interesting way to die But how
would Harold catch pneumonia
Besides it takes forever to kill
someone with pneumonia Even if he
caught it in Chapter 10 he wouldnt
finally keel over until Chapter 17
at least

Penny shakes her head

PENNY

Kay Have you actually written today
KAY

No
PENNY

Id like you to write at least a
page upon our return to the office

KAY
Fine

PENNY
And I would be remiss not to remind
you that the publishers expect to
see something soon

KAY
They can see my ass

She hacks a terrible cough Penny pulls a pamphlet out of
her jacket pocket and hands it to Kay

KAY (CONTD)
What is this

PENNY
Literature on the nicotine patch

PROFESSOR HILBERT

Okay Were done Excellent

PROFESSOR HILBERT (CONTD)
I think the next step is to determine
conclusively if youre in a comedy
or a tragedy To quote Italo Calvino
The ultimate meaning to which all
stories refer has two faces the
continuity of life the inevitability
of death”

HAROLD
pause
What

PROFESSOR HILBERT
Tragedy you die Comedy you get

hitched
HAROLD
(facetiously)
Oh Great

PROFESSOR HILBERT
Whats wrong

HAROLD
I havent even been on a date in
three years

PROFESSOR HILBERT
Well most comic heroes fall in
love with people who are introduced
after the story has begun usually
people who hate the hero initially
although I cant imagine anyone hating
you

HAROLD
Professor Hilbert Im an auditor
Nobody likes me

PROFESSOR HILBERT
Not dislikes you Hates you Detests
you lLoathes the very core of you

She takes the plate and goes to get him more cookies

She brings

She trails
proceed

Once again

HAROLD (CONTD)
So
(pause
When did you decide to become a baker

ANA
Oh In college

HAROLD
Oh Like cooking college

ANA
No I went to Harvard Law

HAROLD
Oh Oh Geez I-- sorry I just
assumed Sorry

ANA
No Its alright I didnt finish
Touh uh

a plate with more cookies to Harold

HAROLD
Did something happen
ANA
Not really I was I was barely

accepted I mean barely The only
reason they let me come was because
of my essay How I was going to
make the world a better place with
my degree And I went there
thinking well I went thinking
that I might make a difference and
uh well Harvard Law has the
smartest people in the world people
who will one day shape the earth
and its competitive and vicious and
exhausting And Id have to
participate in these study sessions
classmates and I all night long
Sometimes for a couple days straight
And so

off staring into space again unsure

she suddenly stops and looks at him

at each other for a moment

Her lips part

whether to

They stare

ou
His fingers twitch

Harolds watch looks on (anxiously)

The pad of paper reveals their lopsided fate

Harolds watch waits Then

Gently Harold pushes the plate of cookies across to her

She looks at him then at the plate

She sits down picks up a cookie then continues

ANA (CONTD)
And so I would bake-- cookies usually--
so no one would go hungry while we
worked Id bake all afternoon in
the kitchen in the dorm before a big
study session and write down what I
was doing in one of those black Mead
Journals they sell by the gross in
the Campus Bookstore And Id bring
my little treats to the study
groups and people loved them
Oatmeal Cookies Peanut Butter Bars
Chocolate Chip and Macadamia Nut
Wedges And everyone would eat and
stay happy and study harder and do
better on the tests and more people
would come to the study groups and
the study groups got better and I
would make more snacks and try to
find better recipes and the results
would always get better and better
and soon it was Cheese and Apricot
Croissants and Mocha Bars with Almond
Glaze and Lemon Chiffon Cakes with
Zesty Peach icing and our study groups
were famous around all of Cambridge
not because we had the most copious
notes or the smartest people but
because we had the best snacks

She gets up and goes to the cockie sheet and begins to remove

the cookies and put them on a large paper plate

She yanks

a strip of plastic wrap from a tube and wraps the larger

plate of cookies

ANA (CONTD)

And at the end of the spring term
IT had 27 study partners eight black
Mead journals filled with recipes

and a D average
(pause

So I dropped out Simply without

alarm and without any regrets
(pause)

I just figured if I was gonna make
the world a better place Id do

it with cookies

Harold stares at her obviously enamored She looks at his
plate Theres only one cookie left

ANA (CONTD)
Im glad you liked them

HAROLD
I uh I did Thank you for forcing
me to eat them

ANA
Youre welcome

They look at each other for a moment Harold finds himself
suddenly nervous He looks at his watch

HAROLD
I should go Thank you Thanks

She takes a moment then she offers the larger plate

ANA
Why dont you take them
HAROLD

ANA

ANA

DS

He stops He gets his coat picks up his briefcase and heads
for the door He suddenly realizes and turns around

HAROLD

(pause)
You baked those cookies for me didnt

you

Embarrassed she simply shrugs

HAROLD (CONTD)

You were trying to be nice to me and
I totally blew it

She shrugs

HAROLD (CONTD)

And that may very well be the last
time you try to be nice again

She looks at him

He hangs his head

- and then once more shrugs

He pulls out his pad and his pen

opens the pad and makes one last mark

HAROLD (CONTD)

I know thisll just sound like
gibberish to you

(pause)
»but I think Im in a tragedy

(MORE)

He
HAROLD (CONTD)
(pause)
And if I am its no ones fault

but my own

He turns and leaves

EXT CITY - NIGHT

Harold walks down the sidewalk the lights of the city playing
against all the glass and steel

NARRATOR (V0O)
‘Perhaps to say Harold Crick did not

give enough credit to fate is similar

to saying that he did not give enough
credit to major locomotive train
accidents As anyone else could
explain the precision with which
fate must work in order to cause two
trains to exist on the same track at
the same time in spite of all the
technology and human resources is
absolutely remarkable and unlike any
phenomena of the modern world

Harold has a seat at the bus stop the homeless man and his
dog sitting next to him

NARRATOR (VO) (CONTD)
Harolds death was quickly
approaching and he still remained
completely oblivious to the moment
when his Carlas and the boy on the
bicycles courses would smash into
each other Here he was Alone
Ms Pascal blocks away walking in
the opposite direction

Harold writes down the name Carla

NARRATOR (¥V0) (CONTD)
Fate like two careening locomotives
would occur with or without his
participation And the miraculous
Mathematics of this remained
inconceivable for even a true
calculator such as Harold

He writes down boy on bicycle

He sighs

NARRATOR (V0) (CONTD)
Harold could not understand fate
He could not understand the behavior
of his watch He could not even
understand the desires of his own
heart So he certainly couldnt
understand the poetry of train wrecks

CUT TO
INT LOCKER ROOM -- AFTERNOON
A locker closes revealing Professor Hilbert

PROFESSOR HILBERT
Well the first thing is dont get on
any trains

Harold stands in a suit carrying a briefcase next to OTHER
SWIMMERS who dry off from the showers We can see that
Professor Hilbert is wearing a neon green Speedo cap with
orange goggles and a pair of really tight purple Speedo
shorts Hilbert locks a combination lock and tosses a towel
around his shoulders

PROFESSOR HILBERT (CONTD)
Any idea who Carla and the boy on
the bicycle are

HAROLD
I think theyre other characters

PROFESSOR HILBERT
Maybe Maybe Fantastic

They begin to walk past the lockers and around a corner
Past the coachs office where Hilbert takes a whistle off a
hook

HAROLD
Professor Hilbert please I totally
failed at the comic hero thing In
fact I think she likes me even less

PROFESSOR HILBERT
I know Its great

HAROLD
What

They walk towards a set of doors behind which we hear water
and giggling

PROFESSOR HILBERT

You proved something else entirely
The voice seems to be dependent on
actions you take You say the voice
arrives when you do certain things
then stops when you dont do those
things It may be that you yourself
are perpetuating this story

HAROLD
Okay

PROFESSOR HILBERT
So I suggest we try something else

HAROLD
What about Ms Pascal

PROFESSOR HILBERT
Forget her

HAROLD
- Forget her Other than numbers shes
all I think about

PROFESSOR HILBERT
Harold if you want to stay alive
you have to try something else

HAROLD
Try what
‘ PROFESSOR HILBERT
‘Nothing
HAROLD
Nothing
PROFESSOR HILBERT
See some plots are moved forward
by external events or crisis others
are moved forward by the characters
themselves

He points to the door

PROFESSOR HILBERT (CONTD)

If I go through that door that plot
continues The story of me through
the door If I stay here that
plot cant move forward the story
ends

(pause)
Also if I stay here Im late

Hilbert goes through the door Harold follows
INT SWIMMING POOL -- CONTINUOUS

Several faculty members use the pool most of whom in terrible
swim attire None of them pay any attention to Harold or
Hilbert

PROFESSOR HILBERT
Harold Dont do anything tomorrow

HAROLD
What

PROFESSOR HILBERT
Stay home Dont answer the phone
Dont open the door Dont brush
your teeth

HAROLD
What about work

PROFESSOR HILBERT
Call them tonight Tell them youre
not coming

HAROLD
Dont go to work

PROFESSOR HILBERT
Don’t do anything that may move the
plot forward Instead lets see if
the plot finds you

He puts his nose plugs in and climbs up to the lifeguards
chair Harold is left standing

INT BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Harold turns down his sheets about to climb into bed He
starts to take his watch off but stops

CUT TO
INT LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

The area immediately surrounding the couch has been
transformed into a makeshift campground a cooler rests at

one end of the couch a bowl full of water rests on the coffee
table next to a bar of soap and a hand towel and bags of
beef jerky and chips are piled on the floor next to couch
Harold tosses a pillow down on the couch as a final touch

He takes his watch off

DISSOLVE
TO

INT LIVING ROOM -- MORNING

Harolds watch at rest next to the hand towel displays 715
and begins to BEEP Harold appears from underneath a blanket
on the couch already dressed He turns off the beeping
without looking at his watch

He sits up and looks at the television which is already on
He shifts as he realizes he has to pee

He sighs then reaches underneath his coffee table to pull
out a tupperware jar The camera respectfully looks away

DISSOLVE
TO

INT LIVING ROOM -- MID-MORNING

Harold continues to sit in the middle of the couch watching
television The glow from the television quickly changes

TELEVISION

a barrel of laughs Coming up next

Eighties Marathon

Harold picks up’ the remote to change the channel but
remembers He puts the remote down

DISSOLVE
TO

INT LIVING ROOM - NOON

Harold munches on packaged popcorn and watches the television
vapidly

The phone RINGS Harold looks at the phone It RINGS again
He just stares at it It RINGS again

He looks at the television then back at the telephone
longingly

DISSOLVE
TO
INT LIVING ROOM -- MID-AFTERNOON

Harold is virtually comatose

TELEVISION
Awwww that was the last episode
of “Small Wonder” for today

Harolds eyes pop open He looks’ at the television excitedly

TELEVISION (CONTD)
But dont worry we have three full
hours of MR BELVEDERE

Harolds face drops The phone RINGS again Harold sinks
his head into his hands

DISSOLVE
TO

INT LIVING ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON

Harold stares at the television the sun setting behind it
There is a SOUND at the door Harold turns to look

The mail slot opens and several different sized pieces of
mail come through the door and plop onto Harolds floor

The phone RINGS Harolds face twinges with frustration
The phone RINGS again The tv audience laughs

Suddenly Harolds watch begins to BEEP Harold shocked
goes to shut it off but stops

A shadow quickly descends over the apartment and a large
CREAKING sound can be heard Harold sees something out of
the corner of his eye He turns

Harolds POV Outside his bay window behind the television
quickly approaches a wrecking ball headed straight for the
back of Mr Belvederes head and the rest of Harolds
apartment

Harold is just able to grab his watch and jump over the back
of his couch before the wrecking ball SHATTERS the front of
Harolds apartment with a tremendous CRASH

Glass and debris are sent flying into the room as the walis
crumble around the enormous ball which stops short of the
couch at the end of its swing

Harold remains crouched behind his couch until he hears the
large CREAKING of the wrecking ball retreating He peeks
over the back

Although his couch remains intact and unmoved the rest of
Harolds living room is now a gaping hole Harold slowly
stands and can see a large crane with a wrecking ball on the
street two stories below

He walks towards the edge of his apartment

A large CREW OF PEOPLE in hardhats stand in the street
surveying the wreckage

HAROLD
HEY

At first no one notices

HAROLD (CONTD)
HEY WHAT ARE YOU DOING HEY

He shakes his arms at them
EXT STREET -- CONTINUOUS
The FOREMAN and a few members of the crew look up

wee

On the third story of a partially demolished brownstone stands

Harold yelling from the precipice of his apartment

FOREMAN
Holy crapping hell

CREW MEMBER
Who the hell is that

FOREMAN
Stop the crane-- Stop the crane

ANOTHER CREW MEMBER
STOP THE CRANE

The Foreman walks over to the sidewalk underneath Harolds
apartment

FOREMAN
Hey

HAROLD
Hey What are you doing

FOREMAN

HAROLD
Well I was watching Mr Belvedere
FOREMAN
‘Were demolishing this place
HAROLD

‘Yes its a couch Its my couch
FOREMAN
Well what is your couch doing in

HAROLD

I keep my stuff My names on the
goddamn buzzer “Harold Crick

The Foreman pauses momentarily

FOREMAN

McCarthy

HAROLD
Yes

The foreman looks at his pad

FOREMAN
Oh
(pause)
Woops

CUT TO

INT CLASSROOM - LATER

Professor Hilbert addresses his class until he is interrupted
by Harold who just barges in

Harold is a complete mess and carries two suit cases on either
side of him

HAROLD
So I was doing nothing like you
said and then a wrecking ball
came flying into my apartment

PROFESSOR HILBERT
Holy crapping hell

(CONTINUGED

HAROLD
It was Im not exactly sure it
was plot I was hoping youd just
Say it was a very bad coincidence

PROFESSOR HILBERT
Meeting an insurance agent the day
your policy runs out is coincidence
Getting a letter from the Emperor
saying hes visiting is plot

(pause)

A wrecking ball is something
else entirely

Hilberts class writes this down emphatically

CUT TO

INT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Harold and Professor Hilbert stand in the hallways continuing
their conversation

Hilbert takes a big deep breath

PROFESSOR HILBERT
(pause)
You dont control your fate Harold

HAROLD
audibly despondent)
I know

PROFESSOR HILBERT
Its Harold lets This is a
last ditch effort but its possible
I mean-- do you still have the journal
of things the narrator says

HAROLD
Yes

PROFESSOR HILBERT
Well its possible through analysis
of sentence structure and some
extensive vernacular profiling I
could conceivably figure out whos
writing this story

HAROLD
And then what

PROFESSOR HILBERT
And maybe possibly you could ask
her to stop but I cant make any
guarantees

HAROLD
Ill help you

PROFESSOR HILBERT
No You-- Harold
(pause)
You were right This narrator might
“very well kill you

HAROLD
So cant we cant we

PROFESSOR HILBERT
So I humbly suggest that you forget
this and just go live your life

‘ HAROLD
Go live my life I am living my
life Id like to continue living

my life

PROFESSOR HILBERT
Of course I know But I mean all
of it However long you have left
you can Harold you can use it to
have an adventure or discover
something or or or finish reading
Crime and Punishment hell Harold
you could just eat nothing but
pancakes if you wanted

HAROLD
Whats wrong with you I dont want
to eat nothing but pancakes I want
to live Who in their right mind
in a choice betwéen pancakes and
living chooses pancakes

PROFESSOR HILBERT

Harold if youd pause to think I
believe youd realize that that answer
is inextricably contingent upon the
type of life being led

pause)
And of course the quality of the
pancakes

They look at each other Harold opens his case and hands
Professor Hilbert his pad

PROFESSOR HILBERT (CONTD)
Do you understand what Im saying

HAROLD
Yes I do But you have to
understand that this isnt a
philosophy or a literary theory or
a story to me Its my life

PROFESSOR HILBERT
Absolutely So go make it the one
youve always wanted

This finally lands with Harold

EXT ACROSS THE STREET FROM LIBERTY BAKERY - EVENING

Harold stands on the sidewalk still carrying his suitcases
looking across the street

Ana is inside the bakery She looks lovely and smiles as
she hands the HOMELESS MAN a sandwich and gives his dog some
water

Harold just takes a hefty sigh He looks up as if asking
the voice for guidance

None comes

Harold watch looks on (hopefully)

But Harold just turns and walks up the street
INT DAVES GUEST BEDROOM LATER

Dave opens the door to his guest bedroom a small room
dedicated exclusively to Battlestar Galactica paraphernalia
including posters models of the ships and dozens of life-
sized cardboard cut-outs of the characters all standing in a
group facing the bed Harold looks at the room trying to
hide his fear and repulsion

DAVE
Heres your room Or as I like to
call it Sleep Pod 2

Harold enters and puts down his suitcases

HAROLD
Thanks Dave

DAVE
No problem Dude Itll be nice

INT MUSIC STORE -- AFTERNOON
Harold stands in the electric guitar section of a large
corporate music store staring at the rows of guitars that
hang in front of him

The Narrator begins to speak

NARRATOR (VO)
122 guitars 732 strings 257
pickups 189 volume nobs Here
Harold stood face to face with his
oldest desire and stand is almost
all Harold did

Harold looks up at the voice He shakes his head then turns
to look at some of the guitars that hang to his right

NARRATOR (V0) (CONTD)
It wasnt just about finding a

guitar it was about finding a
guitar that said something about
Harold

Harold picks up and inspects a black Les Paul guitar with a
rose emblazoned on its body

NARRATOR (VO (CONTD)
Unfortunately this guitar said When
I get back to Georgia that woman
gonna feel my pain”

Harold puts it back He touches a Flying V shaped Peavey
painted silver

NARRATOR (VO) (CONTD)
This one said something along the
lines of Why yes these pants are
lycra

Harold walks a few steps and stops at an acoustic guitar

NARRATOR (V0) (CONTD)
Im very sensitive very caring and
I have absolutely no idea how to
play the guitar”

Harold eyes a totally tricked out Double Neck Gibson SG with
a pickup toggle various knobs a whammy bar and a picture
of a dragon airbrushed on its facade

NARRATOR (CONTD)
Im compensating for something
Guess what

Slightly exasperated he turns away from the wall and suddenly
stops short

Across the room under a sign that reads USED SLASHED
PRICES AS IS is a beat up old Fender Stratocaster with a
chunk missing out of the top of the body

Harold smiles

NARRATOR (CONTD)
And then Harold saw it a damaged
and terribly mistreated Fender staring
back at him

MORE

NARRATOR (CONTD)
Despite its obvious maladies the
guitar spoke with conviction and
swagger In fact it looked Harold
directly in the eye and very plainly
stated I rock”

reviving his hope and developing a

was still incomplete

(pause)
And Harolds wristwatch wasnt about
to let him miss another opportunity

He begins to strum the opening chords to Punk Rock Girl™ by
the Dead Milkmen (track 6 on your cd) He hits the main
riff and begins to sing

Both are asleep Ana tucked in Harolds clavicle Harold

flat on his back The camera slowly descends drawing closer
to his face It swings to reveal the room the socialist
propaganda the red star flag the sleek furniture and
back to Harold who rests peacefully tranquil still

NARRATOR
Harolds life like the life of every
human being was filled with moments
both significant and mundane

He opens his eyes

NARRATOR (CONTD)
But to Harold those moments remained
entirely indistinguishable except
for this

Ana sighs and nuzzles his chest

NARRATOR (CONTD)
As Ana let out a soft sigh and
repositioned herself against him
Harold knew somewhere this was one
of the significant moments He knew
she had fallen in love with him

Harold smiles and simply closes his eyes

INT ANAS BEDROOM -- MORNING

them likely candidates to write your
story based on the criteria you and
I have already determined If your

narrator is alive shes on this
list

HAROLD
Wow

PROFESSOR HILBERT

But it appears the list is of little
use to you now

HAROLD

I suppose Although I can hang on
to it--

PROFESSOR HILBERT

Hold on a minute

Hilbert turns
our surprise

up the volume on the television Perhaps to

one of the dour women is in fact Kay

who sits

in a black Donna Karan suit across from a very smarmy-looking
ANCHORWOMAN with short sensible hair The interview is
obviously years old and Kay is much healthier

Harold jumps off the sidewalk and runs across the street
Nearly getting hit by a taxi cab A few loose coins drop
from his fist in the hustle but he doesnt have the time to
pick them up

He makes it across the street but just as he approaches the
phone booth an OLD MAN climbs in The man looks as though
as he will take a while

NARRATOR (VO) (CONTD)
But just as Harold neared the phone
it became occupied by a nearsighted
octogenarian determined to reach his
niece in Denver no matter how many
quarters it took

NARRATOR
The first phone failed to give a
dial tone

Harold slams the receiver down He reaches for the second
stopping short as he notices its covered with a greenish
phlegmy material

And the second seemed to be splattered
with a fresh batch of mucous Harold
moved on quickly

a specific forceful push

into his hands as we can hear clanging from the other room

After a few moments Ana returns with cookies and milk

ANA (CONTD)
Harold Please Tell me

Harold takes a cookie

HAROLD

Its you Its youve

(pause)
Ive been an auditor for nine years
now I answered a classified ad I
wanted to be a theorist you know
someone who discovered nuances in
mathematical systems but I chose
auditing because I thought I
figured it was easy and I was
counting everything anyway And I
had this unwavering belief in a world
of absolutes And I thought somehow
I could prove it But I couldnt
And before I realized it I developed
this pattern this compartmentalized
approach to every aspect of my life
that I maintained so I could be safe
I had become my own mathematical
system with no nuances to discover

pause)
And then everything changed And my
watch began to act funny And I
couldnt concentrate And people
began telling me things that made me
believe that my world was in fact
chaos and anarchy

(pause)
But its not Unfortunately for
me its not anarchy Because
last night after we made love
you sighed and re-positioned your
head on my chest you proved my
belief in a world of absolutes

Ana looks at him she reaches and takes his face in her
hand

ANA
Come on

The Pixies “Monkey Gone To Heaven track 7 on your cd

INT BUS - AFTERNOON

Harold sits in the back of the bus staring out the window
He looks down at the seat next to him There sits Kays
manuscript

He looks at it for a moment Then as if he has no other
choice he picks it up

He turns the page and begins to read

DISSOLVE

TO

A few people get on the bus as a few others leave Harold
is still in the back continuing to read He chuckles to
himself at something in the book

DISSOLVE

TO

The bus makes a left turn The downtown skyline becomes
visible in the background The sun is beginning to set and
the sky has grown dim Harold around half way through the
book turns the page and gasps slightly We can see hes
become involved in the story

DISSOLVE

TO
The bus is stopped and there are no passengers and no driver

We can see other parked buses out the window But Harold
doesnt move still reading the book

A NEW DRIVER steps on board and sees Harold Harold doesnt
look up The driver contemplates asking Harold for fare
but decides against it

DISSOLV
TO

Harold continues to read night having fallen over the city
The bus has begun to move again and the glint of lights pass
by Harold rubs his eyes Hes reached the yellow pages
He takes a deep breath then continues reading

DISSOLV
TO

Only a few people sit om the bus all in the front Harold
remains in the back seat alone He turns over the very
last yellow page of the book

He looks outside Its dark He squints to see a street
sign Then nods The song ends as he continues to ride on

EXT GARMENT LOFT -- NIGHT

Kay closes the large steel door to the loft building her
office resides in and begins up the street

A bus comes to a stop at the nearest corner Its doors open
and Harold steps off

He sees her and walks towards her

HAROLD
Ms Eiffel

She looks up

KAY
Harold
HAROLD
I uh
(pause)

I just finished it

KAY
You just oh

HAROLD
Iouh I read it all in one read
on the bus

She nods nervously
HAROLD (CONTD)
pause)

Its lovely I like the part about
the guitars

KAY
(shrugs)

(pause)
Im going to--

HAROLD
No dont

on KAY
Harold I Listen--

HAROLD
No I read it And I loved it
‘And theres only one way it can end
It ends with me dying I mean I
dont have much background in

literary anything but this seems
simple enough
(pause)

Its my fate I cant escape it
You cant escape it either As much
as I want to believe that you or I
or Professor Hilbert can control
when and where I die or when and
where I fall in love or even when
and where my watch goes on the
fritz its just not the truth
All I know is that a series of events
has been set into motion that
none of us are able to do anything
about And so we all have to learn
to accept it And move on with our
lives For however long they last

He hands her the manuscript

HAROLD (CONTD)
I love your book And I think you
should finish it

INT LIVING ROOM - LATER

Harold enters his apartment He looks briefly at the plastic
that now constitutes his front wall He chuckles and
continues towards the bedroom

NARRATOR (V0
The night before his death Harold
unceremoniously went about some
necessary business

watched old movies

INT ANAS APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS

Harold holds Ana in his arms as the glow of the television
washes over them Ana laughs at something she sees Harold
chuckles understandably distant

NARRATOR (V0
It was a nice enough evening and in
any other circumstance would seem
commonplace In fact the only thing
that made this night significant was
the morning it’ preceded

INT ANAS BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Ana and Harold look at each other their heads on their
respective pillows Ana traces her fingertips across Harolds
shoulder

HAROLD
(softly)
I have to tell you something

ANA
(teasing)
Is it a secret

HAROLD
Sort of
(long pause)
I adore you

ANA
(touched)
I adore you

Harolds watch looks on (despondently)

ANA (CONTD)
Was that it

HAROLD
‘No I have to tell you this and
I want you to just listen carefully

Harold takes a deep breath

o HAROLD (CONTD)
(pause sincerely)

You can subtract the value of the
food you give away every night to
the shelter as a charitable
contribution It in fact amounts
to more than what youre currently
withholding and doesnt break any
tax laws

She looks at him smiling
ANA
Harold The whole idea is to break
the tax laws
HAROLD
Well this way youre not paying
for defense or going to jail and
you can still write whatever nasty
letters you want
ANA
Youre very strange Harold Crick
But I like you anyway
She gives him another kiss

ANA (CONTD)
Goodnight

She puts her head back on her pillow and closes her eyes
Harold looks at her for a moment Then he turns over picks
up his watch and sets its alarm

Blackout The following appears on screen

TI cant wait to die I can find this song Its where
Ill find my life when Im through with my present one --
Shellac

EXT CITY -- MORNING

The sun lifts above the citys skyline splitting through
the buildings and reflecting off the steel and glass

Traffic moves down the interstate
Street cleaners motor through the streets
JOGGERS pass each other on the sidewalks

Buses leave their terminals

INT ANAS BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

And Harold sits at the edge of the bed staring out the window
at the city

His wrist watch changes to 715

It begins to beep

Harold quickly turns it off Ana rustles
Harold takes a deep breath

INT ANAS BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

Harold brushes his teeth not paying attention to how he
does it

NARRATOR (VO)
That particular Thursday morning was
brisk and unsuspecting as was
Harold
Harold looks up coyly smiling

NARRATOR (VO) (CONTD)
He brushed his teeth albeit in
vain

INT ANAS BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
As Ana still sleeps Harold flips his tie over itself

NARRATOR (V0O)
He prepared for work in vain

INT ANAS APARTMENT -- MOMENTS LATER
Harold eats some cereal while looking through a morning paper
NARRATOR (VO)
And he ate a sensible breakfast
also in vain

INT ANAS BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

Harold goes to the nightstand retrieves his watch and puts
it on He gives Ana a tender kiss on the cheek

HAROLD
(softly)
Bye

EXT CITY STREET -- MOMENTS LATER

Harold calmly walks down the sidewalk taking in the city
air as much as he can

NARRATOR (VO)
Much had changed for Harold over the
past few weeks his attitude towards
(MORE)

NARRATOR (VQO) (CONTD)
work his eating habits his habitual
counting his love life his ability
to rock but of all the
‘transmutations Harold Crick had
undergone perhaps the most
significant was that he was no longer
late for the 817 Faraday Bus

Harold continues to walk
EXT BUS STOP -- MOMENTS LATER

Harold stands at the bus stop a few other commuters around
him including the Polish woman from before

NARRATOR (VO)
What Harold had never understood
about that Wednesday two weeks prior
was that the time he received from
his fellow commuter was in fact
three full minutes later than the
actual time and therefore three
full minutes later than the time to
which his watch had been previously
set Wot the worst of oversights
one might assume but it meant
that Harold had been living his life
three minutes ahead of schedule
And if Harold had not set his watch
to the incorrect time Harold would
have continued to barely catch the
817 Faraday bus’ and he would not
be at the bus stop precisely at 816
this particular Thursday An
otherwise ignorable fact until the
unthinkable occurred

Suddenly And You Will Know Us By The Trail of Deads How
Near How Far (track 8 on your cd) begins to play

01 The blonde boy helmet on comes unsuspectingly speeding
down the sidewalk on his bicycle

05 Harold smiles at the Polish Woman

07 The bus comes rounding the corner and towards the bus
stop

10 All the other commuters step forward towards the bus
Harold remains staring at the sky

713 The boy approaches the crowd of commuters quickly
16 As does the bus

20 Harold continues to stare at the sky

23 The boy swerves to miss the commuters spilling his

bicycle off the curb where it topples sending him into the
street

28 The boy tries to get up but his loose helmet has swung
around to cover his face

233 Harold calmly steps out into the street
38 The bus begins to screech as it tries to brake

40 Harold pushes the boy out of the way but finds himself
in the path of the bus Harold has just enough time to turn
his hand flying up to cover his head before

SCREECH
The bus SMACKS into Harold

Harolds watch shatters as the bus hits it Glass and small
bits of metal fly everywhere Harolds body distorts as it
is pounded by the front of the bus

Harold is sent flying He hits the ground with a decided
THUD

His body lies lifeless on the asphalt As the crowd begins
to gather around him blood can be seen pouring from his
head Despite the chaos that surrounds him his body rests
in perfect stillness

Harolds body rests lifeless in the middle of the street
From above we see his legs are buckled underneath him and
blood has formed a halo around his head his arm snapped
like a twig But his face is peaceful

Harold Crick lies dead in the street
INT GARMENT LOFT - CONTINUOUS

Kay sits at her desk typing Shes obviously crying her
hands trembling

She reaches in her pocket and pulls out a wadded tissue paper
which she unravels revealing a cigarette butt She is
shaking so much she can barely coax the cigarette between

her lips She reaches across the desk for a lighter

Her fingers are no longer functional as she tries in vain to
get it to light But she cant

And then she stops She stares at the cigarette She
swallows her tears and crumples the cigarette in her hand

EXT BUS STOP -- CONTINUOUS

And You Will Know Us By The Trail of Dead begins once again
track 8 contd)

The bus door opens and the middle-aged black women incredibly
upset steps off the bus She wears a drivers blue uniform
her name patch reading Carla She is immediately comforted
as someone quickly says Its not your fault

The blonde boy gets up Other than a scraped elbow hes
perfectly fine

He is attended’ to by a CONCERNED WOMAN who leads him to the
curb

But most of the activity surrounds Harold who has not moved
People hold ONLOOKERS back a’ few people sob in despair
Most just stare’ in horror

And then suddenly with the single violin note Harolds
eyes open

With a rush of sound a cacophony of people can be heard
saying Youre gomna be okay Call an ambulance Dont
move him

Harold looks at all the peering faces including the sweet-
looking Polish woman

HAROLD
Am I
(pause)
Am I dead
POLISH WOMAN
(kindly)
No ‘You are alive
HAROLD
(pause)
Why

The Polish woman shrugs reassuringly
POLISH WOMAN
(pause)
If it is any consolation you are
hurt very very badly
Harold smiles at her
Blackout The following appears on screen

Of all the minutes that were taken away will your watch
be waiting - At The Drive-In

INT HILBERTS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Professor Hilbert stares out his window looking at the
activity of the college forlorn He sips some juice

There is a knock at his door

of the DOOR OPENING and CLOSING behind him

She offers it to him He looks at it

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Harold wakes up in a hospital room sunlight pouring in
His leg is in a cast his right arm in a sling his head is

bandaged and his left wrist is covered in gauze

A friendly-looking DOCTOR is currently reviewing his file

Ouch Is uh Is that boy okay
DOCTOR

HAROID

DOCTOR

hand

(reads excitedly)
Looks like you cracked your head
broke three bones in your leg and
foot suffered four broken ribs
fractured your right arm and you
severed an artery in your left arm
which couldve been really bad but
amazingly a shard of metal from your
watch became lodged in the artery
causing your heart rate to slow
keeping your loss of blood down enough
to keep you alive which is pretty
cool

HAROLD
Wow

DOCTOR
Yeah With some physical therapy
and a few months of rest you should
be fine Well sort of We
couldnt remove the shard of watch
without risking major muscular damage
Itll be okay youll just have a
watch piece embedded in your arm for
the rest of your life

Harold chuckles and looks at his wrist

DOCTOR (CONTD)

Crick

He stares at her

Suddenly she stops and looks at him

other for a moment

Her lips part

His fingers twitch

The skull on Hilberts carpets looks on (anxiously)

The manuscript reveals their lopsided fate

Then

They stare at each

KaY (CONTD)

We hear him walk away and the office door close as we zoom
in on the last paragraph which begins with the words As
Harold took a bite of Bavarian Sugar Cookie

INT HOSPITAL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
Harold takes a bite of Bavarian Sugar Cookie

NARRATOR (VO)

As Harold took a bite of Bavarian
Sugar Cookie he finally felt as if
everything was going to be okay

fear and despair in routine and
constancy in hopelessness and
tragedy there are Bavarian Sugar
cookies
