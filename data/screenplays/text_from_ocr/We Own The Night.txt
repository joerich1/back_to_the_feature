FADE IN

A PAIR OF SMOKESTACKS AGAINST AN ORANGE AUTUMN SUN SKY
THE CAMERA ZOOMS OUT to REVEAL A CEMETERY in the
foreground TOMBSTONES blend into a NEVER-ENDING SEA OF
MIDDLE-CLASS ROW HOUSES in the distance and nothing seems
to separate the two A NEWLY DUG GRAVE is in the LOWER
LEFT-HAND CORNER of our FRAME

MILITARY DRUMS HUNDREDS of POLICEMEN in their DRESS
BLUES ENTER from FRAME RIGHT A FEW COPS CARRY a COFFIN

SUPERIMPOSE ON THE SCREENS LEFT SIDE THE FOLLOWING WORDS
FADE IN--PARAGRAPH BY PARAGRAPH

New York New York 1988

A new breed of narcotics has swept the great city bringing
with it a ferocious crime wave more terrifying than any in
recent memory

The old criminal order is gone In its place new ethnic
groups rise up to seize control without respect for
traditional rules of engagement

Outmanned and outgunned demoralized by cutbacks and
scandal the Police find themselves burying one of their
own at the rate of twice a month

The WORDS TURN BLOOD RED then DISAPPEAR The POLICE LOWER
THE COFFIN when they arrive at the SITE As we begin to
ZOOM INTO a CLOSE ANGLE ON THEM we HEAR MUSIC A THUMPING
POP BEAT THE CLASHS ROCK THE CASBAH

SMASH CUT TO

CLOSE ON BOBBY GREEN thirty He is passionate and vital
and handsome a real physical presence His CLOTHES are

stylish expensive A sly SMILE He steps forward into

INT STOREROOM
The camera MOVES with him to SEE ROSARIO DIAZ twenties
dark-skinned impossibly gorgeous Leaning up against the
wall biting her lower lip eyeing Bobby with true desire

BOBBY GREEN
youre so fuckin beautiful you
know that

She beams They kiss PASSIONATELY SUPERIMPOSE
BROOKLYN They really GO AT IT They are ferocious as
they DEVOUR each other

ROSARIO DIAZ
I love you baby

Then we HEAR a fist BANGING ON A DOOR a MUFFLED VOICE

MUFFLED VOICE
Bobby You in there

No ANSWER--theyre too busy making out Then MORE
BANGING They both START LAUGHING The voice continues

MUFFLED VOICE (CONTD)
Bobby If you two could just
keep your hands off each other for
a second--I I think we got a
situation brewin out front

ROSARIO DIAZ
Its Jumbo We gotta go anyway

BOBBY GREEN
(beat to the door)
Ill be out in a second Louis

She grabs him he moves back in starts MAULING her again
She SLIDES DOWN his body perhaps to perform fellatio

CUT TO

INT EL CARIBE NIGHTCLUB - MAIN ROOM
A huge bustling vibrant nightclub very 80s Decadent
pure New York BOBBY emerges from the back room area
straightening out his outfit ROSARIO is behind him
fixing herself and walking toward the front of the club
Bobby enters the PULSING VITAL HEART of the place As he
appears everyone approaches happily shouting out his
name He is having a blast

Bobby is the master of this domain An 80s version of
Tony Manero from SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER but without kitsch
He is genuine cool MUSIC BLONDIES HEART OF GLASS
Bobby waves hello to people greets them (Hey baby) a
pretty girl kisses him (the women love him) Moves with a
swagger a DANCE As he sways he re-buttons his shirt
claps his hands He is the CLUB MANAGER and HE LOVES
every minute of it Hes GIDDY ALIVE a PERMANENT GRIN
WE WANT HIS LIFE SENSUOUS SEDUCTIVE INCREDIBLE FUN

A MAN waves to BOBBY Bobby SEES seated at a table
surrounded by his gang VADIM NEZHINSKI Thirty-five acne-
scarred huge black pompadour big gut One of his men
PAVEL LUBYARSKY is next to him Bobby nods back to them

NEAR THE COAT CHECK

Rosario meets up with several of her girlfriends and we
SEE an OPERATION at work people come get their coats
slide the coat check girls a HUNDRED BUCKS and with their
coats the patrons get JUNK put in their jacket pockets
Rosario looks to one of her girls--ALINA a young Russian
with too much makeup--and counts the cash Pockets some of
it From Rosarios BEHAVIOR we SEE shes INVOLVED in the
DRUG TRADE

INT THE FRONT OF THE ESTABLISHMENT - LOBBY

A HUGE FIGHT thats breaking out Violent Club patrons
and SECURITY GUYS are in the melee Girls SCREAM ROSARIO
moves past all this to the front door LOUIS FALSETTI
forty backs off from the multiple struggles all around
him Louis is wearing a jacket that says SECURITY on it
He is the jocular type very overweight redfaced Bobby
arrives at the fight scene With cheery braggadocio

BOBBY GREEN
What the fucks goin on in here

Bobby moves RIGHT IN Grabs a struggling and drunk PATRON
puts him in a headlock He gives the Patron a SHOT TO THE
TEMPLE just to keep him docile Lou Bobbys best friend
watches the imbroglio with an amused and cowardly
detachment CHORTLING with every punch and scream He
balances a drink in his hand with marvelous care avoiding
spillage But the BATTLE GETS CLOSER AND CLOSER Seeing
his friend Bobby whos hardly got everything in control

LOUIS FALSETTI
Okay Bobkes Looks like you got
everything under control here--so
uh so Im gonna go outside take
my break

BOBBY GREEN
Yeah--just keep that wide load of
yours outta trouble arright

LOUIS FALSETTI
Yes your fuckin majesty

The Patron is acting up again trying to free himself from
Bobbys grip Bobby looks down at him With humor

BOBBY GREEN
Whatre you doing You gotta
behave yourself here

Gives the guy a shot in the head Meanwhile LOUIS
saunters past the melee jumping gracefully over a fallen
drunk He BOWS in triumph when others applaud his leap
Everyone laughs as he goes out the door Bouncer FREDDIE
helps clean up the mess A GIRL SCREAMS as a GUY is
flipped on his back by bouncers A PATRON with BLOOD ON
HIS FACE acting like an eight year-old to Bobby (who
hurls his guy out of frame)

BLOODIED PATRON
Cmon Mr Green I didnt do

BOBBY GREEN

INT MARAT BUZHAYEVS APARTMENT - FOYERLIVING ROOM

Plush couches clutter Bobby walks in

We HEAR RADIO MUSIC up here nothing like the stuff played
downstairs A RUSSIAN CROONER In an EASY CHAIR sits

MARAT BUZHAYEV (pronounced BOO-SHY-EV) He is old
kindly weakened by age sits next to his babushka wife
KALINA Buzhayev watches a Russian musical program with
the sound off listening to his small transistor radio

MARAT BUZHAYEV
Bobby Come here

BOBBY GREEN

Bobby leans over hugs the seated old man The two EMBRACE
WARMLY--they are close Before separating Buzhayev
touches his face KALINA yells happily in RUSSIAN grabs
BOBBY embraces him too She couldnt be more motherly
amd Bobby BEAMS at the treatment

KALINA BUZHAYEV (SUBTITLE)
So beautiful Beautiful
Bobby is moved almost embarrassed by the loving attention
Then gently dropping a set of KEYS on a side table

BOBBY GREEN
Listen Mr Buzhayev--I gotta go do
something right now But dont
worry--everythings in good shape
downstairs

MARAT BUZHAYEV
(warm gentle)
Yes good You take care of things

Marat smiles Then as Bobby stands

MARAT BUZHAYEV (CONTD)
Next week you come by--we talk
Okay We talk about plans for you

Bobby lights up nods Marat pats his cheek Kalina tries
to give him a small care package of food He politely
refuses and a minor and friendly AD-LIBBED argument in
Russian (He said he didnt want any food and you keep
trying to give it to him) breaks out between the old
husband and his wife As Bobby exits

KALINA BUZHAYEV
(broken English)
Bobby Where you run off to

through the glass to SEE Burt still speaking to the Mayor

Bobby storms out of the room to

INT HALLWAY

He turns toward Intensive Care SEES a CROWD DOWN THE
HALL Two GUARDS block the doors to the ward Determined
Bobby decides to walk over

GUARD
Sorry Nobodys allowed in except

BOBBY GREEN

Bobby hurriedly takes out his wallet As he does we HEAR
a SOFT CHIME A WOMANS VOICE SOUNDS on the PA

WOMANS VOICE

Charges past the Guard

silent out of respect Bobby steps back Sandra turns to

look at Bobby To the Guards

SANDRA GRUSINSKY

Bobby walks toward the entrance Stops Sandra seems to
read his mind speaks

SANDRA GRUSINSKY (CONTD)

Bobby nods subtly mouths a THANK YOU The Guards step
aside He walks to the doors Pauses ENTERS

INT WARD

Josephs bed is in the back of the large space His face
is blocked by hospital curtains Bobby steps forward

Slowly he walks to his brothers bed He peels away the
CURTAIN Looks at JOSEPHS FACE Josephs visage is
completely RAVAGED on the left side covered with bandages
that are soaked with blood A TERRIBLE IMAGE The emotion
surges within him hes HEARTBROKEN

It is a surprisingly painful moment We can TELL he didnt
expect this level of destruction His mouth drops open
slightly Josephs eyes open just a bit but dont look at
Bobby Bobby slowly lifts his fingers touches Joes arm
gently His fingers move down to his brothers hand
Joseph is unresponsive but conscious All of a sudden

NURSE
Sir

Josephs hand closes around Bobbys fingers The
connection is huge Bobbys eyes well up and he rubs
them almost ashamed of the emotion It is a shocking
OUTPOURING of FEELING from him

He leans over haltingly kisses his brothers forehead

NURSE (CONTD)
Sir Im sorry--ICU visiting
hours are over

He waits a beat The Nurse gently pulls his shoulder He
backs away his eyes reddened The camera MOVES INTO a
CLOSE SHOT on BOBBY as we GO TO

Behind her is ROSARIO (The woman who answers the door is
clearly Rosarios mother)

INT ROSARIOS APARTMENT - FOYER

Rosarios mother discreetly backs away from the door He
and Rosario stare at each other for a moment Bobby gropes
for words His emotions bubble up inside of him then
barely audible his voice cracking

BOBBY GREEN
Feels like it was my fault

He sinks down holding her tight his head at her stomach
She gently strokes his hair kissing the top of his head

She shakes her head to reassure him whispering
nono In this moment he needs her In this
moment he is like a twelve year-old boy

DISSOLVE TO
INT CAFE CAPPUCCINO - BRIGHTON AVENUE - NIGHT

drinking coffee after their nights on the town Bobby and
Rosario and Louis sit at one of the tables Bobby kisses
Rosario on her forehead as she reaches into her purse She
looks through a small ziplock bag with a vial of cocaine
Louis meanwhile is unaware of Bobbys state of mind and
is busy putting on a show--as usual

He stumbles They pick him up lead him to a door

INT TENEMENT - APARTMENT - FRONT ROOM

Someone pulls the hood off him Bobby looks around The
room is ABSOLUTELY BARE The driver puts Bobbys bag of
money down on the floor A TEENAGED BOY wearing a SURGICAL
MASK comes and puts one on Bobbys face as well Bobby
surveys the place Where the hell is he With that mask

on his face we HEAR his BREATHING loud and present
through the sequence

It could be night or day we wouldnt know The windows
are blocked with duct tape to obscure all light There is
VISQUINE hanging from seemingly everywhere Parts of rooms
are cordoned off with the material SILHOUETTED FIGURES
ROAM through the space like apparitions A SLAVIC-LOOKING
MAN takes Bobbys bag of money leaves the room

IN THE HALLWAY

Stands Pavel masked as well armed now with a Kalashnikov
rifle Without a word he motions with a move of his head
to Bobby FOLLOW ME he seems to be saying

INT BEDROOM

Bobby enters the room right behind Pavel He SEES a
dresser with a clock on it and a small mirror Tables set
up in the middle of the room with brown jars on them
There is a television on in the corner a Russian ethnic
musical program silently unfolding

There are other people in the room a BROWN-HAIRED MAN and
two dark-haired SLAVIC-LOOKING WOMEN Its an assembly
line for the preparation of narcotics

The SLAVIC MAN takes out the STACKS OF BILLS Starts
counting them methodically Pavel motions to the Brown-
Haired Man puts up two fingers

On cue the Brown-Haired Man rubs his hands together then
takes two large JARS from his desk Beneath the desk
Bobby spots what looks like an ENORMOUS NUMBER of packages
of NARCOTICS stacked against the wall

This is clearly THEIR STASH HOUSE The Brown-Haired Man
pours powdery contents from a jar out onto his desk
blotter He sits down takes off his jacket REVEALING
TATTOOS UP AND DOWN BOTH OF HIS ARMS

The designs combine several images--skulls snakes and the
SPIDER WEB element that marked Vadims own tattoo

He takes a RUSTY LETTER OPENER--it had been sitting atop
the desk--and pierces a GREEN PACKAGE White powder seeps
from the package

Bobby watches from behind the mask as the man pushes and
pulls what looks like pure cocaine in powder form He uses
two PLAYING CARDS to move the drug Bobby eyes that RUSTY
LETTER OPENER

The Brown-Haired Man dips a measuring spoon in another
powder to add to the mix He is cutting the drug He
continues to manipulate the substance and his hands move
with a kind of grace that one expects from a seasoned chef
on a cooking show

CLOSE SHOT on some lines of COCAINE Pavel takes a toot
He OFFERS it to Bobby as a taste Bobby accepts He pulls
down his mask momentarily RUBBING a RATHER LARGE QUANTITY
OF THE DRUG ON HIS GUMS HIS LIP We HEAR

VADIM NEZHINSKIS VOICE

Bobby looks over to see EMERGING FROM THE BLACK FROM DOWN
A DARKENED HALLWAY VADIM NEZHINSKI Everyone is wearing a
surgical mask--except of course for him Bobby eyes him

with eyes that seem to become more BLOODSHOT by the second

VADIM NEZHINSKI

VADIM NEZHINSKI (CONTD)

BOBBY GREEN (CONTD)
You wanna search me again you go
“head I just wanna make this deal

Vadim violently pulls out Bobbys pockets Out falls a
WALLET SOME CHANGE KEYS A CIGARETTE LIGHTER MATCHES
He sifts through the items lighting the lighter It
fires Bobby gets slightly edgy Notices that the others
congregate around the objects from his pocket--all except
for Pavel who holds an AK-47 trained on Bobby
Bobby inches ever closer to the rusted LETTER OPENER that
the Brown-Haired Man had used to open a package of cocaine
Vadim puts down the lighter And it occurs to him
VADIM NEZHINSKI
You got both matches and a lighter
Bobby realizes instantly that Vadim is right Bobby
shrugs feigning innocence He braces himself and decides
to give the signal
BOBBY GREEN

PAVEL LUBYARSKY
(BEFUDDLED)
What you say
Bobby looks around Theres NO CAVALRY TO THE RESCUE
He

tries again

BOBBY GREEN

Still NOTHING PAVELS attention turns to VADIM He moves
toward NEZHINSKI who

Starts FRANTICALLY POUNDING THE LIGHTER against the DESK
Trying break it open Bobby scans the joint The MEN
are trained on that lighter and this is his chance He
slips the LETTER OPENER into his hand

SEEMS LIKE WE CAN LITERALLY HEAR THE BLOOD RUSHING THROUGH
BOBBYS HEAD NOW Setting himself Bobby looks around the
room--wheres that backup--and the camera SPEEDS PAST
Pavels and Vadims faces to the other side of the room
It MOVES toward the WINDOW

Burt is getting emotional aware of how close his son came
to death Trying not to show it--and failing

BURT GRUSINSKY

With that the Medic returns and with a heavy heart Burt
closes the ambulance door Bobby is alone with the Medic

Burt shakes his head moves to help with the vest

BURT GRUSINSKY
Nah were good Its just I just

BURT GRUSINSKY (CONTD)
Once this is over you and your

BOBBY GREEN

BURT GRUSINSKY
Bobby--your brother I think he
probably feels a little guilty
with everything you did with you
in protection now But he
appreciates what youve done--I
know he does

Rosario is right behind them listening When Burt stares
at her she averts his gaze Burt changes course

BURT GRUSINSKY (CONTD)
Look Im just trying to keep us
together here thats all Thats
all I want

BOBBY GREEN
(relents a bit nods)
I know Pop

Burt warms slightly too A beat then the CARS PULL UP
Bobby looks at his father with real feeling Burt eyes
him then touches Bobbys cheek a truly loving gesture

BURT GRUSINSKY
(almost to himself)
Okay
(to an officer)
Well move “em to Corona Ill
lead the line

Bobby takes Rosarios hand as we GO TO
EXT MOTEL PARKING LOT

THREE CARS Burt in one heading the route Behind him is
Bobby and Rosarios car with guard Vitt behind the wheel
and the two of them in the back seat A third car has TWO
OFFICERS in it That vehicle trails the other two The
CARS DRIVE OFF

NOTE THE FOLLOWING SEQUENCE IS TO BE SHOT IN A MOSTLY
SUBJECTIVE WAY WITH THE EMPHASIS ON WITNESSING THE ACTION
AS OUR CHARACTERS WOULD

INT BOBBYS CAR

Bobby and Rosario are in the back seat She looks through
her pocketbook for some gum he remains focused on the view
through the windshield of his fathers car

Bobbys driver Vitt follows Burt down the streets RAIN
is FALLING frighteningly HARD to the point where the
windshield wipers arent moving fast enough for the water
on the windshield Upsetting Visibilitys terrible

The cars swing onto the Kosciusko Bridge loop The traffic
is sparse this early morning We HEAR the THUMPETY-THUMP
of the bridge beams and the windshield wipers And we HEAR
the steady haunting HUM of the bridge surface beneath the
wheels of the automobiles Bobby puts his arm around
Rosario in the back seat Re the rain

BOBBY GREEN
Its really coming down

ROSARIO DIAZ
Bobby--I think I left my watch at
the hotel--

Bobby does not answer instead spots an OLDSMOBILE driving
alongside his vehicle Seems a bit suspicious the way
its moving

BOBBY GREEN
Hey--Vitt--I think somethins on
our right

VITT THE GUARD
(TURNING)
Huh--

A FLASH

CRACK A BULLET punctures the windshield but we dont
HEAR the SHOT The hole SEEMS TO APPEAR almost out of
nowhere The windshield cracks down the middle

VITT IS HIT in the SHOULDER and he lets out a piercing
cry Blood hits the seat Rosario screams Bobby pushes
her head down into the back seat

THE CAR starts to swerve Bobby climbs awkwardly over to
the front seat Takes the WHEEL forcefully pulling Vitt

to the side To Rosario

BOBBY GREEN
Get down

Rosario crouches covers the back of her head with her
hands THE WATER gets pushed away by the speedy wipers
REVEALING BURTS CAR AND THE OLDSMOBILE HITTING EACH
OTHER SIDE TO SIDE THEN A HUBCAP--we dont know from
which car its been dislodged

COMES SPINNING AT INCREDIBLE SPEED AT BOBBYS WINDSHIELD
Right at BOBBY RIGHT AT US WE BLINK Bobby swerves

THE HUBCAP SKIDS OFF the front windshield Bobby brushes
up against the guardrail We SEE THAT IT is all that
protects him from spinning off into the river two hundred
feet below

Bobby darts from lane to lane and the THIRD POLICE CAR--
behind the Olds--has SLAMMED on its BRAKES to avoid hitting
Bobbys car

THE OLDS IS RIGHT NEXT TO BURTS CAR BOBBY SEES the
barrel of the gun swing to Burt

ANOTHER BIG PUDDLE--A MUFFLED THUNDERCLAP sound The
water slides away REVEALING that the back window of Burts
car has shattered

Bobby is startled at this his mouth momentarily drooping
open He CAN SEE

HIS FATHER FIRING his WEAPON out the window at the OLDS
We HEAR BURT through the RADIO a STATIC-RAVAGED SIGNAL

BURTS VOICE (RADIO FILTER)
They got a hit on Get support
now

Bobby pulls up alongside the Olds Looks inside He tries
to get a good look but cannot He SEES TWO people in the
car one driving and one doing the shooting--

BOOM And it punctures a hole in the side of Bobbys rear
door Rosario is JOLTED--screams again

BOBBY GREEN
Rosario You hurt

She shakes her head her face still buried in the vinyl
Shes hysterical--but physically unharmed

The traffic gets denser now The WEATHER is terrible
blinding Rushes of WATER COVER the glass around the car
wrecking visibility We ARE ON the BQE with many
trucks big and small on it

The Olds weaves in and out in front of and behind many
large semis BOBBY WATCHES AS Burts car is right behind
the Olds This is unbelievably dangerous

A TRUCK starts changing lanes The Olds scoots past it
before it does but Burt does not THE TRUCK CLIPS Burts
car on the drivers side He sneaks through recovering
and keeping up the pursuit

POLICE CARS SIRENS BLAZING JOIN THE PURSUIT

The truck starts to skid on the drenched roadway Then IT
JACKNIFES spinning out The Police Car behind Bobbys
slams into the truck making a MACABRE CRUNCHING SOUND

BOBBYS EYES as he turns around and witnesses the horrific
accident through the RAIN-SOAKED rear window It is
TERRIBLE

The truck CRUSHES the Police car its carriage flipping
over and flattening the vehicle and probably the people
inside

The Olds skids ferociously pulling off the expressway
toward city streets Burts car follows Burts car and
the Olds are neck-and-neck Bobby pulls up beside Burt
Into the radio

BOBBY GREEN (CONTD)
Pop lay back

But Burt does not Burt has a clear shot at the hooded man
in the back seat HE FIRES

A HIT We can see the BLOOD spatter the perps automobile
The mans head jerks back spasmodically We HEAR

BURTS VOICE (RADIO FILTER)
I got him I got the sonofabitch
AND THEN CLOSE SHOT ON BOBBY THREE QUICK CUTS CLOSER AND
CLOSERSILENCE He sees through the rain a LONG
SHOTGUN BARREL come out of the window from the rear
passengers seat area

His eyes pop The OLDS SPEEDS UP THE BARREL OF THE
SHOTGUN turns

WATER covers the windshield BLINDING the driver (and us)
The water slides off the glass

THEN A TERRIBLE THUNDERCLAP

BOBBY WATCHES as BLOOD COVERS BURTS FACE Hes been HIT
He loses control of the automobile Bobby freezes IN
DISBELIEF IN HORROR HIS FATHER HAS BEEN SHOT

EXT STREET

Through the RAIN we SEE a patch of parochial school
children ASIAN CHILDREN on the streetcorner

Bobbys car peels off away from danger Burts car IS
HEADED RIGHT FOR THEM In what seems like his dazed last
gasp he SLAMS on the BRAKES The car skids out spins
The motion is DIZZYING

THE OLDS is uncontrolled The vehicle moves through a
traffic light HITTING another car

STARTS TUMBLING NOT ON ITS SIDE BUT HEAD OVER TAIL

It is one intense image The car is upside down now It
slides for tens of feet before stopping Smoldering

The rain falls making an oddly serene sound We HEAR
SIRENS The Police are approaching

Burts car stops slowly He gets out of the car his face
a mess He stumbles for a few feet in the rain BOBBYS

CAR ARRIVES on the SCENE

BURTS EYES ARE RED filling with blood His JAW is open

TO

He gasps for air a vacant stare on his face His body
spasms Then he collapses on his knees FALLS FACE
DOWN IN A POOL OF BLOOD The Police are in the
background

WIDE SHOT of the BLOCK as BOBBY MOVES TO HIS FATHER WHO IS
LYING ON THE STREET Bobby bends down turning his father
over His fathers blood is all over his hands now

Burt is dead

Other cops surround them Bobby looks up at all of them
they at him Broken he pushes the others away As water
drips off his face

BOBBY GREEN
Dont fuckin look at him I said
dont--back up Dont look at
him

Bobby eyes his father spent crestfallen--but not
histrionic The CAMERA TILTS DOWN The BLOOD from BURTS
BODY flows into the street along the curbinto the gutter

DISSOLVE

INT POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Bobby and Rosario outside an office Armed cops are up
and down the hall We HEAR conversation through the walls
Bobby is standing smoking a cigarette holding back tears
Rosario is seated on a nearby bench--wet shivering
stunned Rosario looks to Bobby

ROSARIO DIAZ
Bobby Could I call my mother

Speechless Bobby nods Jack emerges from the office
approaches Michael

JACK SHAPIRO

They had to sedate him

These words hit Bobby His eyes close forcing tears
down
his cheeks

BOBBY GREEN

Michael turns to an OFFICER motions The officer leaves
The camera DOLLIES INTO a CLOSE SHOT of Bobby and we GO TO

INT JOSEPHS HOUSE - DEN

Sitting on the couch is Joseph He is trying to be stoic
but appears wan and tired Alone We HEAR the crowd in

the house but they are in the living room A KNOCK Bobby
enters

BOBBY GREEN
Joseph

Joseph eyes him seems heartened by the sight of his
brother But he is out of it emotionally bludgeoned
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
ITll catch ‘em Bobby Dont
worry

Bobby walks over to Joseph stands close to him Searches
for words Before he can speak

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONTD)
Theyre gonna need us to identify
the body

Then as emotional as weve yet seen him Bobby strains to
get the sentences out of his mouth

BOBBY GREEN

MEAN--
(BEAT)

Bobby breaks down Joseph responds by CLUTCHING him
tightly The brothers rock back and forth gently

INT FUNERAL HOME - DAY

The shot is of a small and bare room in a Queens funeral
home In the center is a COFFIN The camera DOLLIES
TOWARD IT Entering the room is an UNDERTAKER with Bobby
and Joseph right behind

UNDERTAKER
We know mere words cannot suffice
in this time of tragedy Were so
very sorry about your loss

The Undertaker unhinges the coffin Inside is Burt eyes
closed clothed in a suit We dont see the body what we
DO see are the reactions of his two sons Bobbys grief is
obvious but hes already seen him dead This is new
territory for Joseph who though he does not break down
seems overwhelmed Both young men nod in acknowledgement
and the Undertaker closes the coffin

UNDERTAKER (CONTD)
Now Im told youre going to be
handling the arrangements for
tomorrows service--

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
(DEVASTATED)
Thats right

UNDERTAKER

As the Undertaker leads Joseph away Bobby enters an

INT ANTECHAMBER

Where waiting are Jack and Michael Bobby gives a fiery
stare to the two cops He approaches them Sotto but
intense his teeth clenched in a simmering anger

BOBBY GREEN

After the funeral

Joseph turns and reenters the room with the coffin Bobby
WATCHES him from behind as his hand runs along the top of
the casket We HEAR

BRRRRRRRUUUMMM BRRRRRRRUUUUMMM BRRRRRRRUUUMMM
EXT INTERBORO CEMETERY - DAY

A LIMOUSINE pulls up against the backdrop of thousands of
tombstones Emerging are Bobby and Joseph They are both
wearing dark sunglasses Rosario and Sandra and the
children get out behind them and are led away by funeral
coordinators to another place in the coming processional
In the distance many many people and a long line of cars
move toward the two brothers

The Undertaker walks away briefly to direct some traffic
Bobby slowly puts his arm around Josephs waist prompting

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
Bobby Im real glad youre with
me now

BOBBY GREEN
Course

Joseph grows more emotional adjusts his sunglasses
Leans
to Bobby clears his throat Sotto
JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
You know I wasI was jealous of
you for a long time

Bobby is surprised to hear this admission and is taken
aback by the honesty of it--especially in this moment
Joseph grabs his brothers arm his voice cracking

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONTD)
I always did what Pop wanted
And you were free

Bobby tears up his voice breaking too he shakes his head
BOBBY GREEN
No I did it to hurt him I
disappointed him

Interrupting the moment the Undertaker approaches

UNDERTAKER
Gentlemen

The Undertaker guides the two men toward the procession
Just as the drums reach a THUNDEROUS VOLUME we GO TO

MINUTES LATER

A line of cars files into the cemetery led by the HEARSE
The procession is PHENOMENALLY LONG The New York skyline
is in the distance

UNIFORMED POLICE LINE the narrow road The COFFIN is
removed from the HEARSE put on WHEELS for the move to the
gravesite Bobby Joseph approach The DRUMS CONTINUE

BRRRRRRRUUUMMM BRRRRRRRUUUMMM BRRRRRRRUUUMMM

People get out of their cars Many of them we recognize
from elsewhere in the film but dont know by name One of
the people to emerge from a Town Car is MARAT BUZHAYEV and
his ever-present BABUSHKA WIFE KALINA

The walk begins with everyone saluting Bobby and Joseph

Behind them the Mayor the Commissioner all the rank and
file of the Force The turnout is enormous Rosario is
here too though several rows back She is with the women

Bobby peers at the procession which is made up of hundreds
of SALUTING COPS others AMONG THEM we SPOT

LOUIS FALSETTI

At that moment BOBBY SEES his old friend and the two make
EYE CONTACT Bobby is greatly moved by his appearance and
nods subtly to Jumbo Louis salutes gently a slight and
sympathetic smile coming across his face

SIMULTANEOUS Joseph takes a look at the COFFIN grows more
distraught He breaks down Bobby is there to catch him
and does

Several WHITE-GLOVED COPS move to help and then trying to
recompose himself he squeezes his brothers forearm for
support Tries to straighten

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
-Its all right Ill be all
right

Bobby is devastated by seeing his brother like this and is
momentarily rendered speechless He tightens his own grasp
around Joseph leads him on the walk behind the COFFIN

FURTHER DOWN THE PROCESSIONAL

Rosario Walking Eyeing the Cops the Cop Wives She
does not fit in Cops are staring at her She SEES COP
WIVES looking at her leaning over to each other and
TALKING ABOUT HER Though she cant hear what theyre
saying she is made to feel terribly uneasy

Rosario quickens her pace away from them and the MARCH
MOVES ON

EXT GRAVESITE

The line of police and relatives now heap dirt onto the
coffin which is in the ground BOBBY and JOSEPH silently
lead the line shoveling dirt and moving on Rosario moves
behind them Bobby SEES BEYOND THE CEMETARY GROUNDS
TEENAGERS have climbed the trees And theyre LAUGHING at
the spectacle Michael stands next to Bobby

A beat then Bobby speaks in a way thats preoccupied
Almost as if the words are more for himself than for Mike

BOBBY GREEN

Bobby eyes the Guard who promptly leaves the room He
places his drink on the coffee table
BOBBY GREEN

A TUSSLE As he tries to restrain her a torrent of
emotion explodes from Rosario

ROSARIO DIAZ (CONTD)

She breaks free Panting tears streaming down her cheeks
After a beat Bobby seeks to calm her

EXT PAN AMERICAN MOTOR INN - DAY
An UNMARKED CAR with Bobby inside pulls up to the front
GUARD steps forward to greet protects him

INT MOTEL ROOM

Bobby enters There are several guards in the space
Bobby scans the room and quickly notices EVERYTHING OF
ROSARIOS IS GONE Bobby wheels around to a GUARD
INTENSE EXPRESSION

BOBBY GREEN
What happened--whered she go

GUARD
She left about an hour ago She
said to give you this--

The GUARD hands Bobby a NOTE BOBBY SEES IT GRABS IT
WITHOUT READING IT

BOBBY GREEN
We gotta go find her

GUARD
She asked us not to Bobby Shes--
Bobby--we cant do that legally

Bobby tries to charge past them The Guards all restrain
him delicately (Cmon calm down) but Bobby is in no
mood and instead starts a melee He is a tour de force of
energy and it takes no less than everyone here to subdue
him The FIGHT is more a WRESTLING MATCH than anything
else and it is messy tough

BOBBY GREEN
DON T--FUCKIN --

Bobbys forehead is cut the struggle is UGLY The Guards
rouse up enough strength to PUSH HIM into the HOTEL ROOM
for GOOD THE DOOR SLAMS A SILENT BEAT Bobby paces in
a rage Then sarcastic

BOBBY GREEN (CONTD)
Go “head Keep me in here--KEEP ME
HERE

GUARDS VOICE (MUFFLED)
Bobby we dont wanna have to put
you in restraints so just calm
down
(BEAT)
Calm the fuck down

Bobby stares at the door

BOBBY GREEN
You gonna keep me here HUH

Still in a fury he takes a lamp and HITS THE DOOR
REPEATEDLY Then he HURLS the lamp toward a mirror on the
wall AND IT SHATTERS Exhausted he stops Moves to

INT BEDROOM

Where he sits on the edge of the bed touches his neck
BLOOD on his hand He STILL GRIPS THE UNREAD NOTE He
throws it to the ground and then perhaps motivated by the
realization of his situation a flood of feeling comes over
him Tears begin to fall down his face and he succumbs

It is as though all of the emotions in our story find their
outlet here in this moment Bobby lets all the remaining

feeling drain from him until he has nothing left

After this outburst he is exhausted He calms breathing
heavily A beat he puts his bloodied hand to his head

We PRELAP the SOUND of a PHONE RINGING

INT QUEENS BAR - PHONE BOOTH
A noisy Queens place its blue collar patrons watching
boxing on the television and cheering PAN OVER TO one of
those old in-the-wall phone booths with a sliding door
Bobby is on the phone seated in the dark space Holds a
GLASS half-full of LIQUOR Distraught he listens for an
answer as the PHONE RINGS once more Then

A MANS VOICE (PHONE FILTER)
Hello

A BEAT Bobby collects himself Then

BOBBY GREEN

LOUIS FALSETTI (PHONE FILTER)

standing in the crowd behind the seated audience Her face
is partially obscured BOBBY CANNOT BELIEVE THE FLOOD OF
EMOTION that overwhelms him the happiness he feels upon
catching a glimpse of her

But just as quickly as this thrill grabs him it disappears
when she becomes completely visible for he realizes that
IT IS NOT HER but rather a young woman who bears merely a
faint resemblance Joseph interrupts this leans over

JOSEPH GRUSINSKY
I love you Bobby

BOBBY GREEN
(back to reality)
Love you too Joe

Police line up on the stage Everyones seated Bobby and
Joseph in front The POLICE BAND begins to play the drums
