A WOMAN’S PERFECTLY-MANICURED HAND

Writes in a notebook - adding items to a CHECKLIST
“Sunday” is written atop the page with perfect penmanship
Below is a meticulous “To-Do List” starting with “Stretch”
Beside each item is a BOX just waiting to be checked-off
INT CALLIE’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAWN

Our list-maker CALLIE BEZOS 30s as tightly wound as her
ponytail’s scrunchie STRETCHES on the floor in her workout
clothes As she pulls her hand up her leg she stops half-
way Discovering--

CUT BACK TO THE LIST

“SHAVE LEGS” is squeezed into the middle of the CHECKLIST

INT CALLIE’S APARTMENT - SPOTLESS BATHROOM - MORNING

Callie sits on the toilet perusing the REAL ESTATE SECTION
of the San Francisco Chronicle

CUT BACK TO THE LIST
With a flourish a perfect 45-degree-angle check mark is

made in the box next to “BUSINESS MEETING”

EXT STREET - MORNING

Callie SINGS along with her iPod as she runs “Stay (I Miss
You)” by Lisa Loeb never sounded so off-key or out of breath

CALLIE
You say I only hear what I want
to And you say I talk so all
the time--

Callie turns the corner to find a steep-ass San Francisco
HILL Without hesitation she turns and runs the other way

CALLIE (CONTD)
So

CUT BACK TO THE LIST

“RUN” is checked off her list
INT CALLIE’S APARTMENT - SPOTLESS BATHROOM - MORNING

Callie strips off her clothes and hops into an already
steaming shower After a ridiculously short beat

The WATER SHUTS OFF Callie reaches out and grabs a towel--

CUT BACK TO THE LIST

“QUICK SHOWER” and () “SHAVE LEGS” are checked off her list
Callie’s hand moves down to “PERFECT MATCH APPOINTMENT” and--

INT PERFECT MATCH OFFICES - DAY

Beneath a large LOGO is the company’s slogan “Because
Professional Women Deserve a Professional Matchmaker”

Callie sits across from her PROFESSIONAL MATCHMAKER one of
those women in their 50s who always tell you they’re 39

PROFESSIONAL MATCHMAKER
So tell me about your date

CALLIE
Well honestly Margot I was
pretty disappointed

PROFESSIONAL MATCHMAKER
What happened Did he get fresh
Did he try and touch your boob--

CALLIE
No

PROFESSIONAL MATCHMAKER
Your baby chute Did he go for the--

CALLIE
What No Who calls it that--

PROFESSIONAL MATCHMAKER
Because we do not allow that kind
of thing on the first date--

CALLIE
He didn’t touch my “baby chute”
okay He didn’t touch anything

PROFESSIONAL MATCHMAKER
Oh
CALLIE
No I didn’t want him to touch me

PROFESSIONAL MATCHMAKER
No sparks huh It happens Not to
worry though We’ve got 50 more
“Perfect Matches” in our database
just waiting to meet you

CALLIE
Right Look I really appreciate
everything you’ve done But I just
don’t think this is working out

PROFESSIONAL MATCHMAKER
Not working out Sweetheart this
was only your third date with us
Finding a Perfect Match takes time

CALLIE
Listen I’d really rather not get
into this But you had me give you
a list of qualities I was looking
for when I signed up--

PROFESSIONAL MATCHMAKER
And we’ve matched almost every one

CALLIE
Okay first I’m not sure taking
business trips to Detroit means you
“like to travel” And second your
service isn’t called Almost Match
It’s called Perfect Match

PROFESSIONAL MATCHMAKER
Are you accusing me of something

CALLIE
No I mean maybe a poorly
conceived marketing campaign but--

PROFESSIONAL MATCHMAKER
Because I’m a third generation
matchmaker I’ve been doing this 20
years I have personally introduced
over 200 married couples I’m the
best at this okay And I’ve got
news for you honey that man you
went out with Jacob--

CALLIE
Steve--
PROFESSIONAL MATCHMAKER
Steve Steve’s a great guy And
maybe if you weren’t so concerned
with him checking all the boxes on
that little list of yours you
might have noticed that

CALLIE
Yes I’m sure Steve and his Steely
Dan record collection will make
some woman very happy one day but--

PROFESSIONAL MATCHMAKER
Oh now you have a problem with
Steely Dan You know what I don’t
have time for difficult people
Because you know what happens to
difficult people sweetheart They
end up alone Forever Okay

CALLIE
(sotto)
Perfect Match appointment - check

INT TWO MILLION DOLLAR PACIFIC HEIGHTS’ LISTING - DAY

Callie walks through the empty house on her cell phone

CALLIE
Rodolfo I love you If you weren’t
married I’d kiss you right now
(her face drops)
Oh god The bird Rodolfo no What
is the bird still doing here

She stares in horror at the kitchen’s back window which

features a giant STAINED GLASS TOUCAN

CALLIE (CONTD)
Yes It was on the list I--

But she’s cut off by the DOORBELL Too late

INT PACIFIC HEIGHTS LISTING - TEN MINUTES LATER

Wearing her patented “smile that sold a thousand homes”
Callie leads a cute middle-aged GAY COUPLE down the hall

CALLIE
--and you know the best part about
this place This is not a house
BOTH GUYS
It isn’t

CALLIE
No see houses are a dime a dozen
A roof a couple of walls coat of
paint This This is a home

The guys smile Putty in her hands But then--

GAY MAN 2
Is this the kitchen in here

CALLIE
Actually the kitchen isn’t ready--

GAY MAN 2
I just want to see it

GAY MAN 1
He loves to entertain

And before Callie can say anything else in they go and--

GAY MAN 2
Jesus Mary and Joseph

GAY MAN 1
Oh my god Look at that thing It’s
hideous

CALLIE
Believe me I know It’s awful But
well have it replaced by--

GAY MAN 2

GAY MAN 1

a whole like tropical tiki
breakfast nook thing in here

GAY MAN 2

Callie smiles making a big fat check mark in her mind

CALLIE
I mean how could you not
EXT PACIFIC HEIGHTS HOUSE - DAY
Callie walks down the front steps on her CELLPHONE

CALLIE
l understand that mom But if I
tell you the now the news really
won’t be much of a surprise
(seeing a cab)
Hey taxi TAXI

Callie runs into the street after it But the cab ZIPS by

CALLIE (CONTD)
Yes I was yelling “taxi” at you
mother I thought it might be fun
if I started pointing out things I
see while we talk No I don’t
think sarcasm is what’s keeping me
from finding a boyfriend This is
ridiculous I’1ll be there in five
minutes Goodbye mom

As she puts her phone in her purse it falls off her shoulder

EXT PACIFIC AVENUE - STREET - SIMULTANEOUS

A green and white “Cullen Crew Taxi Cab” flies around the
corner - “Bullit” style It heads right for CALLIE who bends
down to pick up her purse She turns just in time to see--

RRRRRRR The cab SCREECHES to a halt inches from Callie’s
face She STUMBLES and FALLS backward A beat then

GUY (0S)
Oh my god Are you all right

CALLIE
Jesus Step off the gas asshole

Callie looks up to see PATRICK CULLEN 30 the only cabbie on
the planet wearing designer jeans staring down at her

PATRICK
I’m so sorry I don’t usually drive
like that It’s just- My brothers
and I- We’re on our way to the
Niner game and we have this race-
And the last one there has to wipe
my dad’s ass tonight and- Right
let me back up a second
CALLIE
No please go on

PATRICK
Did I mention I was sorry

CALLIE
You know I bet your boss would
love to hear about this

PATRICK
Yeah see my boss is my dad so--

CALLIE
Thank god for family

PATRICK
Listen could I maybe give you a
ride somewhere Make it up to you

Patrick puts on his most winning smile and offers his hand

CALLIE
Well I guess it’s probably safer
in your car than out here on my ass
in front of it huh

INT PATRICKS CAB - DRIVING - DAY

Patrick pulls over But Callie doesnt notice she’s buried
in her NOTEBOOK compiling another one of her to-do lists--

PATRICK
Sowere you planning on getting
out or is this like a “Collateral”
situation where I drive you around
and you shoot a bunch of people

CALLIE
(finally looking up)
Excuse me

PATRICK
Is that what you’ve got in that
notebook Your “hit list”

CALLIE
Something like that

Patrick watches in the rearview mirror as Callie studies the
house across the street
PATRICK
You need help with your bag or--

CALLIE
I’m fine Just preparing for the
ninth circle of hell Let me ask
you something does your mom like
brunch And by brunch I mean
drinking mimosas and explaining to
you why you’re still single

PATRICK
My mom died actually

CALLIE
Shit I’m sorry

PATRICK
It’s okay It’s been 12 years

CALLIE
When I was six my mom wouldn’t let
me be “Annie” for Halloween because
“she came from a broken home”

PATRICK
Sounds like a real sweetheart

CALLIE
Oh yeah she’s the best Imagine
Bill O’Reilly Only wearing a
blouse from Ann Taylor Loft

PATRICK
Okay now I’m getting aroused
(she laughs and then)
So this may seem like a stupid
question but If you hate her so
much why come at all

CALLIE
Well she makes great scones

They share a parting smile as Callie gets out and trudges up
to her mother’s door Patrick starts to pull away when

He spots Callie’s NOTEBOOK Sitting on the back seat

EXT CALLIE’S MOTHER’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Callie rings the door bell just as Patrick starts running up
the steps behind her with the notebook
PATRICK
Hey you forgot your--

Callie looks back just as the FRONT DOOR OPENS revealing her
mother HELENA 60 with a hairdo you can set your watch to

HELENA
Jesus Where have you been I--
(she spots Patrick)
Oh Well this is a surprise

CALLIE
Oh no mom this-—-

HELENA
Were you going to introduce us Or
should I just stand here with my
hand out like a panhandler

Callie freezes Her Sunday about to get even worse Except--

PATRICK
Hi Patrick Cullen ma’am What a
pleasure it is to finally meet you

HELENA
Nice to meet you Patrick Well
don’t just stand there Come in
Oh and Callie in the future If
you could tell me your “surprise”
requires an extra place setting
It’s called common courtesy

Helena heads inside and Patrick quickly turns to Callie--

PATRICK
Okay life story in 30 seconds Go

CALLIE
What- What are you doing

PATRICK
Let’s just say I know what it’s
like to have a demanding family

Callie looks at him like he’s crazy but
PATRICK (CONTD)
So what’ya think We’ve been going

out what Maybe two months

She smiles And our newly minted fake couple heads in trying
to cram 2 months of “getting to know you” into a few seconds

HELENA (PRE-LAP)
So how did you two meet

INT HELENA’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY
Without missing a beat Patrick takes Callie’s hand and--

PATRICK
Do you want to tell it or should I

CALLIE
Uhh Why don’t you

PATRICK
She always makes me tell it Even
though I know she’ll spend half the
story correcting me on the details
This guy knows what I’m talking
about Am I right

Patrick motions across the table to PETROS Callie’s stepdad
60s a bushy eyebrow’ed man of few words He barely blinks

Suddenly Patrick’s PHONE ERUPTS Nirvana’s “Rape Me” blares
He scrambles to silence it but instead hits SPEAKER PHONE--

KEVIN (ON THE PHONE)
(in the background)
Hold still pussy

SEAMUS (ON THE PHONE)
(in the background)
Eat me old man

LIAM (ON THE PHONE)
Dude Patty where are you man
Kev’s about to knock a beer can--

A PAINED YELP is heard before Patrick finally cuts off the
call mortified Everyone stares at him It’s awkward

PATRICK
Right so that was my brothers
Those three I tell ya what they
love a little good-natured hijinks

HELENA
Oh How much younger are they

PATRICK
I’m actually the youngest

ANYWAY so back to the story
(MORE)

PATRICK (CONTD)
About a month ago I’m down at Pier
39 buying some fish to feed the sea
lions and there across the bait
shop is this This vision--

Helena’s face scrunches up - ‘feeding fishto sea lions’

CALLIE
Uhh He’s just kidding mom--

PATRICK
See I told you she’d correct me

HELENA
My god Why on Earth would you kid
about something like that

CALLIE
Because we uh we met We met--

PATRICK

a little embarrassed about it--

HELENA
You met on the computer

PETROS
I see Dateline last week ‘bout men
who meet young girls in chat room
on computer These girls they
very very young--

HELENA
Petros please You’re not helping

Petros shuts up Another very awkward beat until

PATRICK

Listen Miss

(realizing he doesn’t know

her last name)
-Assumptions are often made about
online dating I mean believe me
I was skeptical too But ma’am
when I met your daughter

Patrick turns and looks into Callie’s eyes - it’s convincing

PATRICK (CONTD)
and I learned just how beautiful
and smart and feisty and funny she
was I don’t know

(MORE)

PATRICK (CONTD)

All I could think was thank god
for online dating Because without
it how would I have ever met this
extraordinary woman You know

Callie and Helena both look ready to melt Even Petros looks
moved Patrick coolly picks up a scone and takes a bite--

PATRICK (CONTD)
These are great scones by the way

INT PATRICK’S CAB - LATER
Callie and Patrick sit in the cab outside her apartment

INT CALLIE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

drain Your mother will be crushed
when she hears the news

CALLIE

Up here

A long beat The Cop eyes the brothers Then Callie
COP

back to the hospital immediately

Callie nods her assurance The Cop turns to the brothers and--

SALUTES them They all look confused except Seamus who
salutes back covering his package with his other hand

INT CULLEN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATE NIGHT

The decor is an 80’s time warp But a small table in the
corner stands out - it’s a SHRINE to the boys’ MOTHER

An ORCHID is surrounded by FRAMED PHOTOS Mom and Dad Mom
with the boys at various ages And the last one the whole
Cullen crew at Christmas - Patrick can’t be older than 18

ON THE COUCH Callie and the brothers watch their video of

LIAM
Exactly Thank you And that makes
this the hand of victory And the
hand of victory can’t hear your
cries for justice bro It can only
hear its adoring fans

He waves his hand toward his ear a la Hulk Hogan

LIAM (CONTD)
And the hand of victory would also
like to point out the girl who made
this all possible The silver-
tongued vixen The Duchess of BS
The girl that saved all our white
Irish asses tonight Miss Callie

Liam raises Callie’s hand triumphantly Beaming Patrick
turns to a quiet Kevin - usurped as the center of attention

PATRICK
So What’ya think

Hurt Patrick watches as Kevin gets up and heads outside

INT PATRICK’S CAB - DRIVING - DAWN
Callie looks over - Patrick’s clearly stewing over Kevin

change After the Niners traded Joe
Montana he swore off the team for
two years He refused to even say
Steve Young’s name out loud until
after he won the Super Bowl

CALLIE
Great so all I have to do is win
the Super Bowl

PATRICK
He just needs to spend some more
time around you That’s all And
hey if it’s any consolation I
think you’re kind of okay

CALLIE
(cracking a smile)

--as the scene continues we INTERCUT BETWEEN THE CABS--

KEVIN
Different Yeah heard that one
Face it bro you’re just like me
Every girl’s like a carton of milk

(MORE)

KEVIN (CONTD)
Only difference is you act like a
fucking lactose intolerant half the
time and I’m out there drinking
fresh milk every morning but--

PATRICK
I’m serious this time Kev Callie
she’s like My best friend

KEVIN
Did you- Did you just say--

LIAM
(high-pitched lovey voice)
Oh Callie when I look into your
eyes I see My future

SEAMUS
(even higher-pitched)

Oh Patrick it feels like magic
when your lips touch mine Your
skin tastes like wild berries so
sweet and pure I want you to hold
me and rock me through the night
Take away all my pain Make me

Seamus trails off He looks at the weirded-out PASSENGER in
the back seat Come to think of it ALL THE BROTHERS have
FARES And none of them seem thrilled to be hearing all this

SEAMUS (CONTD)
What Was my voice not high enough

INT HOUSE - GLENN PARK - DAY - A FEW MONTHS LATER

Callie and Patrick climb a narrow staircase that CREAKS with
every step They move up to the house’s main floor

CALLIE
It was just a mouse Calm down

PATRICK
That was not “just a mouse” That
thing was big enough to open its
own theme park

CALLIE
It’s on the list Rodolfo hasn’t
even been over here yet

PATRICK
So when do you start showing it
Couple weeks A month

CALLIE

Actually I kind of already am
Right now

(Patrick freezes)
Look I never thought this’d happen
either But then you came along
mowed me down with your car stole
my heart And here we are ya know
I’m happier than I’ve ever been
before You’re my best friend
Patrick I love you

PATRICK
And I love you too--

CALLIE
--But

PATRICK

There’s no “but” I love you

It’s just- Okay there’s a “but”
See if we move in together pretty
soon you’ll wanna get married and--

CALLIE
--Well yeah sure but that
doesn’t have to happen right away--

PATRICK
--let me finish--

CALLIE
--I mean I know I’m always
complaining about my mom’s nagging
but I’m not in a rush or anything--

PATRICK
Callie I can’t get married
(this shuts her up then)
I mean I can’t- I’m not really
allowed to get married until my
brothers do And I know that sounds-—

CALLIE
Ridiculous

PATRICK
Did I mention my family is crazy

CALLIE
Yeah You have But you never
mentioned that apparently youre
all living in a bad 1950’s musical

PATRICK
It’s my mom See before she passed
away we all promised her--

CALLIE
You promised your mom That you
wouldn’t get married

PATRICK
Right Okay My mom had this
older sister my Aunt Noreen And
Noreen never got married The woman
spent her whole life alone with her
pugs And when my mom got sick she
started to feel guilty about it
She got it in her head that it was
her fault ya know Because she ran
off with my dad so young I guess
she wanted to make sure the same
thing didn’t happen to one of us

Callie lets this all sink in for a beat Then

CALLIE
So you just can’t get married yet

PATRICK
Well yeah technically But you
know my brothers They’re not
exactly the marrying type

CALLIE
Well sure not now Right now
they’re train wrecks But Maybe

I could you know help them

PATRICK
Help them Oh Cal no Not a--

CALLIE
All they need is some female
guidance A few dating tips Make-
overs Definitely make-overs I can
introduce them to the right girls

Callie digs in her purse and grabs her TO-DO LIST NOTEBOOK--

PATRICK
What are you doing

CALLIE
I don’t want to forget any of this

PATRICK
Callie--

CALLIE
Patrick I’ve spent my whole life
helping people find the perfect
place to live It’s basically the
same thing I can do this

(off his look)

You know what I find your lack of
faith disturbing

PATRICK
Didyou just quote Darth Vader

CALLIE
You gonna help me or not buddy

Callie gives Patrick a big smile - no idea what she’s in for

TIGHT ON CALLIE’S HAND

As she starts a new checklist in her notebook this one
entitled “Fixing Up the Cullen Brothers” Pull out--

INT TRENDY NOE VALLEY SALON - DAY

Callie writes while her hair is examined by ERIN 30s long and
layered on opinions buzz-cut short with the sugar coating

ERIN
so we all tell him it’s a
terrible idea But Emmett’s the
kinda guy who takes advice from
fortune cookies So he gets the
monkey anyway He’s convinced he
can house train the thing Fast
forward to six months later the
girlfriend is gone and ole Chimpy
is still crapping on the couch

CALLIE
I’m not training monkeys Erin--

ERIN
No you’re worse You think you can
tame the whole flippin’ jungle

PATRICK
On behalf of my entire family
thank you for that flattering
metaphor

Yep Patrick’s at the next station getting his hair cut by--

LAYLA
Come on I think it’s romantic

Callie gives Erin an “I told you so” look Then again LAYLA
late 20s is the bright-eyed kind of girl who--

ERIN
Yeah this from the girl who can
recite every detail of every “Sex
and the City” episode ever made

LAYLA
I can not

ERIN
Really What was the name of the
guy Carrie sets Miranda up with in
the first episode--

LAYLA CALLIE PATRICK

The girls all look at Patrick - Whoops

PATRICK
What I happened to see that one

LAYLA
He’s even a bad liar

CALLIE
I told you He’s the total package

PATRICK
(stopping Layla)
Whoa whoa I don’t want too much
off the top I want it more like
layered you know

Callie smiles and looks at Erin Finally

ERIN
Okay fine he’s great we get it
You wanna play matchmaker at the
circus First thing you gotta do is
observe these guys while they’re
sniffing around some females You
know study their mating habits

PATRICK
Seriously I’m sitting right here

LAYLA
Look look He’s even cute when
he’s pretending to be angry

INT SHITTY IRISH DIVE BAR - NIGHT

“Cullen’s Criie” is painted on the head of a bass DRUM Sticks

LIAM
You say I only hear what I
want to And you say
I talk so all the time So

Callie watches at the bar with ROY the brothers’ soon to be
70-year-old father who is presently nursing a pint of beer

CALLIE
Oh my god I love this song

ROY
Not for long you won’t

ON STAGE Kevin picks out the song’s opening GUITAR riff And
as Patrick’s BASS joins the fray - BOOM The band kicks into
a face-melting version of Lisa Loeb’s “Stay (I Miss You)”

LIAM
I thought what I felt was simple
And I thought that I dont belong
And now that you are leaving I
know that I did something wrong

Cuz I missed you
Liam rips the MIC out of the stand for effect before--

LIAM (CONTD)
Yeah I missed you

Callie’s face says it all they may be spirited but--
ROY
God they suck You can blame their
Partridge Family-loving mother

CALLIE
Come on they sound Okay

ROY
They sound like rush hour traffic

ON STAGE Liam kicks them into the next verse and

Roy’s right they do kind of sound like rush hour downtown

ROY (CONT’D)
God love her but Lil was deaf
dumb and blind around those boys
It was one hair-brained idea after
another when we were raising them

CALLIE
Yeah Patrick was telling me about
the whole “Marriage Pact”

ROY

Christ that one took the cake
That woman and her damn
“philosophies” Never knew whatd
come out of her mouth next But you
know what Dammit if she wasn’t
right just about every time She
knew what was best for those boys
Better than anyone ever will
(Callie clams up then)
See love is kinda like the Johnny
Carson Show And in our marriage
Lilly was Carson I was Ed McMahon
My job was to sit there on that
couch and agree with everything she
said Laugh at her jokes Help her
out with whatever she needed And
you know why Cuz she was the
best in the god damn business

Roy washes down his wisdom with the remainder of his beer

ROY (CONT’D)
‘Course now that she’s gone all I
got left are those yahoos up there
screaming like a couple of raccoons
makin’ babies in the dumpster

Callie LAUGHS and so does Roy as the Criie keeps wailing away

He’s probably a little nervous with
all this butter around

SEAMUS

(an awkward beat then)
Some people think lobsters are
cannibals But that’s only half
true They usually feed on clams
and mussels But sometimes if
they’re really hungry they’1l eat
tinier lobsters too

Seamus smiles proud of himself But the girls look confused

CALLIE
Uh Seamus weren’t you telling
me that lobsters mate for life

Actually that’s a myth--

NATALIA
Oh my god you’re right Remember

up long enough and they might
actually come across as semi-
normal Pretty soon the girls get
their hooks into ‘em And by the
time either one of them figures it
out it’ll be too late

CALLIE
You’re such a romantic

KEVIN
Do you want this to work or not

You don’t think they’re moving a
little fast

Patrick catches the ball from Liam and relays it home Then

PATRICK
What Because she showed him some

“The Drive - Standing on the Sidelines of Super Bowl XXIII”

LIAM (CONTD)
Kev got it signed by everyone from
the “The Drive” Well except Joe

SEAMUS
(a sore spot)
Yeah except Joe

CALLIE
What’s “The Drive”

LIAM
Bite your tongue woman
PATRICK
Come on Cal Niners-Bengals Super

Bowl 23

Callie shrugs The brothers stare at her incredulous
Then For what sounds like the 1000th time it begins

KEVIN
310 on the clock Down by three
Niners have to go 92 yards They
need a miracle
PATRICK
-they need Joe Montana

KEVIN
To calm everyone in the huddle Joe
looks up into the stands points at
someone in the crowd and says--

SEAMUS
“Hey isn’t that John Candy”

KEVIN
Bam First play’s a pass to Craig
in the flat out to the 16

INTERCUT WITH actual NFL Films footage of the game

PATRICK
He dumps to Franks over the middle
Then hits Rice down the sideline
out of bounds near midfield

SEAMUS
Craig out of the backfield again
and they’re into Bengal territory
Then second and forever Joe finds
Rice streaking across the middle

Liam starts jumping up and down he’s getting so pumped--

LIAM
Jerry “fucking” Rice man Guy
avoids three Bengal defenders and
sneaks inside the 20 Then 52
seconds left Joe finds Craig one
more time Down to the ten

KEVIN
And then it happened 39 seconds
left Bill Walsh calls the last
play of his NFL coaching career

PATRICK
Twenty halfback curl X-up

KEVIN

Last ten yards in the red zone are
the hardest But Joe Montana’s John
Wayne And John Wayne never loses
He’s making that throw

LIAM SEAMUS PATRICK
He’s making that throw

KEVIN
Everyone in the place has their
eyes glued to Rice but not Joe
Because he knows John Taylor’s got
a step on his man And Boom In
stride Right in his hands Back of
the end zone Touchdown 49ers

He raises his arms skyward just like Montana - Victory All
the brothers beam like it just happened

KEVIN (CONT’D)
January 22 1989 Best day of my
life And there’s not even a
close second

Off Callie’s look just staring in awe

INT PATRICK’S CAB - DRIVING - NIGHT
Seamus and Liam are back at it - bickering in the back seat--

SEAMUS
That’s what I’m asking you How is
she out of my league

LIAM
Youre way too short for her
That’s just a scientific fact man

SEAMUS
I’m not short I’m taller than you

LIAM
Please Besides it doesn’t matter
She’s too hot too And too
athletic And she probably listens
to way sweeter music

SEAMUS
Well Layla’s way too hot for you
And too nice And too awesome

Callie sticks her head in the back eyeing the two of them

CALLIE
On the count of three I want both
of you to say the name of the girl

LIAM
How about another big hand for the
birthday boy Mister Roy Cullen
(APPLAUSE and then)
I wanted to play one more song if
I could A new song actually It’s
dedicated to a very special lady

the guitar with the GUITAR RIFF we heard earlier--

Sipping her wine Callie searches the rows of cars for
Patrick’s cab Finally she spots it As she approaches

LAUGHING and WHISPERING can be heard It’s coming from the--

BACKSEAT Patrick is fooling around withXavier the Valet

Callie drops her wine glass and it shatters on the ground
Patrick turns to see her Crestfallen He fumbles to get out
of the car as she takes off--

PATRICK
Cal Callie wait

Trying to run in her heels Callie takes a bad stepand
TAKES A SPILL to the GROUND This allows Patrick to catch up
just as she starts to cry--

CALLIE

Jesus Christ How could I be so
stupid I mean what cab driver on
Earth wears designer jeans

PATRICK
Cal I didn’t know I- I--

(a beat)
Has this happened--

PATRICK
Once One other time But--

CALLIE
I can’t be here I have to go I
have to get out of here--

PATRICK

It was six years ago And I got so
freaked out afterward I thought it

(and then)
You know my family Cal You know

think would happen if I told them
I tried to make it easier For
them For me It just seemed easier-

CALLIE
Well I am so glad this was easy

Roy drunkenly waves her over to the bar No way out

ROY (CONT’D)

The bartender hands Callie her bourbon and she takes a BELT
ROY (CONT’D)

Patty of ours happier And that’s
the god’s honest truth

Another stomach punch All Callie can do is FINISH her DRINK

INT RAMADA - BALLROOM - TWO DRINKS LATER

Callie’s planted in the same spot downing more BOURBON - at
least a sheet and a half to the wind Her eyes are fixed on--

THE DANCE FLOOR the brothers DANCE up a storm with their
girlfriends All her work a

CALLIE
Big fucking success - check

Kevin spots her watching excuses himself and walks over

KEVIN
Hey Why aren’t you dancing
CALLIE
Your brother and I We decided to

sit this one out
Kevin nods not really sure what to make of that Then

KEVIN
Listen I’m a little buzzed right
now so I’m sure I’m gonna regret
telling you this but I just
wanted to say thank you

CALLIE
Thank you

KEVIN
For everything you’ve done for us
For me I guess I kinda needed
someone to come along and pry my
head out of my ass you know No
one’s really been around to do
that Since my mom

Despite all the pain and all the booze Callie is touched
KEVIN (CONTD)

And it made me realize some stuff
Kinda see the light I guess

(and then)
Okay so don’t tell anyone this
but uh I was thinking of asking

Ramy to move in together Got a
whole special dinner thing planned
after the Niner game next week

Callie’s face drops even a rung lower than before

CALLIE
Kevin that is sogreat

KEVIN
You think so I wasn’t sure if
maybe it was too soon or--

CALLIE
No it’s great I’m happy for you

KEVIN
Thanks

He hugs her One of those buzzed hugs that goes a beat or two
long - a definite moment The look on Callie’s face says she
doesn’t want it to end But of course it does

They share a smile before Kevin heads back to the dance floor
to find Ramy Callie downs the rest of her bourbon

INT RAMADA - BALLROOM - ON STAGE - TWO MORE DRINKS LATER

Roy proudly holds up his new framed 70 49ERS JERSEY for the
room to see “Cullen” has been stitched on the back

MIC in hand Patrick stands next to him smiling
PATRICK
We decided we’d put it behind
glass so you couldn’t spill beer
all over this one

This draws a BIG LAUGH from the room And then

PATRICK (CONTD)
Here’s to the best dad four

brothers could ask for To Roy
ALL
To Roy
CALLIE
(a beat late and too loud)
TO ROY

Patrick turns to see Callie stumbling on stage You don’t
need me to tell you that she has another bourbon in her hand

PATRICK
(shielding the mic)
What are you doing

CALLIE
I want to say something

She tries to pry the mic out of his hand--

PATRICK
Callie stop--

ROY
Come on let her talk Patty

LIAM
Yeah get off the stage bro

Callie rips the MIC out of Patrick’s hand causing a SCREECH
of FEEDBACK People CLAP and Callie does a drunken curtsy

CALLIE
Thank you thank you Now I
probably don’t need to tell you all
that Roy Cullen is a very smart
man And you know he once told
me He said Love Love is like
the Johnny Carson Show Well
Roy Heeeeeere’s Callie--

Callie SNORTS at her joke swaying drunkenly back and forth

CALLIE (CONTD)

Id like to start- I’d like to
start with a song if I could And
this one Goes out To you

(she points at Kevin and

then very off-key)
You say I only hear what I
want to And you say I
talk so all the time So

She stops Everyone looks as concerned as Patrick now

CALLIE (CONTD)
So Maybe I’m not the best
singer But I know things Things
about you guys Secrets Shhhhh

PATRICK
That’s enough Callie--

CALLIE
Enough Enough Come on I’m just
getting started For instance
did you know that Liam only dates
girls who have names in rock songs

In the crowd Liam plays it off with a smile to Bridgett

CALLIE (CONTD)
Or Seamus Seamus’11 only go out
with a girl if she’s even weirder
and more fucked up than he is

PATRICK
Give me the microphone Callie--

CALLIE
But I haven’t even told them your
secret yet Patty And boy does
he got a doozy See about an hour
ago I found him messing around in
the parking lot with the valet
PS The valet was a dude

Kevin takes a few steps toward the stage

KEVIN
All right that’s enough--

CALLIE

Oh and Kevin We can’t forget
Kevin Here’s a guy who- Who asked
his soon-to-be live-in girlfriend -
sorry spoiler alert He only asked
her for her number because of a bet
he made with his brothers And
then He shoves the number in my
face to prove what a man he is Oh

Helena pushes past Patrick and grabs Callie by the arm--

HELENA
We’re going home now

CALLIE
Fine We’ll go I’m going There’s
nothing left for me here anyway

The microphone slams to the ground - more horrible FEEDBACK
Helena tries to take Callie’s arm to guide her off-stage

CALLIE (CONT’D)
I don’t need your help Mom I can
walk on my own okay

On cue she stumbles but regains her balance just in time

CALLIE (CONT’D)
See I’m perfectly--

--But that’s when Callie keels over and PUKES all over her
mother’s shoes

CALLIE (CONTD)
fine

Off a SEA OF ANGRY FACES staring in disgust at our girl

INT HELENA’S HOUSE - GUEST BEDROOM - DAY

A towering half-empty bottle of water sits on the night
stand next to a jar of Advil and a plate filled with toast
crumbs Below it ON THE FLOOR is a--

PURSE its contents spilling out onto the rug A tampon tube
of lipstick and pack of gum form a trail that lead to a--

GARBAGE CAN that has been strategically placed below the--

HEAD OF CALLIE hanging precariously off the side of the bed
A jumbled mess of blankets cover the rest of her body

Her eyes open - bloodshot weary And she GROANS

INT HELENA’S HOUSE - GUEST BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Callie splashes her face with water from the sink in vain no
Noxema girl refreshment to be found She looks up and sees a

CHECKLIST taped to the mirror that reads

“Before you leave today please Make Bed Put Advil back
in the Cabinet Hang Up Your Wet Towel Put Plate in the
Dishwasher Collect All Your Belongings Thanks Mom

Yes thanks Mom indeed

INT HELENA’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - LATER

Callie plops down in a chair at the table across from Petros
who chuckles at whatever Marmaduke is up to this morning

HELENA
So nice of you to join us in the
land of the living dear
(handing her COFFEE)
And how are we feeling

CALLIE
Oh spectacular

HELENA
Would you like me to fix you some
breakfast Or lunch as it were

CALLIE
You have any whiskey for this

HELENA

You know I’m just delighted to
learn there isn’t embarrassment
enough in the world to dim that
winning sense of humor of yours

(and then pointed)
Petros Ill be outside with my
roses if you need me

CALLIE
Mom--—

Helena avoids eye contact with Callie as she leaves The back
door SHUTS A long beat then

PETROS
Your mama she love her roses

CALLIE
Yeah She loves anything she can
show off to her friends

PETROS
Eh flowers is nice But she talk
about you most the time She say
“Callie best house seller in San
Francisco” “Callie so beautiful
she sparkle like ruby” “She such
a funny girl”

(off Callie’s look)

Okay I say last one She not think
you very funny

They LAUGH Callie looks out the window at her mom Wishing
she didn’t have to be told such things by an old Greek man
INT CALLIE and PATRICK’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Callie tentatively walks through the front door

A SERIES OF JUMP CUTS Callie ducks her head into the
kitchen The backyard Bedroom No sign of Patrick
INT CALLIE and PATRICK’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Callie plops down on the bed exhausted Something catches
her eye ON THE NIGHT STAND--

It’s her NOTEBOOK She opens it up and turns to the page with
Patrick’s checklist “Cultured” “Sensitive” “Sense of
Humor” “Great in Bed” all checked off one-by-one Suddenly--

Callie fires the notebook across the room where it slams
into the far wall Then she curls up in a ball on her bad
and starts to CRY

EXT CALLIE and PATRICK’S HOUSE - GLENN PARK - DAY

Callie comes down the front steps doing three things at once
She pulls her jacket on balances her purse on her opposite
shoulder all while talking ON THE PHONE--

CALLIE
--No I can’t say I have much
mistress experience Mr Zimmet
Well the ocean can’t be soothing
for everyone sir Yes Ill be
right there I just have to hail a--

Callie starts to raise her hand when her face drops A
Cullen Crew Cab rolls up And Patrick’s behind the wheel

PATRICK
Thought you might need a ride to
the ninth circle of hell

CALLIE
Pretty sure I’m already there
Don’t you have a football tailgate
to be at

PATRICK
I was hoping maybe we could go
somewhere and talk

EXT PIER 39 - DAY

An eager throng of tourists peer down at the water where an
eager throng of SEA LIONS BARK for fish Patrick and Callie
walk the pier past the bait shop where--

CALLIE
The infamous site of our first
fake meeting Cute

PATRICK
An internet chat room seemed a
little impersonal

CALLIE
Is that why you brought me here To
remind me that we were living a lie
from the start

PATRICK

No Look Cal what I did It was
awful And I’1l understand if you
never forgive me But this This
wasn’t a lie It can’t be Because
if it was that means the last year
wasn’t the best of my life It’d
mean that you’re not my best
friend And it was And you are

(and then)
Youre my soulmate Callie I truly
believe that It’s- It’s just- I

CALLIE
You love dudes

She finally cracks a smile and Patrick can’t help but LAUGH--

PATRICK
I love dudes

The two of them stare out at the Bay for a long beat Then

CALLIE
I’m sorry about my little shit show
the other night

PATRICK
Yeah well I’d had 30 years to
figure things out and come out of
the closet and still hadn’t
Plus I could maybe understand why
youd be a little mad at me I did
almost run you over with my car
that one time

CALLIE
So did you talk to them

PATRICK
A little I’m sure we’1ll talk about
it more Preferably when my dad’s a
little more sober Oh he knew
by the way

CALLIE
What

PATRICK
Yeah apparently my mom was
convinced by the time I started 7th
grade That damn woman knew before
I did

(MORE)
PATRICK (CONTD)
Actually she was so sure and so
worried that I’d never admit it
that when she got sick--

CALLIE
Oh my god

PATRICK

All these years I’ve been dating
girls and it’s always been there
as my out No one would suspect a
thing “He’s just some guy with a
crazy mom who has a bunch of crazy
rules” Shit my mom was no fool
She knew my brothers wouldn’t be on
the fast track to anything

CALLIE

She was buying you time Wow
that is incredibly sweet in like
the most twisted way possible

PATRICK
That’s my mom
(and then)

But then you came along and

CALLIE
Ruined everything

PATRICK
Pretty much

They smile The sting softening a bit
PATRICK (CONTD)
It’s not the only reason it

wouldn’t have worked you know

CALLIE
I don’t think you need more than--

PATRICK
I’ve seen the way you act around
each other Everyone has
CALLIE

What What are you talking about
(off his look)
I don’t act any different around--

PATRICK
People who fight as much as you

guys do are either related
(MORE)

PATRICK (CONTD)
Or they wanna bone
(doing his best Liam)
That’s just a scientific fact man

Callie avoids eye contact for a long beat Finally

CALLIE
Okay I might have some feelings
for him Maybe

PATRICK
So do something about it

CALLIE
You know Patty I just got out of
this long-term thing and it didn’t
end too well--

PATRICK
He’s asking that girl to move in
with him after the game tonight
Cal After that

CALLIE
Look he’s happy And I’m guessing
he doesn’t want to talk to me again
after last night I doubt Seamus
and Liam do either

PATRICK
Im talking to you

CALLIE

It’s too late Believe me There’s

nothing I could
She trails off as her eyes fixate on something in the
distance Patrick turns to see it too There along the
Embarcadero is a familiar billboard with--
JOE MONTANAS SMILING FACE And the ad’s words ring truer
than ever “It’s never too lateto get back in the game”

EXT STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO - DAY

Patrick’s cab FLIES down the street weaving through traffic

INT PATRICKS CAB - DRIVING - CONTINUOUS

But Patrick isn’t driving he’s holding on for dear life--

PATRICK
Maybe you should let me talk to her
so you can concentrate on the road--

In the driver’s seat Callie phone in one hand waves him
off with the other leaving no hands on the steering wheel

CALLIE
(on the phone)
-could you just ask Layla the
name of the church please
Thanks mama

PATRICK
So what exactly is it that you’re
going to say to him

CALLIE
I havent really figured that part
out yet

PATRICK
You don’t have a plan

CALLIE
(shrugging)
I’m just gonna wing it
EXT STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO - CONTINUOUS

She LAYS ON THE HORN and SWERVES around a car gunning it
through the intersection barely beating a YELLOW LIGHT

And as The Jackson 5’s “I Want You Back” hits full volume on
the radio the cab goes flying up the 280-SOUTH on-ramp
INT PATRICK’S CAB - DAY

Callie and Patrick sit parked outside a church scanning the
parishioners as they head inside for Sunday mass

CALLIE

PATRICK
Callie I learned three things when
I was a kid never drink anything

JENNIFER a timeless beauty hurry toward church Late--

EXT ST PIUS CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

CALLIE
I don’t want an autograph--

JENNIFER

PATRICK
She’s not a groupie She’s with me

He pulls Callie toward him Jennifer looks him up and down
JENNIFER

Joe gives Callie a ‘sorry’ shrug and follows his wife inside
PATRICK
Richard Simmons Seriously

INT ST PIUS CHURCH - MOMENTS LATER

The Montanas sit in the back the mass already underway
Callie slips into the same pew and slides over to them--

JENNIFER
(whispering)
Listen sweetie I have mace in my
purse and I will use it

CALLIE
Please it’s important It’s about-
It’s about the guy I-- Well I
think I may love him and he’s
gonna end up with the wrong girl
unless--

Parishioners turn and glare Some SHUSHES

JENNIFER
You’re embarrassing us

CALLIE
(loudly)
Please This is my only shot

Her words ECHO through the church and everyone in the place
turns around All eyes on Callie

CALLIE (CONTD)
I’m gonna lose him And your
husband- You’re like a god to him
Joe Oh sorry no disrespect
Anyway he’s got this book signed
by the whole team except for you
and I think he’d talk to me if--

JENNIFER
So you do want an autograph That’s
what this is all about

CALLIE
No it’s just Look love is
Love is kinda like a two-minute
drill Things may look grim But
the game isn’t over until the clock
reads all zeroes And I’ve got 310
left to play here and I’m down by
three with 92 yards to go And
youre the only guy on the planet

She looks into his eyes and lets this sink in

CALLIE (CONT’D)
Look I know you and Ramy--

KEVIN

the party we got in this huge
fight Somehow she got it in her
head that I was in love with you or
something I don’t know what would
