FADE IN

EXT A BODY OF WATER - LATE AFTERNOON

A glimpse of sunlight desperately tries to force its way
through a gray sky before being obliterated
A MAN sunburned and bearded lets himself fall from the edge
of a boat and into the ocean

D

UNDERWATER through shafts of light white limbs are
FLAILING The MAN struggles alone Bubbles stream upward
He breaks the surface and gasps for air
He begins to swim His massive arms and shoulders grab at the
tide in large hard strokes His legs and feet are buried
beneath the dark ocean water
EXT HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

A floating tenement
A crane LOWERS a fishing net into the water The MAN swims
into it The net is RAISED as he lays motionless within its
grip
EXT BOAT DECK - CONTINUOUS 3

The crane swings around with the MAN in the net
He is EMPTIED out onto the deck like a fish

AHIVERING on the rotting wooden planks he FLIPS himself over
on his stomach Slowly using the palms of his hands he
DRAGS his trunk and withered limbs across the deck ina
labored lobster-walk

He uses his chest muscles to swing his legs around the edge
of the boat They dangle like pieces of rope his feet white
and flaccid
A towel a bottle and a glass are wordlessly placed next to
him by a CREW PERSON He pours himself a generous amount of
scotch and begins drinking

ISSOLVE TO
INT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
The same MAN is illuminated by the light of a single candle

He is dancing holding on tightly to a WOMAN

Though the light is dim it is clear that he is clean shaven
with his hair neatly trimmed

Their connection is powerful and alive They stop dancing
overwhelmed with mutual desire

He holds the WOMANs face in his hands and KISSES it all
over moving into a realm of feeling that is foreign to him

He kisses her passionately on the mouth

MAN
Oh my dear

His fingers run softly over the outside of her breasts She
begins to undo the back of her dress and slips it down around
her ankles Wearing only her tight corset she brings his
hands to the laces and together they undo it

WOMAN
(whispering softly)
Its all right darling Its all
right

INT HALLWAY - MORNING

OSCAR a manservant is carrying both a silver tray anda
pair of pants over his extended arm

A VOICE (0S)
Oscar Where the devil are you

Deftly Oscar opens the door to a spacious bedroom

OSCAR
My apologies Mr Roosevelt
INT BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

There with his bare legs muscular and lean sporting black
socks held up with garters is FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT 39

He projects a natural elegance and the confidence of a man
who can have anything he wants

Right now he wants his pants

FRANKLIN
Ive been standing here for five minutes

Oscar offers the tray to Franklin which bear cuff links anda
Tiffany watch which Franklin grabs

OSCAR
Did you sleep well sir

FRANKLIN
Dont remember Thats good isnt it

OSCAR
Yes sir

Franklin takes his pants from Oscar and steps into them
pulling the suspenders up and over his shoulders

INT DINING ROOM - MORNING

Striding into the dining room Franklin lifts a silver lid
off a breakfast plate He dismisses it and instead pours
himself a cup of coffee from a silver pot on the sideboard

He overhears a voice from the nearby sitting room

WOMAN (0S)
I could not be more delighted to have
received your most charming letter
It has been far too long since we last
corresponded However it is with
great reluctance I must decline your
kind speaking invitation

INT SITTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

ELEANOR ROOSEVELT 34 is dictating a letter Her enormous
eyes liquid and blue reveal a woman of extraordinary
intelligence and depth

ELEANOR
Unfortunately I would be of little
assistance to the Junior Assistance
League Particularly if my purpose
were to appear as an alumna who is
gifted at public speaking

She is dictating to LUCY MERCER 27 deeply feminine with a
head of soft dark hair and an accommodating nature She is
Eleanors social secretary and closest friend

She is also the WOMAN dancing with Franklin the night before

LUCY
And what do you really want me to say

ELEANOR
Thank you and if you ask again I
shall scream

They share a laugh -- which is not shared by the homely
rumpled mess of a man draped over a sofa in the corner

LOUIS
Why dont you ask your husband for
some pointers Hes a pretty gifted
public speaker dont you think

LOUIS HOWE 48 is a wizened man of limited stature and
unlimited soul Franklins political advisor extraordinaire --
part consiglieri and part priest He is the mastermind behind
what he believes will be the greatest political career of the
twentieth century

He gets up and leans in closely to Eleanor A cigarette dangles
off his lip and the smoke rises up and curls in her face

LOUIS
You should get out once in a while
Accepting that invitation would be
good for Franklins career

ELEANOR
Mr Howe wouldnt you be more
comfortable waiting for my husband
outside
LOUIS
In the street Mrs Roosevelt

ELEANOR
If you like

Eleanor smiles oh-so politely at Louis as Franklin enters
from the dining room

FRANKLIN
I see its not even eight am
and already the gloves are off
(kissing Eleanor on the
cheek)
Good morning Babs Hello Miss

Mercer L
uUCY
Good morning sir

Quickly she lowers her eyes to her work

LOUIS
(annoyed)
Youre late Honestly why do you
enjoy keeping people waiting

FRANKLIN
Because they always seem more
grateful to see me when I arrive

He leans in and kisses Eleanor on the cheek

FRANKLIN
Have a lovely day Babs

ELEANOR
Should I expect you for dinner

FRANKLIN
I have the Navy reception this
evening Ill be home quite late
Unless youve changed your mind
about coming

Louis looks up from his paper at Lucy who is writing
furiously

ELEANOR
Do you wish me to come
FRANKLIN
Well whatever youd like

ELEANOR
(a beat)
Thank you no

FRANKLIN
Very well then
(tipping his hat)
Good day Miss Mercer

Lucy nods and Franklin exits Then Louis tips his hat to the
ladies and follows him out

EXT WASHINGTON DC SIDEWALK - DAY

A car pulls over and Franklin is first out followed by
Louis walking at a brisk pace as they cross the opposite
side of the street Louis struggles to keep up while
consulting a small appointment book

LOUIS
At ten youve got a meeting with
representatives from Pittsburgh
Steel Their bid on the ship
building contract has already been
turned in and is on your desk for
approval

FRANKLIN
What did I think of it

An AFRICAN-AMERICAN man steps off the curb letting Franklin
and Louis pass

LOUIS
You had some problems with it

FRANKLIN
I better read it Steel workers
tend to vote democratic Next

LOUIS
Lunch with Secretary Daniels

FRANKLIN
Must I

LOUIS
Hes your boss

FRANKLIN
Anything else

LOUIS
(a beat)
What if shed said yes

FRANKLIN
Who

Louis shoots him a look that says you know who

LOUIS
People know Its time to stop

FRANKLIN
I can handle my own affairs Louis

LOUIS
Not this one This is Washington
DC not the Harvard Club
(off-put by Franklins
arrogance)
How can you be so cavalier

FRANKLIN
You say that like its a bad thing

Louis takes a quick last drag on his cigarette and follows
him inside a building

INT FRONT HALL - NIGHT

A large grandfather clock reads 300

The sound of a key in the front door turns and Franklin
quietly enters His hair is a mess and his clothing is
slightly askew

As he comes through the hall two eyes shine in the darkness
They belong to Eleanor sitting rigidly on a settee listening
to the sound of Franklins footsteps going up the stairs

INT UPPER LANDING - CONTINUING

Franklin goes into his bedroom Eleanor quietly comes up the
stairs and stops for a brief moment by Franklins door then

goes off to her bedroom closing the door behind her

INT FRANKLINS BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

Franklin lays sleeping in his bed as Eleanor enters quietly
so as not to wake him

Carefully she picks up a set of keys on the dresser then
turns and notices a packet of letters sitting on top of an
open duffle bag

Tentatively she reaches for them She brings the packet tied
with a piece of ribbon up to her nose She is shocked by

their familiar scent

With trembling hands she unties the ribbon Tears flood down
her cheeks as she reads

Franklin opens his eyes
CUT TO

EXT HYDE PARK - DAY

Springwood is the three-story Roosevelt mansion It is
surrounded by a thousand acres of forests fields bridal
paths and a glorious view of the Hudson River
THE FIVE ROOSEVELT CHILDREN are screaming on the front lawn
playing a boisterous game of croquet
INT SPRINGWOOD - DINING ROOM - DAY

SARA ROOSEVELT 65 sits at the head of the table She is one
for whom the expression Grande Dame was coined

Franklin is at the opposite end of the table looking pale
Louis as always is by his side

Eleanor like a prisoner who has accepted her fate sits
across from them calm and composed

ELEANOR
I have offered Franklin his freedom

FRANKLIN
And I have accepted

SARA
(to Eleanor)

His freedom is not yours to offer

FRANKLIN
I am in love with Miss Mercer Mama

LOUIS
Lord save us from fools in love

SARA
Falling in love is out of the
question Why do you think men have
mistresses Duty Duty to their
families and their careers

Eleanor rises from the table

SARA
Where do you think youre going

ELEANOR
Its obvious that my input in this
matter is of little importance

She begins to exit the room but Franklin is up like a shot

FRANKLIN
Babs

SARA
Come back here Both of you

INT ENTRY HALL - CONTINUOUS

Franklin chases Eleanor Midway up the stairs she turns
E
LEANOR
I dont know whether to hate you
or thank you

FRANKLIN
For what

ELEANOR
For forcing me to face my life
honestly for the first time

FRANKLIN
I didnt mean to hurt you Babs

ELEANOR

You never do You live your life

skimming the surface never aware

of the attachments beneath
(finding her anger)

It must be a luxury

She goes up the stairs without looking back

INT DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Franklin slowly walks back into the room

SARA
Divorce will finish your career in
politics How do you intend to
support yourself

FRANKLIN
My trust fund

SARA
Divorce Eleanor and there is no
trust fund

Franklin turns away He looks out the large picture window
and attempts to light a cigarette but his hands shake

LOUIS
Weve come so far boss State
Assembly Assistant Secretary of
the Navy -- all pages right out of
Cousin Teddys play book Were on
the road to the White House Dont
do this

Franklin sees his son ELLIOT 10 playing separately from
the rest of his siblings Elliot looks up at his father as
Franklin bares his best politicians smile at him

A ROAR begins to fill his ears It becomes clearer that it i
the sound of a CROWD CHEERING

CROWD NOISE (0S)
Rose-velt Rose-velt Rose-velt

INT DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION HALL - SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT

CONVENTIONEERS shout out Franklins name holding up PLACARDS

emblazoned with

COXROOSEVELT IN 20

Franklin BOLTS running vigorously down the center aisle of
the hall lit by the circle of a spotlight The CROWD goes

wild over this unconventional entrance
WwW

hen he reaches the edge of the stage he LEAPS onto it This
final act of daring pushes the crowd into frenzy

CLOSE UP - FRANKLIN

Smiling for no one For everyone

FRANKLIN
(breathless)
I humbly accept your nomination for
Vice-President

The CROWD roars back in reaction to his less-than-humble stance

FRANKLIN

They say the best way to get rido
aman is to have him run for Vice-
President

(he holds for the laugh)
You might well have asked my cousi
Teddy if thats how they got rid
of him

Franklin stands on the stage the music rising

something far more delicate

INT TEA ROOM - WASHINGTON DC - AFTERNOON

the crowd
cheering Slowly the sound of the convention fades to

DISSOLVE TO

A harp playing in an elegant tea room The hushed tones of

polite conversation wafts through the air

Franklin sits with his cousin ALICE ROOSEVELT

36

daughter

of Teddy Brilliant and acerbic she would have had a career

in politics had she been born a man

ALICE
Of course you lost A Roosevelt on
the democratic ticket Our ancestors

They both

are turning in their graves

FRANKLIN
Cousin Alice if Teddy were alive
hed be a democrat -- and you know it
ALICE

Rubbish But I do know one thing
Youre exactly like him My father
was born wanting only one thing to
be President

FRANKLIN
And whats wrong with that

share a laugh
ALICE

Do you know what theyre saying
about you

Franklins smile fades

FRANKLIN
No but Im sure youll tell me

ALICE
They say FDR stands for
featherduster That youre a

lightweight A dilettante with no
substance no point of view

FRANKLIN
Is that what you think

ALICE
You lead with your vanity You
talk when you should listen
Unless these are the qualities of
a democrat

F

RANKLIN

The democratic party is the party
of the people I am aman of the
people

ALICE
Darling youre a Roosevelt What
do you know about people

She leans in conspiratorially

ALICE
Of course I can think of one person
you did manage to find the time to
invest in A Miss Mercer I believe

FRANKLIN
Alice stop

ALICE
Dont misunderstand me Franklin
Being married to Eleanor I think
you deserved some fun But you made
the right decision Especially
since Miss Mercer has gone on with
her life

FRANKLIN
What are you talking about

ALICE
Edward Rutherford is a wonderful
catch for a girl like her

FRANKLIN
(stunned)
Shes married

ALICE
Last week A small event of course

FRANKLIN
When I last heard she was governess
to his children

ALICE
(with a smile)
And then love bloomed As a man of
the people I wouldnt be too hard
on her Franklin We cant all have
trust funds you know

EXT STATEN ISLAND BOY SCOUT CAMP - DAY

Louis and a PHOTOGRAPHER disembark from a touring car

LOUIS

FRANKLIN

Louis shoots him a look

LOUIS
Very funny No this buys you time
It buys you experience

FRANKLIN
What about Al Smith

LOUIS
Hes vulnerable Youre still a
fresh face boss Well use that to
our advantage

They walk down a hill towards some waiting Boy Scouts as the
PHOTOGRAPHER follows them

FRANKLIN
Boy Scouts Louis Hardly my
political base

LOUIS
Theyve got parents Besides
theyre photogenic

Franklin begins glad-handing the assembled group of mostly
underprivileged children

FRANKLIN
Franklin Roosevelt happy to
meet you

Franklin masks his thinly veiled discomfort with an
artificial good cheer Meanwhile Louis in full political
mode makes sure the L

Photographer gets everything

OUIS
Over here

Franklin poses with two Scouts The picture is taken

SCOUTMASTER
Okay boys lunch Line up to wash
(to Franklin)
Will you be joining us

FRANKLIN
Of course

Franklin steps into a line before a large communal water
barrel and glances sideways at GUISEPPE 9 an immigrant
child of the city streets He wears his uniform proudly and
smiles at Franklin

FRANKLIN
Whats your name son

GUISEPPE
Guiseppe

Franklin puts his arm around Guiseppe forcing the moment
between them He waits patiently as the cameras click away

FRANKLIN
Guiseppe Come sta ragazzo

GUISEPPE
(puzzled)
Okay I guess

The SCOUTS begin washing their hands together in the water
barrel and Franklin joins in as Louis looks on admiringly

As Guiseppe splashes some of the water on his face Franklin
not to be outdone does so as well Its all for the cameras

ESTABLISHING SHOT - CAMPOBELLO ISLAND

EXT ROOSEVELT SUMMER HOME - DAY

A large but unpretentious house with a sweeping lawn that
looks out over the icy waters of the Bay of Fundy

EXT PORCH - LATE AFTERNOON

Eleanor sits quietly on the front porch knitting -- ina
world of her own

A few feet away -- also in a world of his own -- sits Louis
overdressed for summer in a three piece suit An overflowing
ashtray is by his side and piles of newspaper lie at his
feet

He holds up a paper to Eleanor with the photo of Franklin and
the Boy Scouts

LOUIS
Hes a natural

Eleanor gives it a cursory glance then looks out to where
Franklin and the children come bounding up the lawn

Franklin and Elliot break out from the rest and begin racing
up the lawn Franklin no match for his sons speed loses
He doubles over trying to catch his breath

ELLIOT
Vae victis (Woe to the
conquered)
Cc
aught up in his victory Elliot doesnt see Franklin sneak
up behind him and tackle him to the ground

FRANKLIN
Festina lente (Not so fast)

One by one the other children all pile on top of Franklin and
Elliot

ELEANOR
Dinner is in one half-hour Come in
and change children

FRANKLIN
Up Up chicks You heard your
mother

Everyone runs up the porch stairs and into the house except
Franklin

ELEANOR
Go wash up

Utterly spent Franklin lays on the grass not moving

LOUIS
Hey boss Are you all right

Slowly Franklin gets up and walks with great effort up the
porch stairs

FRANKLIN
Im fine
(re her knitting)
Oh thats pretty Babs

He puts his hand on Eleanors shoulder and leans in to buss
her cheek but Eleanor quickly stands

ELEANOR
I must check on dinner

There is a cursory formality to her words and little warmth

FRANKLIN
Very well

She goes into the house Louis then hands Franklin letters

LOUIS
Tired

FRANKLIN
Of you Never

Wearily he sorts through the envelopes

LOUIS
Why dont you nap before dinner

FRANKLIN
Yes dear

Franklin heads into the house leaning heavily against the
screen door struggling for control

DISSOLVE TO

INT SUN ROOM - DAY

Franklin lays on a chaise being examined by a DOCTOR who
leans over him holding out his hand

DOCTOR
Can you take my hand

paralyzed He can only breathe and blink

The Doctor glances at Eleanor Louis and Sara indicating they

should follow him out

EXT SCREENED PORCH - DAY

As the door from the sun room opens onto the porch Elliot
there waiting Seeing them coming he dashes off into the

yard so as not to be seen as Eleanor Louis Sara and the

Doctor enter

DOCTOR
He has Infantile Paralysis Polio

Sara sinks into a chair

SARA
I knew it I knew it

D

ELEANOR
thought it only struck children

OCTOR
Not necessarily

LOUIS
How did he get it

DOCTOR
Some experts believe it is linked
to contaminated water But that
theory is speculative at best

LOUIS
It was the visit to that god damned
Boy Scout Camp

DOCTOR
In all honesty you need to be
looking forward not back

is
ELEANOR
What is the prognosis

DR LOVETT
The damage to his leg muscles is
extensive I suspect he will be
paralyzed from the waist down

ELEANOR
Dear God

And the children

DR LOVETT
If they dont have any symptoms by
now then they have been spared

Sara stands -- her bearing once again erect and proud

SARA
Then we must count our blessings

R LOVETT
You will need to prepare yourselves
There is a deep depression that
follows an illness of this magnitude
Im afraid life as he knew it is over

Their discussion is suddenly interrupted by the sound of a
child crying Eleanor rushes off the porch to the bushes

ball weeping She leans down and wraps her arms around him

INT BEDROOM - WEEKS LATER

CLOSE-UP - WALLPAPER

A pink background covered in small white flowers with red
centers and green leaves There is a seam in the paper A
tiny white spot where glue has soaked through

PULL BACK TO REVEAL - Franklin in bed

This is all he stares at -- hour after hour after hour

His lips are dry

A glass of water sits tantalizingly on the night stand

reaches for it but its a few inches out of his reach
Slowly he begins to rock his torso back and forth
INT HYDE PARK - PARLOR - CONTINUOUS

Sara Eleanor and Louis are in heated conversation

SARA

INT BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Franklin still rocking his torso has now gained some
momentum managing to have moved just a few inches

INT SUN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Sara busies herself arranging flowers

SARA
What kind of life is it to be
pitied and stared at

ELEANOR
What kind of life is it to be
hidden away I know you believe
that what you are suggesting for
Franklin is best But I think you
are making it harder for him

SARA
I think I know whats best for
Franklin I am his mother

ELEANOR
And I am his wife

Sara stares at Eleanor in disbelief Eleanor stares back --
unflinching

INT BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Franklin reaches his arm towards the glass only to fall from
the bed to the floor with a thud Frustrated beyond words
Franklin lunges at his wheelchair and shoves it across the
floor letting out an anguished cry

In agony from both the pain and the humiliation he stares
up and fixes his gaze on the ornate ceiling overhead

Then closing his eyes a POUNDING in his head starts to get
louder and louder --

Cut TO

INT BOAT - DAY - BACK TO PRESENT

Franklin on his back his face and body drenched with sweat

is asleep in his bunk in the boat He awakens to the sound of
the POUNDING Voices are calling him accompanied by FISTS
smashing at the door He opens his eyes and is disoriented
He tries to sit up -- momentarily forgetting that he cant

e lifts the sheet and visibly WINCES in disgust at the sight
of his crippled legs BONES covered by FLESH with barely an
ounce of muscle

Finally the door BURSTS open Two young crewman EUGENE and
STANLEY enter

EUGENE
Mr Roosevelt we got a storm
comin

He lifts Franklin over his shoulder Stanley grabs clothes and
pulls a set of long iron leg braces from a hook off the wall

Eugene grabs a bucket and holds Franklin up to urinate

FRANKLIN
(while peeing)
Leave me here Let the ocean
swallow me up Burial at sea
Perfect for a navy man

Stripped to his underwear Franklin is laid across the bunk
Eugene kneels and puts on Franklins socks and shoes Then he
and Stanley slide on his braces and pants

Their hands zipper clasp buckle and tie Each hand works in
synchronicity with the other

Clumsily they lift Franklin up struggling under his weight

EXT BOAT - DAY

Eugene and Stanley carry Franklin off in the driving rain

INT DINER OFF THE FLORIDA COAST - DAY

Kerosene lamps light the diner which is filled with people
mostly fishermen seeking refuge from the coming storm
Franklin soaked-to-the-skin and wrapped in a blanket is
being pushed through the door by Eugene in a wheelchair

The restaurant collectively pauses to take them

Franklin is slowly wheeled across the restaurant He shrinks
from the stares of the patrons

A LITTLE GIRL eating with her parents gets excited when she
sees Franklins braces and points Franklin gives her a hard
look and she is hurt

What he cant see is that under the table she wears a set of
braces like his

Franklin is wheeled up to his table and EUGENE and STANLEY sit
down with him

Louis enters resembling a drowned rat He rips off his hat
and raincoat and puts down his suitcase

FRANKLIN
(genuinely surprised)
Louis

LOUIS
I never miss Florida in the rainy
season

FRANKLIN
No letter No wire

LOUIS
Why Would you have answered it

FRANKLIN
What the hell are you doing here

LOUIS
Good to see you too Nice whiskers
You look like Chester Arthur

FRANKLIN
Stanley this is Mr Howe He gets
sea-sick at the mere sight of a
boat so hes probably happy that
its being Ldestroyed right now

OUIS
Boys I need to talk to Mr Roosevelt
alone Find your own breakfast Heres
a five spot Make it a feast

They look at the money and take their leave

FRANKLIN
Youre always so generous with my
money

LOUIS
You mean your mothers dont you

The Waitress puts down two cups of coffee Franklin pulls out
a flask and pours some into his cup He then lights a
cigarette and begins smoking but doesnt offer one to Louis
Without asking Louis helps himself

FRANKLIN
So Mama financed this fools
errand has she Well its a waste
of a trip

LOUIS
It was Eleanors idea

Franklins face is immobile

WAITRESS
What can I get you

LOUIS

(to Franklin)

FRANKLIN
Nothing I fancy nothing

LOUIS
Hell have the same

The Waitress grabs their menus and scurries away Louis opens
his briefcase and hands Franklin a stack of mail Franklin
glances it but doesnt open any

LOUIS
There are a few from your children

FRANKLIN
I can still read

Franklin flips through the mail and finds a letter that
interests him opening it

LOUIS
Your wife wants you to come home
(choosing his words)
Shes concerned Im concerned

FRANKLIN

From George Foster Peabody He owns
a resort in rural Georgia for
investment purposes Hot springs or
something He claims that only
recently a crippled boy swam in the
waters and can walk again

LOUIS
Oh for Chrissake

FRANKLIN

(reading)

The high magnesium content of
these natural springs will hold

anyone up Although it is not a
resort for infirm types I am
extending you my personal
invitation to come visit in the off-

(putting the letter aside)
Im only welcome in the off-

Eugene and Stanley approach the table

FRANKLIN

(to Louis)
Wheres the letter from Peabody
LOUIS

He hands Franklin the letter who rereads it

FRANKLIN

INT A TRAIN CAR - DAY

Franklin and Eleanor sit next to one another Franklin is now
shaved and cleaned up considerably

However the tension between them is palpable Eleanor knits
furiously while talking Franklin looks out the window at
African-American FIELD HANDS hard at work in the red clay
hills of Georgia

ELEANOR
James has been doing so much better
now that Elliot has joined him at
Groton Theyve put their
differences behind them and have
become a real team

alongside the slow-moving train

takes off his hat and wipes his brow in the hot sun

LEANOR
Meanwhile any suggestion I make to

Franklin She listens to you

She looks over at Franklin and sees that he is staring out the
window deep in thought -- not having heard a word shes said

EXT BULLOCHVILLE TRAIN STATION - GEORGIA - DAY

TOM LOYLESS 39 stands waiting by a car dressed in a white
suit Laconic with a dry sense of humor Tom is a man of few
words whose poker face hides a true desperation He holds a
telegram from Franklin in his hand

As the train pulls in Tom looks for Franklin among the
passengers making their exit

There are two different exits on the platform clearly marked
WHITE and COLORED Whites exit from the front of the train

and Blacks from the rear

Victorian Hotel and the words Our renowned mineral hot
springs can cure whatever ails you

yellow monstrosity leaning slightly to one side Paint is
peeling everywhere What once were flower beds are overgrown
with weeds

The car pulls to a stop

TOM

privacy There are only a few
guests right now as its the off-

said

At a lectern behind which a banner reads LEAGUE OF WOMEN
VOTERS the CHAIRWOMAN sees them and waves them forward

CHAIRWOMAN
Ah here she is now Ladies Mrs
Franklin Roosevelt

A small crowd of about two dozen women offer up polite but
scant applause for Eleanor

ELEANOR
Good afternoon I am so pleased to
be invited here today
looking down at her
cards)
Too often

A PHOTOGRAPHER snaps a picture which throws Eleanor off

ELEANOR
Too often

She stops The pause is deadly Louis looks ready to jump out
a window Eleanor continues her voice still pitched too high

ELEANOR
Too often the great decisions are
originated and given form in bodies
made up wholly of men

Slowly she begins to find her voice

ELEANOR
So that whatever political value
women have to offer is shunted
aside without expression
T
his is a mistake

She looks up from her cards and stares at the audience
and for the first time speaks spontaneously

ELEANOR
I think this might be the reason I
am having such a difficult time
giving voice to my own thoughts
here today

The immediacy of her self-effacing comment charms the room
ELEANOR

Im reminded of what someone once
said about looking at an elephant
That it is impossible to ever see

an entire elephant from one place --
you must walk around it If our
elected leaders are to be truly
effective then they must be willing
to go out of their way to look
beyond what is right in front of
them To see the entire elephant
And for that they need our help

The ladies applaud her much to her relief Louis beams

Chairwoman are drinking tea

I walked five steps today

TOM
Congratulations Listen Franklin
I got word a local reporter wants
to do a story on you

RANKLIN
Im hardly newsworthy these days
(a beat)
How did he find out Im here

TOM
Small town -- word gets out It
probably wont amount to more than
a provincial puff piece but it
might give us some free publicity
for the Inn

Franklin looks at Tom knowing full well hes arranged this

TOM
All right I know the gentleman
Im doing him a favor You know I
used to be a journalist

FRANKLIN
Do you mean all this time Ive been
talking to a newspaper man

TOM
Not anymore I got in a bit of
trouble in Atlanta Seems some of
the editorial pieces I wrote
offended the sensibilities of a
local civic group So I needed to
lay low for a while

You mean the Klan Good God Tom

Thankfully Mr George Foster
Peabody gave me this job

margin

FRANKLIN
Now its the waters extra minerals

difference At 90 degrees I can

Sara sits at a piano between FRANKLIN JR 9 and JOHN 7
They are finishing a rousing rendition of Angels We Have
Heard on High as an enormous Christmas tree gets decorated

JAMES 18 is at the top of a ladder while his sister ANNA
19 decorates from the lowest rung

Eleanor holds up a tiny porcelain ornament to Anna

Silence descends over the room No one dares to breathe

ELEANOR
Give it to James Hes the tallest

JOHN
No

John give it to him

JOHN
Papa always does it

FRANKLIN
I can do it

Franklin tosses the star in an attempt to reach the top It
almost catches but it falls to the floor

climbs back up and puts the star on top Sara sensing the
awkwardness of the moment begins to play and sing an overly
cheery rendition of Hark The Herald Angels Sing

INT STUDY - LATER

Roy is spotting Franklin as he pulls himself along a set of
parallel bars Eleanor observes as Franklin uses his arms to
drag his legs behind him

ELEANOR
It was an extraordinary turnout
this afternoon Louis says there
were over two hundred people in the
audience

FRANKLIN
Thats marvelous Babs

Eleanor is flushed with pride Franklin catching her look
slips slightly on the bars as Roy grabs hold of him

ROY
Ive got you sir

Franklin then takes note that Eleanors expression has turned
to one of pure heartbreak

FRANKLIN
You wonder why I want to go back to
Georgia its to avoid people who

look at me the way you just did

ELEANOR
You truly believe the waters
(with difficulty)
that they are helping

FRANKLIN
Dont talk to me as if I were a
child Choosing your words so
carefully

ELEANOR

water Im in some way causing the
muscles to regenerate themselves
and repair the damage

He swims to the edge of the pool

FRANKLIN
So everybody grab the edge of the
pool and move what you can

Roy trounces Franklin with three swift moves

ROY

conclusion myself

to help extend your hip flex your
nee and rotate your tibia

HELENA

strength Im not able to see yet

But to do that you would need to

Tom struggling with a suitcase comes down the ramp He
deposits it in the trunk and then walks precariously back up
the ramp having difficulty navigating the incline

He goes back into the house for one last bag When he comes
out hes surprised by what he sees --

FRANKLIN (0S)
Where do you think youre going

Franklin is being pushed by Roy in his wheelchair They are

both dressed in pajamas and bathrobes though Franklin has a
blanket around his shoulders to shield him from the morning

chill

Tom is caught This is everything he wanted to avoid

TOM
Going to Asheville to see my
parents

From the sight of Toms car stuffed with luggage it is clear
he is not coming back

want to die in the bed I was born
Franklin is struggling with this

TOM
Youre going to do great things
This place has an identity now --
a purpose It has you

Any guard Franklin had is gone He reaches out and takes Tom
by the sleeve slipping his hand into Toms gripping it tightly

TOM
Take care of yourself Roy

Tom takes one last look at Franklin

FRANKLIN
You never pitied me Thank you for that

consume too much of his time and
energy

doing then we will all discuss this

He begins showing off a system of pulleys and levers that
have been attached to both pedals They thread through holes
in a second dashboard attached to polished wood knobs

Its a hand-controlled automobile

PETE
That one there is your brake

FRANKLIN
Got it

PETE
And this heres the gas

FRED
Hot damn You got hand controls

PAT

PETE
Now you got to push it real smooth

Franklin excitedly turns the key and starts it up

PETE
Wait Mr Roosevelt youre not
ready to drive yet

FRANKLIN
Oh yes I am

Franklin hits the gas as the car begins HALTING and JERKING
the whole way down the driveway Pete is yelling out

A small schoolhouse will go there
We need it badly as many of the
children are barred from the local

FRANKLIN
We also require a blacksmiths shop

What exactly are you proposing
Franklin
FRANKLIN

That this will be the first polio
rehabilitation and treatment center
in the world My personal trust
almost covers the price of the Inn
and the surrounding land There
will be a modest tuition charged to
the patients which should hold us
over while I seek out investors

LOUIS
Franklin youre risking everything
you have

ELEANOR
And there are other costs to
consider

FRANKLIN

Mama will see that the children are
provided for

ELEANOR
Im not speaking of money

FRANKLIN
I have found something here which
makes waking up in the morning
remotely bearable and the two of
you stand there

practical and realistic

Practical I am trapped inside a
body that no longer moves of my own

Eleanor seated next to Franklin watches as Franklin ina
rare moment of emotional nakedness is at a loss for words

JAKE
All right then if I may do the
honors of presenting to you the
lovely Miss Eloise Hutchison of
Cottage C

Eloise wheels herself out In a sweet but untrained voice
she begins the introduction to her song

ELOISE

Think of what youre losing by
constantly refusing to dance with me
Y
Aoud be the idol of France with me

nd yet you stand there
And shake your foolish head dramatically
WwW

hile I sit here so ecstatically
You just look and say emphatically
Not this season
Theres a reason

Some members of the audience begin to smile knowing whats
coming Various STAFF step out from the kitchen to watch

Eloise is joined by three others -- all of them in wheelchairs
ELOISE and CHORUS
(singing)
I wont dance Dont ask me
I wont dance Dont ask me
I wont dance monsieur with you

Simple but clever choreography utilizing the wheelchairs
has the audience cheering

ELOISE and CHORUS

My heart wont let my feet do
c

things they should do

HORUS
You know what Youre lovely

ELOISE
And so what Im lovely

CHORUS
But oh What you do to me
Im like an ocean wave thats
bumped on the shore
I feel so absolutely stumped on the
floor

This is too much for the crowd including Franklin Eleanor
and Louis They laugh and cry in equal measure at the sight
of Eloise and her Chorus

The song finished Franklin quiets down the crowd

FRANKLIN
Before we say good night
I understand our Royal-Taskmaster-

takes in the sight of so many different faces

Some are beaming some are fighting back tears some look
away the sight of it almost too painful a reminder of

their own private battles

ON DAISY

distance and lands in her mothers outstretched arms

WILD CHEERS go up in the room while Daisys face glows with
pride She connects with Franklin who matches her smile with
his own -- genuine and beatific

fter a beat Franklin begins to unbuckle his pants He then
lies back on the bed

ELEANOR
What is your most pressing concern

Eleanor kneels before him and tugs the pants down slowly so
as not to catch on the braces

Eleanor folds the pants and carefully places them over the
back of a chair
FRANKLIN
Getting a doctor to live on the
premises full-time Someone who
at the very least could monitor
our progress Make us legitimate

She begins to take off Franklins braces -- a series of

intricate buckles

Eleanor slides the braces off his legs His legs

though now

deeply tanned are withered and spindly He is still wearing

his shoes

ELEANOR
And that costs more money

FRANKLIN
Yes

Eleanor puts the heavy braces against the wall and kneels

once again to untie his shoelaces

FRANKLIN

But the real problem is no one is
interested The annual Orthopedics
Convention is being held in Atlanta
this weekend and I offered to
speak

(his anger surfacing)
They turned me down flat

Eleanor takes Franklins pajama bottoms off the bed and with

tender care pulls them up his legs

A few weeks ago the conditions at
a garment factory on West 27th

attention The owners claimed
everything was satisfactory but
would never let anyone in to
conduct a proper inspection

At the risk of my good standing
with the Junior Assistance League
I suggest we crash the party

through his hair E

FRANKLIN
Read it Out loud Page twenty-nine

Read it

HELENA
Of the twenty three patients examined
only one a forty-four year old male
showed little visible signs of
improvement This is one doctors
opinion Franklin

FRANKLIN

Keep reading

HELENA

There is marked falling away of
the muscle masses on either side of
the spine in the lower lumbar
region His lower extremities
present a most depressing picture

She brings the pages down but Franklin gestures her to

continue

Something catches Franklins eye and his smile begins to fade

HELENA
I feel after studying him that the
psychological factor in his
management is paramount He has
such courage and ambition Yet at
the same time he is such an
extraordinarily sensitive emotional
mechanism

It is difficult for her to continue

FRANKLIN
Please

HELENA
that it will take all the skill
which we can muster to lead him
successfully to a recognition of
his severe physical limitations
without crushing him

FRANKLIN
Patronizing son-of-a-bitch I
wanted to walk again

HELENA
And you still might This report
legitimizes weve worked so hard
for We can raise funs now It
could change everything

FRANKLIN
It wont change anything for me

HELENA
Franklin I wont play this game I
wont feel sorry for you

e reaches for the bottle but Helena grabs on to it
stopping him

HELENA

I met a boy today ten years old
Hes paralyzed from the waist down
Why dont you go regale him with
vivid tales about your trips to
Europe and playing football at
school Tell him how you courted
your wife and fathered children

Tell him of a life he can only
dream of

Dark and deserted Roy is carrying Franklin down a flight of

possible Eleanor appears even more nervous than Louis

FRANKLIN
Youre being superstitious Louis
There arent any reporters here

Suddenly out of the darkness a FLASHBULB POPS revealing a
dozen or more REPORTERS staring incomprehensibly at the sight
of a six foot 200 lb man being carried like a baby in the
arms of a black man

No one does or says a thing The PHOTOGRAPHER who had the
wherewithal to snap the one picture raises his camera to take
another

But DAN REED a reporter for The New York Herald Tribune and
a gentle giant at over six foot-four reaches out and places
a massive hand over the lens
Slowly but firmly he pulls the camera down

REED

(
quietly)
No

Louis and Eleanor stand stock still tense watching the
scene unfold

Roy is sweating his arms growing weak Elliot brings the
chair around and Roy gently lowers Franklin into it

Its a measure of Reeds standing with this group that his
authority is unquestioned

But the Photographer raises his camera again Only now Reed
isnt as kind He grabs the camera from him and opens the
back pulling out the film and exposing it

PHOTOGRAPHER
Hey

REED
(tipping his hat)
Good to see you Mr Roosevelt

Taking no chances he pulls a hammer out from the rear of his

A BLINDING SPOTLIGHT picks up Franklin and Elliot The
SPOTLIGHT follows them as they make their way to the podium

Franklin is hitching each leg forward slowly The tip of his
cane hits the floor with pinpoint accuracy for balance and
support

He leans heavily on Elliots arm The walk appears effortless

He chats with Elliot the whole way still managing to flash
the CONVENTIONEERS his million dollar smile But the walk is
slow and the ovation is beginning to fade

Sensing the crowd noise weakening he whispers to Elliot

FRANKLIN
Laugh as if Im making a joke

Elliot throws back his head and laughs The crowd wanting to
be in on it rise as one in a sustained CHEER

But a puddle of sweat caused by the dripping perspiration
from Franklins hands is causing the tip of his cane to slip

Elliot ever aware grips him tighter averting disaster and
finally they reach the podium

Franklin grabs one side of the podium while Elliot witha
sleight of hand Houdini would admire LOCKS his fathers
braces whisks the cane away pulls his fathers speech from
his breast pocket and lays it smoothly on the podium

THE VIEW FROM BEHIND displays how Franklins legs are spread
wide for stability as he clutches the podium He holds on
tightly as if the wood might snap from his grip

FROM OUT FRONT the crowd sees only a powerful man standing
tall amidst the flashbulbs POPPING

Franklin has made it He is home

Four years later Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected
President of the United States He was elected three more

times -- unprecedented in US History

During his years as President he saw the country through the
Great Depression and a world war waged on six continents

On April 12 1945 in the thirteenth year of his presidency
at the age of sixty-three Franklin Roosevelt died in his
cottage at Warm Springs

The beneficiary of his 562000 life insurance policy was
Warm Springs which continues to flourish as a
rehabilitation center to this day
