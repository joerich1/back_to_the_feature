FADE UP
CLOSE UP on the face of YURI ORLOV

Late-thirties maybe the wrong side of forty cigarette dangling
from his fingers wearing a conservative suit and tie

Black smoke wafts in front of his face He speaks matter-of-

factly

of

and

the

top

directly into camera
YURI
There are over 550 million firearms in
worldwide circulation Thats one firearm
for every twelve people on the planet The
only question is
(taking a draft and stubbing out
the cigarette)
-how do we arm the other eleven
The camera zooms away from his face revealing
Yuri alone on a battlefield surrounded by the charred carcasses
armored military vehicles and other equipment discarded weapons
ammunition desert floor stained with what appears to be blood
The faint sound of gunfire some distance away carries to us on
wind
CUT TO
A TITLE SEQUENCE FOLLOWS - A CONTINUOUS SHOT FROM A CAMERA
MOUNTED ON THE BACK OF A BULLET CASING - ILLUSTRATING THE
LIFESPAN OF THE BULLET

- Gunpowder is poured into a metal casing lead slug mounted on

A BULLET is born A perfect 39mm
- The BULLET travels along a conveyor belt with thousands of
identical siblings in a Ukrainian factory so grey its

monochrome

- The BULLET picked up by a ham-fisted UKRAINIAN FACTORY WORKER

is

tossed into a crate

- The BULLET lying in its open crate rolls down a chute where
its

inspected by a UKRAINIAN MILITARY OFFICER holding a manifest He

seems to stare directly at our BULLET

UKRAINIAN OFFICER
(to his SUBORDINATE carrying a
manifest in Ukrainian)
Call it agricultural machinery

- The BULLETs crate rattles around in an open-bed truck along an

industrial road passes a decapitated statue of LENIN

- The crate containing our BULLET is placed on a ship in

the cold grey Odessa harbor A container door closes plunging
the

bullet into darkness

- The door re-opens The BULLET still in its crate now basks
in

bright tropical sunshine surrounded by an azure sea

- The crate is removed by a pair of slim dark hands revealing a

glimpse of the bustling weathered port of Abidjan in the Ivory

Coast The crate is one of dozens unloaded from the ship

- BULLETs POV from another open-air truck now slogging through
a

mud-clogged road in lush rainforest

- The BULLET is unloaded from the truck in Freetown Sierra Leone

immediately grabbed by the young HAND of a RUF soldier

- The BULLET is loaded into a 30-round magazine which is inserted

into an AK-47 machine gun

- The BULLET waits - in the gloomy chamber Suddenly from
outside

the sound of raised voices and gunfire

- The BULLET and its neighbors start to rise quickly up the

magazine
towards the chamber as the Kalashnikov is fired
- Our hero BULLET is next Will it see action

- Smack The guns bolt strieks the explosive cap gunpowder
ignited the BULLET driven out of the barrel

- Shed of its casing - now only a slug - the BULLET emerges into
bright sunshine It is flying down the main street in Freetown

- The BULLET gives us a perfect point-of-view of the bullet ahead

of

it They are both flying towards their intended target - a wild-

eyed CHILD SOLDIER a boy no more than twelve firing an AK-47

almost as tall as he is

- The leading bullet narrowly misses whistles past the boys
ear

striking the whitewashed wall behind - one more pock-mark ina

building riddled with pock-marks

- Our BULLET following close behind finds its mark slamming
into

the boys forehead just above his left eye - his expression
oddly

relieved

- The BULLET carves through the lobes of the boys brain

where it is enveloped in blood finally plunged into

darkness - the bullets final resting place

Odessa

USSR - 1980

Fifteen-year-old YURI walks into frame He spies a long line
snaking away from the door of a barren grocery store

YURI (VO)
I was born Yuri Orlovitch in the city of
Odessa in a country that no longer exists
You might have heard of it - a little place
called the Soviet Union
A YOUNG COMMUNIST sits in the shadow of a statue of Trotsky in

the
Soviet-style plaza jacket and neckerchief removed in the summer
heat
poring over a Communist text Yuri approaches pretends to be
interested in the statue glances to the Young Communists book
YURI
(in subtitled Ukrainian looking over
the idealists shoulder)
All property is theft
The Young Communist nods at this kindred spirit Yuri pats his
comrade on the back taking the opportunity to steal the boys
red
neckerchief and Lenin pin
INT GROCERY STORE DAY
Now wearing the pin in his own jacket along with the neckerchief
and
a stern expression YURI strides to the front of the line in the
store
YURI (VO)
Where I grew up everyone was equal Some
were just more equal than others
The female STORE CLERK is about to order Yuri to the back of the
line when Yuri flashes the pin
Intimidated the Clerk smiles and pulls a special tray from under
the counter In contrast to the meager offerings on the shelves
the tray contains bags of sugar coffee bananas even Pepsi
INT APARTMENT - ODESSA DAY
A Soviet-style apartment building Front door opens - YURI

RADIO ANNOUNCER

(impossibly upper-crust British

--Finally in response to human rights
protests and in an effort to encourage the
United States to sell grain to the Soviet
Union after two successive crop failures it
is reported that the politburo has consented
to permit a limited number of Jews to
emigrate from the Soviet Union to Israel

(beat)
And that concludes this edition of news from
the BBC World Service

A car horn He glances through the window to the communist-style

plaza below ANATOLY beckons impatiently to Yuri ITALY and

old Russian Military Officer UNCLE DMITRI

Yuri stares at himself in the mirror He replaces his stolen

YURI (VO)
We congregated in New Yorks Brighton Beach
because of its similarity to the Crimean
Sea Ive always thought its appropriate
we moved next door to the circus

INT CRIMEAN RESTAURANT - LITTLE ODESSA DAY

A typical Jewish establishment with all its paraphernalia -
menorah

on the mantle etc The family sits in a small dining room

attached to the restaurant ANATOLY reads the Torah as he waits

for dinner with YURI and VITALY

YURI (VO)
I had no idea my father would take his
assumed identity so much to heart I guess
he just stayed in character

YURI older as we now know him studies school work Long-
haired
VITALY watches Band Aid on TV

IRINA puts a plate of mussels in front of Anatoly

ANATOLY
(glaring at the plate
incredulous)
How many times--I cant eat shellfish Its
treyf
IRINA

Youre not Jewish

ANATOLY
I like it
(picking up his felt fedora)
I like the hat - to remind us theres
something above us I like that

Anatoly dons his hat

ANATOLY (contd)
Im going to temple

IRINA
Youre not going to temple You go to
temple more than the rabbi
Vitaly begins eating his fathers plate of mussels Yuri watches
his
father exit

YURI (VO)
I was suffering an identity crisis of my own

We focus on orientation booklets from a careers fair Yuri

between the eagle of the CIA and the dove of the UN

YURI (VO)
My gift for languages made me highly sought
after The CIA and UN were both heavily
recruiting Russian immigrants

Yuri settles on the dove
EXT UNITED NATIONS DAY

The idealistic YURI ill-fitting suit full of optimism
approaches
the United Nations Building

YURI (VO)
Naturally I went with the UN They were
paying more

He strides past Luxembourgs gift to the UN - a sculpture of a
gun
with its barrel tied in a knot Never gives it a look

He is greeted at the entrance by an attractive female UN
Official
VIVIAN CARLISLE She likes what she sees

INT ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER DAY

The blue helmeted YURI is seated in a white UN armored

YURI (VO)
West Africas Liberia or land of the

1800s as a homeland for freed American
negroes Its been enslaved by one dictator
or another ever since They even copied
their masters Southern architecture

A tatty pile of weapons - some from World War II - sits in front
a long negotiating table

YURI blue beret observes the CHIEF UN ENVOY at the table
opposite warlord ANDRE BAPTISTE leader of the National
Revolutionary Front of Liberia (NRFL)

Baptiste 40s is an imposing figure In full uniform despite
heat he wears a jacket one size too small as if he cannot admit

extra few pounds His THIRD WIFE stands next to him wiping the
sweat from his brow like an intermittent windscreen wiper

YURI (VO)
It was my first meeting with the American-
educated Andre Roosevelt Baptiste While
the warning signs were all there no one had
any idea what a monster he would eventually
become I certainly didnt think he would
become my friend

Baptiste has a UN document in front of him awaiting his
signature clearly enjoying his moment in the sun

UN ENVOY
(referring to the meager pile
of weapons)
--With all due respect Mr Baptiste you
dont seriously expect us to believe that
this represents your entire arsenal

Baptiste shrugs

UN ENVOY (contd)
This is making a nonsense of the embargo
ratified by all five permanent members of
the Security Council The escalation in the
build up of arms jeopardizes not only order
in the region but ultimately world order

Baptiste smiles

BAPTISTE
(playing to the gallery)
--World order You say we jeopardize world
order

Baptistes Third Wife wipes his brow

BAPTISTE (cantd)
Your idea of world order is when youre
giving the orders to the world

The Envoy has no response

Baptiste rises from the table leaving the unsigned document
sitting
there

BAPTISTE (cantd)
Excuse me

Baptiste is accompanied by two armed BODYGUARDS Yuris
commanding

officer CAPTAIN VIVIAN CARLISLE motions for one of her detail
to

follow - Yuri

BAPTISTE
(irritated by Yuris presence)
I am only going to the restroom

YURI
(shrug)
Orders

They reach the door marked MEN

BAPTISTE
(aside to his bodyguards as he enters)
This is what they mean by UN Observer

Yuri winces at the remark

INT PRESIDENTIAL MANSION RESTROOM DAY
BAPTISTE pisses at a urinal YURI and the BODYGUARDS hang back a
respectful distance

BAPTISTE
(taunting Yuri)
Arent you going to help me hold my cock

YURI
(glancing towards the urinal)
Doesnt look like a job for two men

The BODYGUARDS stiffen at the insult Baptiste stares Yuri down
for

a moment then suddenly bursts into laughter The TWO BODYGUARDS

also start to laugh - cautiously

Baptiste washes his hands stares at Yuri in the mirror smiles

BAPTISTE
You know you are fighting a losing battle
my young friend War is nature If you

take away the guns we will kill each other
with knives Take away the knives we will
kill each other with sticks Take away the
sticks we will kill each other with your
peace treaties

(turning to face Yuri)
You cannot stop this bath of blood

YURI
Its not bath of blood Its blood
bath

BAPTISTE

Thank you But I like it my way

Baptiste smiles and exits leaving the words ringing in Yuris
head

EXT UN COMPOUND - MONROVIA DAY

A pep rally for the mostly male UN PEACEKEEPERS A stage has
been

erected in the rundown Embassy grounds They chant and stamp
their feet

impatiently

A UN OFFICER acting as MC approaches the microphone
MC

(battling the microphones
feedback)
And now we have a surprise for you The
83rd West African Peacekeeping Corp is proud
to present all the way from El Salvador
the newly crowned Miss World Ava Cordova

From behind a jerry-rigged curtain appears the vision that is AVA

CORDOVA She wears a dress that appears to have been sewn onto
her

She is obscenely beautiful in the squalid setting

The peacekeepers roar and whistle their approval YURI near the
front

of the stage is hypnotized

Standing closer to Yuri than necessary despite the crush is
CAPTAIN

VIVIAN CARLISLE (attractive in her own right but pales in
comparison

with the Goddess on stage) She catches Yuris reaction

UN PEACEKEEPERS
(chanting to Ava)
Take it off baby Take it off

Ava steps up to the microphone

AVA
(veferring to the sea of UN
berets)
Baby blue My favorite color

A roar of approval from the men

AVA (cantd)
I suppose I could give you the speech about
my hope for world peace but I have a
feeling you dont want to hear that today

UN PEACEKEEPER
(calling out)
My hope is for a piece of your ass

They roar again

AVA
(laughing it off)
I dont know if youll be taking me to bed
tonight darling but you can take her

Ava unfurls a life-size poster of herself in a swimsuit
flirtatiously holding it up against her body She tosses other
posters to eager hands
AVA (cantd)
Youre all doing a great job - keep it up Enjoy the
show

On stage a generic-looking ROCK GROUP starts to play a cover
from

the 80s - Tears For Fears Shout Ava dances
enthusiastically

provocatively

Ava appears to make eye-contact with Yuri - blowing a kiss in his
direction He is paralyzed

LATER

BACKSTAGE YURI and other Peacekeepers observe AVA escorted

Lets get drunk

EXT DOWNTOWN MONROVIA - BAR NIGHT

YURI and two other UN PEACEKEEPERS get loaded on local beer
with

local PROSTITUTES - one of the peacekeepers pouring beer down a

prostitutes throat

From the shadows across the street a LIBERIAN MAN observes the
group

Yuris colleagues toss some Liberian dollars at a waiter and
stagger
drunkenly away from the bar leaning for support on the

PROSTITUTES

to

YURI remains at the verandah exchanges a smile with a YOUNG
PROSTITUTE at least two years from legal

Hes tempted He knocks back his drink He approaches the girl
presses a few bills into her hand She picks up her purse makes
leave with him but he motions her to stay

MONROVIAN GIRL
(referring to the money)
Whats this

YURI
(explaining the tip)
For the smile

Yuri exits alone The Liberian Man across the street follows
EXT DOWNTOWN MONROVIA - STREET NIGHT
YURI walks down a poorly-lit sidestreet He feels something in

back - stops abruptly His hand reflexively goes to his holster
Empty

He turns The young LIBERIAN MAN is holding him up with his own
gun

YURI

(mixing English and French)
Fuck no no no no--fuck no Money You
want money

(going through his pockets

he starts pulling out loose bills)
Fuck no Dont shoot Dont shoot me
Fuck US dollars

(referring to the face on a five

dollar bill)

The Liberian puts his finger to his lips to hush Yuri
The Liberian appears more interested in the gun than the hold-up
LIBERIAN MAN

(in flawless English)
Glock 45
The Liberian produces a crisp US twenty dollar bill of his
offers it to Yuri

Yuri stares at the money bewildered

LIBERIAN MAN
President Jackson

He shakes his head

YURI
No

LIBERIAN MAN
(misinterpreting him)
You are driving a hard bargain

He hands Yuri a second twenty

YURI
(flabbergasted)
No keep it Keep the money Keep the gun

LIBERIAN MAN
(offended)
What do you take me for - a thief

The Liberian stuffs the money in the pocket of the bewildered
Yuri

LIBERIAN MAN
Demand and supply
(referring to the gun)
There is more I am thinking where this comes
from

YURI
(incredulous)
You want more Glocks

LIBERIAN MAN
And the Heckler and Koch G-3 assault rifle

YURI

What makes you think Ill do that

LIBERIAN MAN

(quizzical)
I will come back and shoot you with the
Glock

(checking the magazine referring

to the bullets)
By the way do you have the hollow point
cartridges

Yuri stares at the man

YURI
(facetious nodding to the gun)
You got any color preference for that

LIBERIAN MAN
(missing the sarcasm regarding the gun)
Kelly green
(meeting Yuris eye)
I will find you

The Liberian walks away still admiring his new weapon Yuri
stares
after him

YURI (VO)
Hed come to the right place - peacekeepers
are armed to the teeth And nothing but
premium product The UN mostly buys from
Switzerland - where else

INT CAPTAIN CARLISLES PRIVATE QUARTERS NIGHT
CLOSE ON two blue helmets lying beside each other

YURI and CAPTAIN VIVIAN CARLISLE are under the mosquito netting
ofa

bed in her private quarters - trying to get each other out of
their

respective clothes as fast as possible - mouths and hands

everywhere

Even in the heat of the moment VIVIAN is unable to completely
let
go of her work

VIVIAN
(between heavy breaths)
What are we doing here Yuri
YURI
(kissing her nipple)
Whatever you want

VIVIAN
You know what I mean Here in this
country Are we doing any good

YURI
(finally telling her what she
wants to hear)
Would nothing be better

Satisfied with the answer she completely gives in to the throes
of

passion - pulls him to her

LATER

VIVIAN satiated dozes amongst the rumpled sheets backside
exposed

YURI uses the opportunity to take an impression of the key
attached

to her belt

EXT EMBASSY COMPOUND NIGHT

A white armored personnel carrier sits unattended
The LIBERIAN MAN and two COLLEAGUES approach the carriers door
It
opens with their newly-made key
The men start to unload the weapons inside the carrier spilling

box of ammunition in their haste

The camera drifts off the carrier to reveal YURI behind the
barracks counting a thick wad of US dollars

Spying a lone BULLET on the ground Yuri picks it up We sense
he has
made a decision from which there is no return

EXT INT THE CRIMEAN RESTAURANT - BRIGHTON BEACH DAY

The BULLET has been turned into a pendant replacing Yuris Star
of
David
YURI wearing a sharp new suit enters the family restaurant
One
table of CUSTOMERS - not exactly a thriving concern

YURI (VO)
The starting salary for a UN interpreter
back then was 32000 I made fifty K on
misplaced weapons on that one trip alone
I doubt the Secretary General noticed The
UN spends more on lunch

Yuri kisses father and Maitre d ANATOLY who is adding more
Jewish

decoration to the window He bear hugs mother IRINA nearly

causing her to drop the plates she is carrying

YURI (VO)
My tour as a peacekeeper was the perfect
preparation for war

Irina notices the change in her sons appearance

IRINA
(calling after him)
Who are you Youre not my son My son
doesnt own such a suit

Yuri flashes his killer smile in response

Out of their sight he slips a hundred dollar bill into the cash
register and breezes into the kitchen

INT THE CRIMEAN RESTAURANT - KITCHEN DAY

VITALY now chef in the family business prepares a Russian
borscht
in a kitchen unlikely to pass a health inspection

YURI tastes the food pretends to gag spits it out in the sink
Vitaly affectionately cuffs his older brother - the joke
obviously a familiar ritual

Yuri takes his brother to the kitchens rear door
EXT THE CRIMEAN RESTAURANT DAY

At the back of the restaurant YURI and VITALY sit on the steps
amongst the garbage cans

YURI
You know whos going to inherit the earth
in

Vitaly looks at him blankly

YURI (contd)
Arms dealers - because everybody else is too
busy killing each other

YURI plonks a glossy arms brochure in front of Vitaly
the contents

VITALY
(regarding his brother)
Its a hell of a fucking career move

YURI
Thats the point Ive seen how the worlds
coming apart

VITALY
And you want to help with that

YURI
You cant stop it
(warming to his theme)
Its a basic human need - we eat sleep
sleep with each other and what else Fight
The oldest human skeletons have spearheads
in their rib cages

Vitaly is still skeptical

VITALY
What do you know about guns

YURI
(joking darkly)
I know which end Id rather be on
(adopting a serious tone)
Every day there are people shooting at each
other I think to myself what guns are
they using Why not mine

VITALY
(hesitant)
I dont know

YURI
(pressing his argument)
Vitaly Ive tasted your borscht youre no
fucking chef I can eat here for free and I
still dont eat here Youre doing nothing
with your life

He takes

--I can get you the shoulder-fired SA-7
surface-to-air missiles The older Chinese
model Not so effective against modern
military aircraft but deadly if used against
a commercial airliner Im giving them away
at eight-fifty

Yuri notices that his vendors attention has wandered to a suave

older gentleman SIMEON ZAHAROFF surrounded by eager VENDORS of
all

nationalities The Asian man joins the enthusiastic throng

YURI (VO)
It was the eighties and the Cold War was far
from thawed Most of the deals were
government-to-government There were some go-
betweens - freelancers - but it was a mostly
private club with a lifetime club president

Yuri drags Vitaly away from the sales girls

YURI
Thats him The guy Eli told me about Simeon
Zaharoff Brokered deals in the IranIraq war
- both sides sold missiles to Argentina in the
Falklands Hets a fucking legend Ive got to
talk to him

Yuri pushes past Zaharoffs entourage

YURI

May I help you

YURI
A mutual friend Eli Kurtzman from Brighton
Beach Import-Export said to contact you I
have a business proposal Perhaps we can
discuss it - over a drink

Simeon looks him up and down
SIMEON
Youre in the wrong place my young friend

This is no place for amateurs

Simeon walks away without another word Vitaly shrugs Yuri
fumes

YURI
(under his breath in Ukrainian)
Yob tvayu mat (Subtitled - Motherfucker)

Yuri watches Simeon go surrounded by flunkies

YURI (VO)
Curious how you always revert to your native
tongue in moments of extreme anger

INT HOTEL ROOM - PARIS NIGHT

Camouflage minidress and beret are now discarded on the floor - a
contrast to the blue helmet seen earlier

A street lined with shelled buildings

Beirut
Lebanon - 1986

Through one of the shell holes we glimpse YURI and VITALY with a
LEBANESE CUSTOMER

YURI (VO)
The job wasnt so different trom the UN I
was just as neutral working for the ununited
nations An equal opportunity merchant of
death I supplied every army but the
Salvation Army

We track with them only getting occasional glimpses through the
holes as they make their way through the war-torn streets of
Lebanon

YURI (VO)
We got our start in Lebanon after the
suicide bombing

They enter a building carrying a crude rendering of a Coke sign -
Taste Life The model drinking the Coke is Ava Cordova

INT BEIRUT WAREHOUSE DAY

Inside the warehouse is a ten foot high unruly pile of junked
weapons

YURI (VO)
When the United States leaves a war zone
they generally dont take their munitions
It costs more to bring it back than buy new
stock

YURI and VITALY usher the CUSTOMER over to an industrial scale
loaded with assorted weapons

YURI
I sell by the kilo
The CUSTOMER checks the combined weight of the weapons

YURI (contd)

(shrug)
Theyre second-hand weapons but theyre
still okay

Both men pullout calculators and start haggling over the price

YURI (VO)
For all my language skills I soon
discovered that what talks best is money
As long as you can speak dollars dinars
drachmas rubles rupees pesos escudos
lira krones kwanzas trancs guilders
deutshmarks yen and pounds-fucking-
sterling you can communicate anywhere in
the world

Money is finally exchanged Yuri and Vitaly leave the Customer

No More illegal

Vitaly nods thoughtfully

VITALY
What Id give right now for a plate of red
cabbage and potatoes

The wall explodes with gunfire
Yuri and Vitaly drop to the ground money flying

The machine gun fire subsides a shower of dust fragments of
brick

and hundred dollar bills still floating to the ground

Vitaly first to recover draws his own handgun sneaks a look
through a shell hole

On the other side of the wall a firing squad of MILITIAMEN has
executed one group of MEN lying contorted slumped against the
wall Their bound hands and feet give the bodies a macabre
awkwardness

Yuri is scrabbling in the dust for the cash

The Militiamen prepare to execute another six men Men We
focus

on one HANDSOME YOUNG LEBANESE BOY barely in his teens

Vitaly gun poised goes to intervene A HAND stuffed with
cash

stops him Yuri

The brothers eyes meet

YURI
(whisper motioning for them
to leave)
Its not our fight

Vitalys eyes well with tears

After one look back to the teenage boy Vitaly reluctantly
complies

- running with Yuri heads down away from the scene

As they run the wall explodes again with gunfire

CLOSE ON RONALD REAGAN
- a cardboard cut-out planted in a sand dune

YURI and VITALY carry a crate from a taxi onto the desert floor
in

Somalia A group of MUSLIM FREEDOM FIGHTERS eagerly surround the
crate â€”

Yuri hands the Leader an Uzi machine gun

YURI (VO)

Glacier
in the Himalayas

YURI and VITALY in thick parkas emerge from the helicopter into
near-blizzard conditions

YURI (VO)
I sold to both Pakistan and India in their
fight tor the most inhospitable land on
earth

INDIAN TROOPS unseen at first due to their white camouflage

uniforms descend on the chopper - eager to unload the new guns
and

ammunition

Yuri gasps for breath in the thin air An INDIAN SOLDIER gives
Yuri
a hit of oxygen as Vitaly supervises the unloading

YURI
Hows it going

INDIAN COMMANDER
(admiring a new gun)
Were making terrific progress - most
casualties from avalanches and frostbite

YURI
(uncertain smile)

Yuri nods takes another hit of oxygen
EXT BORDER TOWN - CONGO DAY

The town is deserted YURI and VITALY are confused as they
prepare
to unload an arms consignment from a truck

YURI (VO)
We had our set-backs Its not called

Up the street a celebration is taking place - a band balloons
confetti dancing

Finally a Congolese man JOHN CANNIBAL NGAWE appears at the
warehouse

The conversation is in French

YURI
(from the boat)

CANNIBAL
Cease fire man Cease fire Its over
YURI

thick
wad of bills
The Afghani Official smiles He returns to his mud-brick border
station beside the confiscated merchandise

Yuri focuses on a swimsuit calendar hanging on the mud wall -
Miss

following me around We were as
international as each other

EXT FREIGHTER SHIP DAY

We tilt up from the water to find YURI on the deck of a
freighter
ploughing the ballpoint blue seas off the coast of Colombia

North of Barranquilla
Colombia - 1989

YURI (VO)
Operations like mine provided the only way
for certain regimes to conduct a respectable
war

VITALY holds onto a railing trying to stave off seasickness not
helped by standing downwind from Yuris cigarette smoke

YURI (VO)
The freighter I was standing on carried 113
tons of weapons and ammunition for delivery
to one of the poorest nations in Latin
America in direct contravention of half a
dozen international arms embargoes

Yuri makes a call on his cell phone

YURI (VO)
To keep authorities in the dark I often spoke
in code Rocket launchers were mothers the
rockets children Assault rifles were
apples The AK-47 was the Angel King
YURI

Yuri grabs a pair of binoculars On the horizon a fast-
approaching
speed boat - INTERPOL AGENTS visible on the racers deck

VITALY and the CAPTAIN also spying the Customs Boat join Yuri
at
the railing

CAPTAIN
Do we run

VITALY

YURI
No no-ones going anywhere

Slow--dead slow Buy me time

Yuri swings into action frantically dials another number on his
satellite cell phone

YURI (contd)

to the Panamanian flag)
Get that fucking rag down

The CREWMAN hastily complies Yuris call is answered

(trying not to sound too
desperate)
Its Yuri I need another handle for this

pointing to the stern)

The terrified PAINTER makes for the stern where hes hurriedly
winched over
Yuri returns to the phone call

y
nods impressed

Yuri looks forward The Customs Boat has almost reached the bow

the freighter

The flag is hoisted The Painter barely completing the last 0

KONO is hauled back on deck

YURI (contd)

Thats it Everybody look innocent--now

The CREW resume their normal duties as the Customs Boat slows to

crawl itself at close quarters with the freighter

The heavily-armed INTERPOL AGENTS eyeball the rusted vessel

YURI focuses on the senior agent - JACK VALENTINE

While the
agents wear sunglasses long hair tattoo or personalized
uniform

Valentine is completely by the book His Interpol windbreaker
clean

and zipped to the neck

YURI (VO)
They say every man has his price - but not
every man gets it Interpol Agent Jack
Valentine couldnt be bought at least not
with money For Jack glory was the prize

The Customs Boat ominously circles the freighter like a hungry
shark

EXT INTERPOL BOAT DAY
VALENTINE never averts his eyes from the ship

VALENTINE
Not exactly The Love Boat

Another AGENT hands him a phone
VALENTINE (contd)
(into phone)

EXT FREIGHTER INTERPOL BOAT DAY

From the railing YURI watches the Interpol boat draw alongside

the
freighter He surreptitiously makes another phone call

(anxious whisper into phone)
Its Yuri Phone in a sighting of the
Kristol south of Aruba
The boat is secured to the ladder that runs down the side of the
freighter
VALENTINE checks his sidearm climbs the ladder
EXT DECK - FREIGHTER DAY
Yuri spies a life ring emblazoned with the word KRISTOL He
flips

it around as Valentine and the other agents board
Valentine strides past Yuri to a container nods to an agent to

open

it The large metal door opens to reveal a large container full
of

grain - grain spilling onto the deck

Valentine is about to plunge his hand into the grain when a
mobile

phone rings

A CREWMAN calls to Valentine from the bridge of the Interpol
boat

AGENT
(referring to the phone)
Sir sighting of the Kristol due north

Valentine hesitates returns to the ladder

As the agents go they fail to see the pile of grain shift in the
container exposing a crate of assault rifles hidden there

EXT RAILING - FREIGHTER DAY
Yuri and Vitaly watch the Interpol boat leap away

On the FREIGHTER we focus on the terrified PAINTER standing

EXT BARRANQUILLA HARBOR COLOMBIA DAY

YURI and VITALY supervise the unloading of the freighter from the
dockside

They are alerted by the sound of a battle raging somewhere on the
outskirts of the docks

A Jeep full to overflowing with heavily-armed NARCO-GUERRILLAS
suddenly appears at the far end of the dock and speeds towards
A military vehicle full of COLOMBIAN SOLDIERS chases the

Guerrillas

over

several hundred yards behind

The Jeep full of Guerrillas screeches to a stop by the freighter
The NARC LEADER grabs a box of unloaded ammunition

YURI

The Leader smashes the box on the concrete - bullets spilling
everywhere

VITALY
Hey fuck you

NARC LEADER
(jamming his handgun in Vitalys
eye socket)
Fuck you

Yuri tries to play peacemaker
YURI
(reasoning with the Narc Leader)
No you dont fuck him--

The Narc Leader turns and shoots Yuri in the side

Yuri shudders with the impact The enraged Vitaly lunges towards
the Leader but Yuri despite his wound holds him back

YURI (contd)
No Vit No

(to the Leader referring to the
bullets)
Help yourselves Free sample

Vitaly nurses Yuri to the ground

The GUERRILLAS ignore them frantically re-load just in time
immediately start shooting at the approaching government vehicle

The government vehicle throws a vicious 180 almost toppling
The Guerrillas now back in business take off after the
government
troops

Yuri lies on the dock genuinely surprised by the sight of his

own
blood
YURI (VO)
The first and most important rule of
gunrunning is never get shot with your own
merchandise
INT WAREHOUSE - BARRANQUILLA COLOMBIA DAY
YURI now heavily bandaged around the waist and VITALY keep a
watchful eye as the NARC LEADER inspects crates of machine guns
and

other ammunition

YURI (VO)
The second rule is always ensure you have a
foolproof way to get paid Credit card
check cash Preferably in advance ideally
to an off-shore account Its why I choose
my customers so carefully Say what you
like about warlords and dictators they tend
to have a highly developed sense of order
They always pay their bills on time

again)

YURI
I sell guns I dont sell drugs

NARC LEADER
(shrug)
Diversify

The Narc Leader walks away

YURI
(calling after him)
Ive got standards

The Narc Leader ignores him climbs in his Jeep and drives off
The
truck loaded with munitions also exits

Yuri and Vitaly are left alone in their warehouse
VITALY

(staring at their remuneration)
Now what

Yuri shrugs slices open one of the packs of cocaine He takes a
bill from his pocket rolls it into a tube

Hookers still dont rouse)

He exchanges a collegial smile with YURI who has similar
entrepreneurial paraphernalia in front of him

YURI (VO)
By then Id mastered my craft Selling arms

Of course a good arms dealer also has to be
a political scientist I go by a seven-step
approach

where the opposition is ignored

SELLER

YURI (VO)

group and offer them arms

YURI meets a group of REVOLUTIONARIES in a backstreet bar shows
them an arms catalogue

YURI (VO)

you and offer the government arms

YURI meets a GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL in the parliament buildings
shows
him the same catalogue

YURI (VO)
Five Whether they buy or not re-approach
the radical group and offer them more arms
but now at a higher price Increasing
tension is a means of generating demand and
the ideal situation is to sell to both
sides

YURI meets the REVOLUTIONARIES a second time in the same bar -
this
time they are more enthusiastic and Yuri has his calculator out

YURI (VO)
Six If they start shooting at each other
the escalation is underway

They are consuming small arms and ammunition
and the cash register is well and truly
ringing

YURI stands at his hotel window sneaking a look through grimy
venetian blinds A street battle is taking place
However in Yuris mind the sound of the gunshots is gradually

replaced by the sound ot a cash register Each time a gun is
fired

the register rings

Yuri shuts the window

YURI (VO)
Seven Dont forget that the success of a
radical group in one country can inspire a
radical group in a neighboring country

Yuri boards a plane taking off for a new conflict zone
INT AIR MAROC JETLINER DAY

deceit Since thats where they usually end
up anyway its a logical place to start

Youre only remembered when youre dead

Yuri knocks back his vodka tries to lighten the mood

YURI (contd)
Ill bring you back some caviar

ANATOLY

YURI (VO)
Back then I carried a French British Israeli and
Ukrainian passport and a student visa for the

I also packed five different briefcases

visiting

EXT BORDER CHECKPOINT - IZMAYIL UKRAINE DAY

YURI (VO)
The end of the Cold War was the beginning of
the hottest time in arms dealing The Wall
had fallen The arms bazaar was open
Those forty-five years had generated the
highest weapons build-up in history The
Soviets had tanks and guns coming out the
demon hole - huge stockpiles and now no
enemy

EXT ODESSA MILITARY BASE DAY

YURI briefcase in hand meets his Uncle DMITRI at a barracks
(NB

Dmitri always carries a hip flask of vodka as if there is a
constant

threat of radiation poisoning)

DMITRI

Nephew come here and hug the luckiest man
alive

The General gives him a great bear hug Dmitri registers the
apprehensive look on Yuris face

DMITRI (contd)

holiday home at the Black Sea

Dmitri cant deny it

YURI (contd)

(talking like an evangelist)
Its beautiful The ones who know dont

Dmitri hesitates knocks back his vodka then opens the safe -
produces a document

INT ODESSA MILITARY BASE - ARMORY DAY

Crates of machine guns from floor to ceiling DMITRI gives YURI
tour of the armory

YURI
How many Kalashnikovs do you have

DMITRI
(referring to the inventory in
his hand)
40000

YURI
(looking over Dmitris shoulder)
Is that a 4 It doesnt look like a 4
to me It looks more like a 1

DMITRI
(missing the point)
No its a 4
YURI
Its whatever we say it is because no one

else knows the difference

Dmitri finally gets it Yuri examines a Kalashnikov
YURI (contd)
10000 Kalashnikovs for a battalion Your
stocks are dangerously depleted Dmitri
You should order more from the factory

This is too much for Dmitri He stops confronts Yuri - takes
back
the AK-47 Yuri is inspecting

DMITRI
Someone will work this out Yuri What
happens then

YURI
(shrug)
Well cut them in Anyway what could
happen - youre the luckiest man alive

EXT ODESSA MILITARY BASE DUSK

The sun sets over a grassy field YURI sits alone - closely
inspects a Kalashnikov

It is a strange moment between a man and his favorite gun

As we hear Yuris thoughts we are treated to lovingly shot close
ups of the weapon and its features often seen in slow motion

Sun
glistening off the chromed barrel Folding metal stock arcing
elegantly into place Precise docking of the 30-round curved
magazine

YURI (VO)
Avtomat Kalashnikova model of 1947 - more
commonly known as the AK-47 or Kalashnikov
Its the worlds most popular assault ritle
- a weapon all fighters love An elegantly
simple nine pound amalgamation of forged
steel and molded plastic It doesnt break
jam or over-heat It will shoot whether its
covered in mud or filled with sand Its so
easy even a child can use it And they do
The Russians put the gun on a coin
Mozambique put it on their flag Since the
end of the Cold War the Kalashnikov has
become the Russian peoples greatest export
- after that comes vodka and suicidal
novelists One things for sure no one was
lining up to buy their cars

We reveal where Yuri is sitting - on the roof of a rusting
Russian
sedan the Vaz 4-door A goat is eating the upholstery

Yuri checks on the crates of AK-47s being loaded into a convoy
of

trucks In the background the armory full a week ago is now

virtually empty Yuri smiles a satisfied smile

His reverie is interrupted by the sound of a car horn

A commotion at the gate Another large black Mercedes is parked
there DRIVER leaning on the horn

YURI smiles as he sees the passenger emerge from the car - SIMEON
ZAHAROFF

YURI (VO)
Of course my idea was not entirely unique
I had rivals

Simeon angrily confronts the SOLDIER at the gate
DMITRI puts on his cap about to investigate YURI stops him

YURI
Hes a friend of mine

Dmitri shrugs and complies Yuri strides towards the gate
EXT ODESSA MILITARY BASE - GATE DUSK

SIMEON flanked by two hefty BODYGUARDS is in the face of a
YOUNG
OFFICER

The Officer is flanked by three SOLDIERS Kalashnikovs resting on
their hips

SIMEON
Do you know who the fuck I am

OFFICER
(thick Ukrainian accent)
Who the fuck cares who the fuck you are

SIMEON
I demand to see your commanding officer

OFFICER
You dont demand shit

Simeon reconsiders his position
SIMEON
Just give me back my papers

OFFICER
(papers clearly visible in his
hand)
What papers

The Officer turns on his heel and returns to his guard station
with

the passport starts watching TV The Bodyguards make to follow
but

the Soldiers close ranks barring their path

Simeon fumes

YURI (0C)
Youre late Simeon

YURI breezes past the Soldiers with an easy familiarity He
enters
the guard station as if he owns it

From beside his car Simeon watches as Yuri jovially discusses
the

situation with the Young Officer After a moment Yuri slips the

Officer money in exchange for Simeons passport

Yuri emerges from the station and returns the passport to the
veteran gunrunner

YURI (contd)
I invited you for a drink once before
Perhaps now you will accept my invitation

INT ODESSA HOTEL BAR NIGHT

YURI and SIMEON sit at a table near the back of the bar Yuri
flirts with
the BARMAID delivering drinks and a shellfish appetizer

BARMAID
(to Yuri impressed)
You sell guns

YURI
Maybe youd like to come to my room and see

my bazooka

The Barmaid giggles and exits
Simeon is clearly disquieted by the change in the balance of

power or
maybe its the bad early-nineties pop music His BODYGUARDS sit

at the table behind

YURI
You look a little lost Simeon Is the
world changing too fast

SIMEON
I am here arent I

YURI
Not all of you I think

Simeons look begs explanation

YURI (contd)
Youve gotten so rich selling for the CIA
you cant get that ideology completely out
of your head The empire was evil for too
long

Simeon shrugs

SIMEON
I cant deny it takes some getting used to
Last week we were trying to beat their
brains in and now were going into business
together

YURI
Theres no place in gunrunning for politics
anymore Simeon I sell to leftists
rightists Id sell to pacifists but
theyre not the most regular of customers

Yuri leans forward

YURI (contd)
Of course youre not a true internationalist
until youve supplied weapons to kill your own
countrymen

Simeon regards the young man with a mixture of fear and
admiration pours
himself another drink

SIMEON
I understand you have Ukraine in your pocket
but there are the other satellite states
Bulgaria Hungary Poland Belarus Instead
of cutting each others throats it may be
more profitable to work together What do
you think

Yuri smiles - the proposal is the victory he has been seeking

YURI
I think you are the amateur now I think
you suffer from a philosophical disadvantage
- you have a philosophy I think you should
go with your instincts - your first
instinct

Simeon is confused

YURI (contd)
I am the same man who was not good enough
for you before I am not good enough for
you now

Simeon blanches Yuri gets up
Simeon holds his rivals arm

SIMEON
The problem with gunrunners going to war is
theres no shortage of ammunition

Yuri departs

YURI
What about tech support

UKRAINE MAJOR
No problem

Yuri and Dmitri come upon an oily-faced BOY perched on the
cockpit

of a helicopter gunship - he wears an ill-fitting uniform
several

sizes too big

YURI
Son get off there before you get hurt

VALENTINE at a surprise checkpoint staring through binoculars

of
his own

YURI (0C)
Who are you
YURI on his belly to avoid detection slithers back to the

roadway

view

- hands the binoculars to a YOUNG SOLDIER
DMITRI stands beside the convoy of trucks parked barely out of

of the checkpoint including Yuris Mercedes and a huge open-bed
tractor-trailer carrying a Russian Hind helicopter gunship

YURI (contd)
(angrily to Dmitri)
I thought we were supposed to be watching
for these checkpoints

DMITRI
How can I You keep selling my helicopters
Youre too greedy Yuri

YURI
(anxious)
We have to go back

Dmitri regards the trucks each one longer than the road is wide

DMITRI
Well be going in reverse We cant turn
around for a mile

The YOUNG SOLDIER on lookout calls to them

YOUNG SOLDIER
Theyre coming

Yuri grabs the binoculars Sure enough Valentine and his agents
are climbing into their Interpol Jeeps and driving towards them

DMITRI
We shoot it out

YURI
(shaking his head)
And start an international fucking incident
- no no no

DMITRI
So we run

YURI
No Ive got paperwork

DMITRI

Not for the gunship Yuri you know the

penalty for sanction-busting - selling a

military helicopter
Yuri gazes at the Russian Mi-24V helicopter gunship bristling
armaments

YURI
Its not a military helicopter Its a
rescue helicopter

Yuri turns to the Boy referred to as tech support

YURI (cant d)
Get to work Son

The boy pulls a wrench from his pocket

SEVERAL MINUTES LATER

The Interpol Jeeps crest the rise and pull in front of the convoy
VALENTINE and his agents exit guns drawn

DMITRI and the UKRAINIAN SOLDIERS stiffen their weapons also at
ready An uneasy stand-off

YURI gestures for calm He greets Valentine warmly - offers his
hand

YURI
Yuri Orlov

In reply an Interpol Agent unceremoniously slams Yuri into the
of his truck

VALENTINE

(flashing ID)
Papers

Again Yuri waves off Dmitri and his men about to come to his
Yuri courteously hands over his passport and other documentation
the skeptical Valentine

VALENTINE (contd)

(regarding the photo closely)
Mr Orlov always in the wrong place at the
its

right time Weve met before Off the
coast of Colombia

(feigning memory loss)
What was the name of that freighter - I
cant remember Was it the Kono or the
Kristol

YURI
(hesitates hes actually forgotten)
The crew called that vessel a lot of names - none of
them repeatable in polite company

Valentine turns his attention to the helicopter - now devoid of
weapons An Interpol Agent escorts Yuri at gunpoint

YURI (contd)
(noting to the gun in his ribs)
The new MP-5 Do you need a silencer for
that

Valentine ignores the banter inspects Yuris documentation

VALENTINE
The end-user certificate for this aircraft
states Burkina Faso Nice Did you type it
yourself

YURI
Its for humanitarian missions

VALENTINE
Youre a humanitarian

Yuri shrugs - why not

VALENTINE (contd)
(not buying it for a second)
This is a killing machine

YURI
Not any more

DMITRI
(in broken English)
Listen to the nephew

Its true Yuri has had the armaments detached
YURI

Didnt you get the memo The wars over
What can they do with military hardware but
in

convert to civilian use

DMITRI
What yes

YURI
(trying to lighten the mood)
The only way you could die from this baby is
if a food drop hits you

Valentines face hardens at the flippant remark
Still at gunpoint Yuri is escorted to the smaller second truck

the convoy Stacked inside the container are the helicopters
hurriedly removed missiles and the Boy

VALENTINE
(referring to the missiles)
Also going to Burkina Faso

YURI
(pointing to the document)
But to a different client at a different
address

Valentine incensed throws Yuri up against the truck himself

VALENTINE
What do you take me for A complete fucking
fool

YURI

(eyeing Valentines gun pressed to

his throat)
Not complete Sir And while I hesitate to
tell you your job I must point out that
when shipped separately the weapons and the
aircraft both comply with the current
Interpol trade standards and practices

VALENTINE
(incredulous)
You expect me to believe this isa
coincidence

YURI
I can see how certain people might interpret
it as suspicious but thank God we live ina
world where suspicion alone does not
constitute a crime
Valentine regards Yuri closely - this foe is more formidable than
he

imagined

Valentine looks to the gun in his hand contemplating crossing
the

line He finally holsters his gun

VALENTINE
(tosses the documents on the road)
Yuri Orlov You and I are going to be
seeing a lot of each other

YURI
I can hardly wait

VALENTINE

Watch out for the time you dont see me

Yuri Dmitri and the Boy watch Valentine speed away

Yuri looks to the boy askance - a Yuri in the making

EXT ODESSA HARBOR DAY

YURI supervises the loading of the cargo onto a freighter
Checking

the empty trucks he is just in time to see SIMEON and his
HENCHMEN

climb into their car parked beside his own car some distance
away

As he drives off Simeon and Yuri make brief eye-contact

Yuri looks for DMITRI exiting a nearby restroom - carrying his
hip
flask as usual the worse for drink

YURI
(referring to the departing
Simeon)
What was he doing here

DMITRI
(zipping his pants)
Trying to beat your offer I sent him on
his way He doesnt understand the concept

of loyalty
Dmitri glances at the SOLDIERS around the docks
DMITRI (contd)
Speaking of loyalty too many people know
I have to make pay-offs
YURI
Dont worry Therere more VCRs I left
them in your new car
Dmitris face lights up Yuri hands him the keys to the SKL
DMITRI
Even your enemy was admiring that car I am

Dmitri hands his hip flask to Yuri Yuri watches Dmitri walk to
car and climb in for a test drive
A look of realization on Yuris face

The car erupts as if it has been punched by a fist beneath the
earth

Recovered from the blast Yuri runs up to the burning car but is
beaten back by the flames

arms have been stolen and re-sold One of
the greatest heists of the 20th Century

EXT DOCKSIDE - MONROVIA DAY

Crates of munitions are unloaded from the freighter onto waiting
trucks under YURIs supervision

The primary market was Africa Eleven major
conflicts
involving 32 countries in the past decade - a
gunrunners wet dream

Yuri sizes up the MILITIAMEN loading the arms

YURI (VO)
My best customer was self-declared president
of Liberia Andre Baptiste Even though
wed met before I was in no hurry to meet
him again Hed gotten a reputation for
routinely hacking off the limbs of those who
opposed him His seven-year civil war has
been described as a relentless campaign of
sadistic wanton violence unimaginable to
those unfamiliar with the details of mans
capacity to visit the abyss That kind of
sums up Andy for me

As the final truck door is secured a customized Lincoln
Continental convertible comes flying around a corner - stereo
blaring deliberately terrorizing the locals on the dock

The car slides to a stop beside Yuri It contains ANDRE BAPTISTE
JNR a handsome young man with sunglasses a mirror for an
earring and a facial tattoo Also in the car two BODYGUARDS and
a pair of LIBERIAN TEENAGE GIRLS dressed in Dallas Cowboy
cheerleader uniforms

ANDRE JNR
Mr Yuri I am Andre Baptiste Junior My
father would like to meet you

YURI
Thank him but I have other business A busy
schedule

ANDRE JNR
It is not optional My father is easily
offended

Yuri ponders for a moment The machete in the Bodyguards hand
makes up his mind

YURI
What do you know My schedule just freed up

A bodyguard takes Yuris suitcase Yuri is barely in the car
before
it screeches away

As the car roars along the highway on the edge of control we
hear
Yuris thoughts

YURI (VO)
But if I thought I was scared of Andre
Senior I knew I was scared of Andre Junior
Like father like son The guava doesnt
fall too far from the tree He was a heavy-
drinker a womanizer with a penchant for
cheerleaders and a lover of fast American
automobiles which he drove recklessly and
with total impunity around the streets of
the capital Oh yes he was also a
cannibal They say Andre would eat a
victims heart while it was still beating to
give him superhuman strength I couldve
told him hed get the same effect froma
pastrami sandwich at Carnegies Deli

Andre announces his arrival in the main street of Monrovia with a

burst of gunfire The city a violent clash of cultures Goats
and

Gucci

YURI (VO)
Monrovia itself was like being on another
planet Planet Monrovia From the
temperature it was obviously a planet close
to the sun I rarely saw another white man
even at my hotel that was soon dubbed the
Little Kremlin And I never left town
alone Outside town was the edge of hell
I didnt want to even gaze into it

The car pulls up to Monrovias premier hotel A DEAD BODY on the
ground attracts no attention whatsoever

ostentatious

mahogany desk in front of President of Liberia ANDRE BAPTISTE -
a few

pounds heavier still wearing the same size uniform ANDRE JNR
watches

over his shoulder
Andre Baptiste examines each handgun methodically

In front of him a pensive YURI taking in his surroundings
Half a

dozen gun-toting ELITE GUARDS keep an idle watch Several
HOSTESSES tend

to a refreshments table On a nearby sofa a LIEUTENANT flirts
with one

of the hostesses

Baptiste glances over to the Lieutenant irritated

YURI
(providing a commentary)
--thats the Beretta comes with a 36
cartridge easy-operating clip--

Baptiste tests the loading mechanism
The Lieutenant on the sofa is still not paying attention

Baptiste casually points the gun at the Lieutenant and shoots him
in

the head - a large portion of his brain splattering across the

fleur-de-lis wallpaper

YURI (contd)
(shocked)
Jesus why did you do that

Baptiste clearly not used to having his actions questioned
turns
the gun on Yuri Hes next

BAPTISTE
What did you say

Yuri staring down the barrel of the Beretta recovers fast

YURI
(feigning anger gesturing at the
gun)
Now youre going to have to buy it
(grabbing the gun from Baptiste)
Its a used gun I cant sell a used gun

Baptiste is taken aback He suddenly bursts into laughter

BAPTISTE
A used gun Thats a good one
The other Officers laugh uncertainly

The Lieutenants body is dragged out - leaving a smear of blood
across the marble floor

Baptiste seemingly oblivious to the carnage hes wreaked
resumes

talking to Yuri in a measured way as if hes discussing the sad

state of punctuality in contemporary society

BAPTISTE (cantd)
(confiding in Yuri)
Theres no discipline with the young boys
I try to set an example but its difficult
I blame the MTV

Baptiste checking his Rolex Oyster rises from his desk

BAPTISTE (contd)

EXT BAPTISTES PRESIDENTIAL MANSION DAY

The camera tracks along the MILITIA - however only the very tops
of
their heads are visible

YURI (VO)
I had heard of the Boy Brigades Small
Boy Units Kalashnikov Kids The theory
was that a bullet coming from a fourteen
year old is just as effective as one trom a
forty year old

ANDRE BAPTISTE haggles with YURI as he inspects his troops
ranging

from twelve to fourteen Yuri averts his eyes from the boys

uncomfortable reviewing soldiers a head shorter than he

OLDER SOLDIERS fill the ranks behind
BAPTISTE

I cant pay your asking price Yuri We are
not a rich people and the market is already

flooded with your Kalashnikovs In some
places you can buy one for the price of a
chicken

YURI

You cant just look at the unit price You
forget the ancillary costs End user
certificates need to be forged and
notarized shell companies set up insurance
purchased pilots and crews hired Not to
mention the bribes You cant get a nut

and bolt out of the Eastern bloc without a
bribe Theres one bribe for the nut
Another for the bolt This is an expensive
proposition

Andre interrogates Yuris eyes

BAPTISTE
I pay in timberor stones

Baptiste produces a handful of uncut diamonds from his pocket
Yuris eyes
widen at the sight of the very precious stones

(regarding the stones)
Ill take the stones Its hard to get a

(referring to the inspection)
Very professional Lieutenant

LIEUTENANT
(dismissing the troops)
Dismissed

Yuri and Andre watch the troops disperse

YURI
I know youre planning a new offensive If
you delay a week I can get you the armored
personnel carriers we talked about They
would give you a significant strategic
advantage

Andre nods grateful for the free tactical advice - regards Yuri
in
a new light
BAPTISTE

They say I am the lord of war But perhaps
it is you

YURI
(correcting him)
Its not lord of war Its warlord

BAPTISTE
I like it my way

Andre smiles again They are going to be fast friends
He leaves Yuri alone to examine his uncut diamonds in his hand

YURI (VO)
Diamonds are far less bulky than hundred-
dollar bills You can get a million dollars
into a cigarette box

EXT ART GALLERY - MANHATTAN DUSK

A GO-BETWEEN emerges from a gallery with a wrapped painting

hands it to
YURI waiting in a limo

YURI (VO)
By the mid-nineties my wealth had caught up
to my lies about my wealth - even surpassed
the lies

Yuri pays the Go-Between in cash places the painting in the
trunk

VITALY in the background cocktail in hand with another

dubious-
looking GIRLFRIEND is examining another of Avas paintings

AVA
Yuri I just got off the phone with the
dealer I sold my first painting

Yuri and Vitaly greet each other with a nod

YURI
(feigning surprise)
Fantastic Who bought it

AVA
Someone important They want to remain

anonymous
(asking in a way that does not
expect an answer)
How was your trip

YURI
You know Same old same old
(quickly changing the subject)
Wheres Nicki in bed

AVA
Im sorry Poor darling He tried to stay
up

YURI

Ill kiss him goodnight

VITALY
(opening champagne)
This calls for a drink

YURI
What doesnt

AVA
(still giddy at the news)
My first painting Im officially an
artist

He watches Ava showing off more of her paintings to Vitaly and
the
latest girlfriend

YURI (VO)
I figured I was a patron of the arts and of
everything else Ava had tried and failed at
after modelling Acting her own cosmetics
line I didnt sabotage her careers but I
cant deny it was convenient for me in
maintaining a low profile She was a
beautiful bird in a gilded cage

INT BEDROOM - NEW YORK APARTMENT NIGHT
YURI kisses his sleeping son NICOLAI now three years old

He places a gift at the end of his bed - an expensive-looking
microscope

At the same time he spies an object in Nicolais toy box - a toy
gun

INT KITCHEN LIVING ROOM - NEW YORK APARTMENT NIGHT
YURI tosses the toy gun in the trash

VITALY still in the kitchen catches him - pretends he didnt

see
YURI
How are you brother

You know still the resident family fuck-up
YURI
Someone has to do it
They watch Ava in the living room sharing a joke with Vitalys
girlfriend
VITALY
She knows right
YURI
We dont talk about it
Vitaly looks askance
YURI (contd)
(shrug)
How many car salesmen talk about their work
how many executives at cigarette companies
And both of their products kill more people
every year than mine At least mine has a
safety switch If those guys can leave
their work at the office why cant I
VITALY
Shit youre good You almost had me
convinced
(to his girlfriend knocking back
his drink)
Were going baby
LATER
Yuri and Ava are alone at the window overlooking Central Park
He

hands her a fresh glass of champagne

YURI
(raising his glass for a toast)
To Manet Monetand Ava Cordova

earrings
laying at the bottom of the glass

I know just the outfit

They kiss
INT BEDROOM - NEW YORK APARTMENT NIGHT

CLOSE UP on the diamonds dangling from AVAs ears She wears the
earrings and nothing else as she and YURI make love

I didnt know how much she knew and how much
she ignored I was a good provider and as
far as she was concerned - loyal Despite
the other women I always made love to Ava
as if she was the only one

He closes the roof

INT COCKPIT - ILYUSHIN-76 CARGO PLANE DAY

The cargo hold of an Ilyushin-76 cargo plane Its so

overflowing

on

Journal

with weapons many are strapped into the passenger seats

Sierra Leone -

YURI (VO)
I was now the best merchant of death alive I
didnt own my own plane I owned a fleet -
running guns into Liberia Sierra Leone or the
Ivory Coast at least once a week
Unfortunately my friends at Interpol were
also starting to find West Africa on the map
Most trips I had phoney paperwork If the
deadline was tight I had no paperwork at all

In the cockpit an American PILOT and CO-PILOT keep an idle watch

their instruments as they fly over the endless plains of Sierra
Leone YURI sits in the jump-seat reading the Wall Street

PILOT
(to his co-pilot)
--Even taking into consideration the pay-off
to the parents a week with a girl in
Burkina Faso is cheaper than a night witha
girl in Jersey

CO-PILOT
Plus theyre cleaner--

PILOT
--and a lot of them speak better English

CO-PILOT
(shrug)
Personally I prefer a language barrier--

An unmarked military jet appears through the starboard window
The

voice on the radio is familiar

VALENTINE (0C)
--Charlie Echo India Descend for landing
on heading zerotwonine

The Pilot picks up the radio looks to Yuri Yuri shakes his
head

dialling his satellite phone Yuris call is answered

YURI
(into phone trying not to sound
too desperate)
Colonel Southern its Yuri Sorry to call
you on this number but Ive got an Interpol
jet and--

The jet outside the window falls back

INT A PENTAGON OFFICE DAY

A mid-rank office dominated by a computer terminal We look over
COLONEL SOUTHERNs shoulder He is admiring a new medal Two
other MEN

IN SUITS sit opposite

COL SOUTHERN
(into phone measured voice)

I cant know you right now Its not a good
time

Southern hangs up
INT COCKPIT - ILYUSHIN-76 CARGO PLANE DAY
YURI hearing the response explodes
YURI
(gaping at the phone in disbelief)
Not a good time
Suddenly machine gun fire strafes the Ilyushin - bullets tearing

through the fuselage perilously close to Yurirs very combustible
cargo
CO-PILOT
Motherfucker

The jet appears again at the window

VALENTINE
(radio)
--Charlie Echo India Comply immediately
That was your last warning

YURI
Where was the first fucking warning

VALENTINE
(radio)
Rock your wings if you intend to comply

PILOT
(to Yuri anxious)
Im putting us down

YURI
(incredulous)
You land and were all going away I dont
have paperwork

PILOT
(incredulous)
Were in a flying fucking bomb Theyre
firing bullets at our bullets Forget about
going away They shoot again were going
away for good Im putting us down

YURI
(knowing hes right)
Okay Okay--Fuck

The pilot responds on the radio

PILOT
(into radio)
This is Charlie Echo India Descending
on heading zero two nine

The Interpol jet takes the lead towards a small airport
surveys the
terrain below getting his head back in the game

YURI
(pointing out a narrow highway)
Not the airport There The highway Its

Yuri
dry

side

our only fucking hope

PILOT
(concerned)
A pothole could set us off

YURI
Dont underestimate yourself Youre the
best Tony

The pilot doesnt buy it but reluctantly changes course anyway
INT INTERPOL JET DAY

From his own wingseat VALENTINE observes the Ilyushins detour
landing on the highway

INTERPOL PILOT
I cant land there

VALENTINE
(to the pilot)
He cant get far I want a truck waiting on
the tarmac

EXT HIGHWAY DAY

A heavily-trafficked highway WOMEN carrying water jars on their
heads a thin COW pulling the carcass of a car VENDORS selling

meat CHILDREN playing war games

The pedestrians look up to see the lumbering Ilyushin making its
final approach - they scatter

The Ilyushin weaves on landing hits a bone-jarring pothole

INSIDE THE PLANE - boxes of grenades bullets and other munitions
jump dangerously up and down

Finally the Ilyushin pulls up safely on the highway engines
shutting down YURIs head appears out of the cockpit window

Curious LOCALS recovered from the shock are gathering at the
of the road
YURI
(to the pilots sizing up the

locals)
Were going to be okay
him

The PILOTS are already halfway out of the plane door grabbing
supplies as they go

YURI (contd)
(calling out from the window)

Where are you going

PILOT
As far from the evidence as I can

The pilots start running down the highway
YURI
Wait you idiots Theres not going to be
any evidence Stay with the plane
The pilots ignore him - run for their lives
YURI is left alone He turns a lever marked CARGO BAY

EXT CARGO BAY DAY

The rear cargo bay opens YURI stands beside his incriminating
merchandise

YURI
(to the gathering locals)
Help yourselves Be my guest No charge
One LOCAL MAN tentatively approaches the cargo bay Yuri hands

an AK-47 and a box of shells

More SIERRA LEONESE LOCALS emerge from the side of the road
seemingly out of thin air

Yuri hands out more guns
YURI (contd)
(to other locals)

Take the whole crate
Two men oblige ferrying the crate away
The other locals become bolder then brazen
Soon its a free-far-all Men women and children swarm all over
the plane pilfering the arms and anything else that isnt bolted

down - also a lot that is

Yuri has to exit the plane to avoid being trampled in the rush
EXT HIGHWAY DAY

YURI buys a Fanta from a vendor - exchanging it for a box of
grenades

He sits on a soda crate for a front row seat at the chaos
Yuri has a calculator out - totalling his losses
YURI
(muttering under his breath
shutting off the calculator in
disgust)
What a fucking disaster
Yuri sees the pilot seats being stolen
YURI
Hey not those You dont touch the plane
(plaintive moan)

Not the fucking seats

Glancing up the highway Yuri sees an approaching cloud of dust -
VALENTINE and two truckfuls of heavily-armed Interpol Agents

Too late The last of the guns and ammunition are being carted
away

on the back of a thin cow

Valentines truck fishtails to a halt beside the stripped plane

Valentine is first off the trucks and into the planes cargo bay

empty

Other INTERPOL AGENTS fan out - futilely questioning locals

Miraculously the weapons have vanished into the bush

Valentine calls out to the last fleeing local - a BOY with a
lifevest

VALENTINE
Hey you

The boy stares back defiantly inflates the life preserver
VALENTINE (contd)
(exasperated)

Forget it

The entire cargo has gone An errant bullet falls off a shelf in
the plane and rolls down the floor - Valentine picks it up
YURI sits innocently on his soda crate

A frustrated African Interpol Agent MBIZI wound-up by the
chase
rushes Yuri - slams him to the ground

MBIZI
You run from us
(flashing a machete in Yuris
face)
Can you run with no legs

Valentine rushes over pulls Mbizi off Yuri

VALENTINE
No Mbizi No no no

Valentine drags Mbizi out of Yuris earshot Mbizi still wants a
piece of Yuri - Valentine preventing him getting to the
gunrunner

MBIZI
Let me disappear him Mr Valentine He is
a devil Let me disappear him

VALENTINE
I cant do that

MBIZI
Look where we are Who will know

VALENTINE
We will

Mbizi stops struggling against Valentine

MBIZI
Turn your back Mr Valentine I will go to
hell to stop him

VALENTINE
(gently)
No
(to his Agents)
Find the pilots

Mbizi and another Agent reluctantly head off in a truck

Valentine returns to Yuri who is dusting himself off Valentine
handcuffs Yuri himself picks up the soda crate and sits Yuri
back
on it

VALENTINE (contd)
Ive spent my whole career on the right side
of the line Youre the first man Ive
encountered who makes me seriously consider
crossing it

YURI
Whats the charge

VALENTINE
What are you doing in Sierra Leone

YURI
Im on safari

VALENTINE
(referring to the bullet)
Shooting wildebeests with submachine guns

YURI
Are you with the park service Hunting
without a license - is that the charge

VALENTINE
Youre trafficking arms

YURI

Trading But without evidence who can say
VALENTINE
rade or traffic you make a fortune by
eeping the poorest people on the planet
illing each other

(hesitates unsure whether to

waste his breath - wastes it

anyway)
Do you know why I do what I do

fq

Yuri remains handcuffed sitting on the soda crate - dwarfed by
the
cargo plane Valentine paces beside him

VALENTINE (contd)
(ignoring him)
There are more prestigious assignments you
know Keeping track of the nuclear
arsenals You would think it more critical
to world security Its not Nine out of
ten war victims today are killed by assault
rifles and other small arms - like yours
Those missiles just sit in their silos
Your AK-47 - its the real weapon of mass
destruction

Yuri regards his interrogator curiously Despite the sun beating
down he feels obliged to give him his version of the facts of
life

YURI
I dont want people dead Agent Valentine
I admit a shooting war is better for
business But Id prefer people to fire my
guns and miss Just as long as theyre
firing

He regards Valentine with something approaching pity

YURI (contd)
I realize the unspeakable things that are
done with my weapons I also understand the
unspeakable things that are done with
Williams Sonoma carving knives and Wilson
baseball bats and they arent taking those
off the market any time soon People will
always buy guns Why not mine

Valentine appears to have no answer

YURI (contd)
Can I go Youve got nothing on me--
(unable to resist)
--but cuffs

Now Valentine smiles

VALENTINE
I am legally permitted to hold you for
twenty-four hours without charging you

Yuri looks away knows where this is going

VALENTINE (contd)

You may ask why do I bother to do that I
can assure you it is not because I enjoy your
company And you may be surprised to learn
that it is not for any vindictive motive No
The reason I delay you for every second of the
permissible twenty-four hours is that I am
delaying your deadly trade and the deaths of
your victims I dont think of it as taking a
day from you but giving a day to them Some
innocent man woman or child somewhere has one
more day on this earth because you are not
free

Valentine looks to his watch
VALENTINE (contd)
See you in twenty-three hours and fifty five

minutes

Valentine walks away Yuri is left to ponder the notion

We see time lapse photography of Yuri waiting out his twenty-

hours under armed guard on the highway - stretching his legs

eating a suspicious-looking sandwich going to the bathroom
sun

arcing across the sky - all the while his plane is being

cannibalized by the locals Finally the time lapse slows bac
into

real time
Valentine returns in a Jeep with Mbizi and other Agents

VALENTINE
Youll be pleased to know your colleagues
were no more co-operative than you

Valentine opens the back of the Jeep Lying in the back the
bodies
of the two PILOTS shot and stripped

VALENTINE (contd)
The locals got to them before we could

Yuri turns away from the sight His handcuffs are removed

Returning Yuris documents Valentine notices a photo of AVA and

NICKI in the wallet

VALENTINE (contd)
Handsome family

Valentine and the Agents get back in the truck and drive away

EXT HIGHWAY DUSK

YURI starts to walk down the deserted highway alone - his cargo

plane is now just another carcass in the jungle

A CONVOY of armored personnel carriers barrels past him - the

Uh yes In fact Ive just had some
transport problems You couldnt give me a

Yuri steps back into a vehicle with which he is very familiar

Its a shame We were really doing some
good things
Yuri nods in understanding
INT HOTEL AFRICA - YURIS HOTEL ROOM NIGHT
A weary YURI enters his room Sitting on the green sofa - bound
and

gagged face reduced to pulp silver hair matted with blood -
SIMEON

YURI
Jesus Simeon

ANDRE JNR a FLUNKY and his CHEERLEADERS appear from behind the
door laughing at his shocked reaction

YURI (contd)
Andre What in heaven is he doing here

ANDRE JNR
A gift for you

Yuri stares into the old gunrunners terrified eyes

ANDRE JNR (contd)

You got here just in time I was afraid he
would die before you got a chance to kill
him

He offers Yuri a Beretta

YURI
Me

ANDRE JNR
Who do you think informed on you - cost you your
plane He came to meet my father hoping to take
your place

Yuri spits on Simeon

YURI
You stupid old fuck

ANDRE JNR
(knowing smile)
He killed your man when he tried to kill
you

Andre again offers Yuri the Beretta

YURI
No

ANDRE JNR
(confused)
You want us to let him go

YURI
No No I

Andre offers him the gun a third time Yuri refuses it
ANDRE JNR

So you do want him dead You just dont
want to kill him yourself I understand
Andre grabs Yuri and presses the gun into Yuris palm clasping
his
own hand over Yuris

ANDRE JNR
Well do it together A bonding experience

Andre forces Yuris finger onto the trigger as he aims at the
terrified Simeon - eyes pleading

Yuri attempts to pull his hand away but Andre is too strong

ANDRE JNR
You can stop if you want - but
you do Just say the word

Andre stares at Yuri not Simeon

ANDRE JNR (contd)
Say stop

Yuri opens his mouth but no word comes Andre presses Yuris
finger
onto the trigger

The gun goes off A splash of blood across the sofas green
upholstery

The gunshot echoes around the room Simeon is very dead

YURI
(quietly)
Stop

Andre smiles

ANDRE JNR
(surveying the blood-spattered
room)
Ill get you another room with a nicer view

INT HOTEL AFRICA - LIBERIA DAY

YURI collapses on the bar - gestures to the BARMAN who
immediately
pours a line of cocaine in full view

YURI hoovers it up

YURI (VO)
I started doing a lot of cocaine in West
Africa I wasnt medicating myself I was
simply playing catch-up I was constantly
dealing with people who are chemically
imbalanced without the aid of chemicals
Its just a matter of etiquette Its rude
to act sane in a room full of lunatics

The Barman nods to a patron at a corner table - a SEASONED
FIGHTER

- no more than eighteen years old

BARMAN
He bought you brown-brown Mr Yuri

YURI
(wiping his nose)
What

BARMAN
Brown-brown

YURI
What is it

BARMAN
(laughs)
A mixture - cocaine and gunpowder

YURI
What does the gunpowder do

BARMAN
Its magic They give it to the small boys
before battle - they do anything

YURI
Some other time

BARMAN
You have to try it at least once Mr Yuri

The Barman starts chopping another line

YURI
Why

BARMAN
(laughing)
Because its your gunpowder

Sure enough the Barman pours the gunpowder from one of Yuris
39mm
shells into the cocaine

The SEASONED FIGHTER assault rifle slung over his shoulder

intimidating air sidles up to Yuri - stares him down Yuri has
no

option does a line

He washes it down with a swig from a vodka bottle raises his
glass
to the fighter

The Barman puts on a Ukrainian folk song Yuri picks out one of
the
PROSTITUTES in the bar starts dancing

He drunkenly dances with one PROSTITUTE after another - the dance

almost violent the prostitutes flung aside none lasting more
than

a few seconds - caught in the arms of the other PATRONS

To Yuri the bar swims before his eyes
The music stops Yuri wild-eyed looks at the stunned bar room

YURI
(to no one in particular whipping his
vodka bottle off the bar)

A ROOM WITH A CURVED CEILING ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF MONROVIA
YURI eyes unable to focus stares at a WOMANS FACE in front of
him moving back and forth The gyrating stops
Yuri realizes he is lying in the mouth of an enormous cement pipe
on

his back a prostitute on top of him She gets to her feet
adjusting her dress

Yuri panics hurriedly zipping himself
YURI
(a mixture of French and English)
I didnt fuck you did I Did I fuck you

PROSTITUTE
(in French as she counts Yuris
money)
Its not what I would call a fuck

The prostitute tosses a couple of bills back to him Yuri
ignores
the money staggers after her

YURI
Are you sick

She ignores him

YURI (contd)
(screaming)
Are you sick

Yuri staggers to his feet - wanders aimlessly across a field
A DANCE IN DUST SOMEWHERE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF MONROVIA

Two dozen pairs of feet chase each other on a dirt field to
cheers

from a crowd The dust clears revealing a bundle of cloth and

string doubling as a soccer ball The game is between two

indistinguishable teams of MONROVIAN YOUNGSTERS on a makeshift
dirt

field goalposts constructed from tree branches lashed together

YURI wanders onto the field joins the game without asking The
players humor him by letting him have the ball

Yuri dribbles up field takes an enormous swipe at the ball
misses
completely clattering to the ground

The crowd and players laugh The game goes on Yuri also
laughing

but in a far more desperate manner picks himself up and wanders

away

A LIBERIAN BAR CALLED ZANZI-BAR

YURI throws up at the back of a saloon flimsily constructed from
rusted corrugated iron
Rinsing out his mouth with vodka he is distracted by the sound
of
two little GIRLS arguing

hands politely behind their backs

Sir will my fingers grow back

One of the girls shows Yuri a healed stump where her hand should
be

Yuri runs away
A MODERN SCULPTURE SOMEWHERE IN MONROVIA

YURI passes in front of an abstract arrangement of holes that
turns
out to be a building pock-marked with gunshells

Suddenly a FACE appears in one of the holes - SIMEON The
gunshot
wound in his forehead still evident Yuri gasps

YURI
Simeon

Simeon turns and walks away - revealing a large exit wound in the
back
of his head

YURI (contd)
Simeon

Yuri pokes his head through the hole but Simeon has vanished
Yuri

turns back to find himself trapped by TWO MEN in flip-flops
shorts

Gap T-shirts and AK-47s

Through Yuris eyes the two men look like four The twofour men
go
through Yuris pockets take his watch shoes

Yuri is oddly compliant - clumsily helping one of the thieves
fasten
the watch

One of the men tired of Yuris antics aims his gun at Yuris
head
His colleague stops him

MAN 1
Dont Hes Andres

MAN 2
(keeping his gun raised)
Fuck Andre
YURI

(seemingly beyond caring)
Yeah fuck Andre

The man fires at Yuri The gun jams Yuri looks almost
disappointed The man tries again Again the gun jams

YURI
(referring to the gun)
Im sorry They dont usually do that Let
me have a look Maybe I can fix it

MAN 1
(disgusted)
Fuck off

The man whips the gun across Yuris face

A PATH OUTSIDE MONROVIA

YURI face streaked with blood and dirt wanders aimlessly
through
the brush outside Monrovia

A HYENA appears on the dirt path in front of him - teeth bared
frenzied eyes

Yuri stares at the wild dog - starts to quietly cry Tears roll
down his cheeks

The hyena runs away Yuri is alone

to

uncanny double)

a pouch of uncut diamonds

millisecond too fast)

Ava picks up the dress off the bed
Yuri gazes at her

By the way youre wrong about not being

She turns back and smiles

EXT FIFTH AVENUE AT CENTRAL PARK EAST DAY

A YOUNG INTERPOL AGENT carrying a tray of coffee approaches a
plain panel van parked outside Yuris apartment building

YURI (VO)
For the next month I stopped running guns

The van door opens to reveal VALENTINE and other INTERPOL AGENTS
wearing headsets monitoring a scanner device The agents read
porn to keep themselves amused - except Valentine

YURI (VO)
No wonder Valentine was confused

INT UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT DUSK
YURI toys with his old BULLET pendant as he talks on the phone

For once the spreadsheets in front of him deal with oil and
timber

YURI (VO)
Thank God there are still legal ways to

exploit developing countries

With the cordless phone to his ear Yuri wanders to the kitchen

He
tosses the pendant down a trash chute
Back in the den Yuri punches a calculator as he continues his
phone
call
YURI (VO)
But the only problem with an honest buck is
theyre so hard to make The margins are
too low Too many people are doing it
Finally we are privy to the conversation
YURI
(into phone)
--Impossible Two and a quarter I cant
make a profit at two and a quarter Why
dont you take my oil and Ill fucking pay
you
Yuri hangs up stares down from his apartment window
Valentines panel truck drives away
LATER
Night has fallen over Central Park - criss-crossed by a necklace
of

lights Yuri continues to stare out of the window

He is perplexed by the sight of a diplomatic motorcade parked in
front of

his building

Before he can make sense of it the house phone rings

AVA enters

Yuri the President of Liberia is in the
lobby
Yuri stunned for a millisecond recovers with a smile

ANDRE BAPTISTE

YURI
(pulling him out of earshot of the
curious Doorman anxious whisper)
So at the same time you thought youd drop
in on your arms dealer

ANDRE BAPTISTE
Is that what you still are Youre a hard
man to get hold of all of a sudden

YURI
ANDRE BAPTISTE
--But now you mention it we are doing a
little shopping while were here - that is
if you open for business

YURI
(anxious look past Andre to the motorcade
on the street)
Theyve got to be watching

ANDRE BAPTISTE
(disdainful shrug)
Of course they blame me They always blame
me They are on a--

YURI
(unable to resist)
--hunt for a witch

ANDRE BAPTISTE

(a smile for once correcting

Yuri)
Witch-hunt But I have been granted
diplomatic immunity due to the escalation
in hostilities

(conspiratorial)
That is why I need you They are making
life difficult to re-supply It will
require a man of your unusual ingenuity

YURI
cant help you Im sorry

ANDRE BAPTISTE
(nods)

He shakes Yuris hand firmly

difficulties compel us to be unusually
generous

Yuri realizes that Andre has placed a huge uncut diamond in his
hand

A thought occurs to Yuri

YURI
You trust me right

Yuris turn to interrogate her eyes Ava smiles

would later describe as a catalogue of
carnage
90 The lock opens
AVA
(whisper to herself)

Not that Not that Yuri

Ava opens the storage room door - at first struck by the

exhibition

of her paintings inside the locker Shaking the image from her
head she turns her attention to the briefcases and other

documents

She shuffles through the passports in horror - different photos
Yuri different names George Eagleman Georges DAigle etc

INT THE CRIMEAN RESTAURANT - DAY

VITALY is back at work in the kitchen of the family restaurant
YURI approaches - Vitaly senses something amiss

VITALY
Come to see how the other half lives

YURI
I miss your borscht Mom and Dad say youre
clean

VITALY

You too They said you went legitimate -
hard to believe

YURI
Thats because its not true

Vitaly is hardly surprised

Yuri glances to his parents ANATOLY and IRINA at the restaurant
counter folding napkins - observing their two sons

They avert their eyes
YURI

Only you know Im leaving tonight - on a
job I want you to come

The notion touches Vitaly Yuri closes the deal

YURI (cantd)
Brothers in arms

Vitaly looks to his PARENTS They stare at him until he averts
his
eyes

Vitaly cant refuse his brother

EXT HIGHWAY - SIERRA LEONE DAY
A fork in the road Two large trucks slog through the bush -
take the left fork

Sierra Leone -

YURI VITALY and ANDRE JNR are in the cab of the truck beside
the
DRIVER
Andre is admiring his new M60 machine gun with attachable grenade
launcher - the gun of Rambo
YURI
(concerned by the route)
Where are we going
ANDRE JNR
RUF - freedom fighters
Yuri stares out of the window
YURI (VO)
Every faction in Africa calls themselves by
these noble names - liberation-this
patriotic-that democratic-republic-of-
something or other I guess they cant own
up to what they usually are - federation-
of-worse-oppressors-than-the last-bunch-of-
oppressors Often the most barbaric
atrocities occur when both combatants
proclaim themselves freedom fighters
The truck passes a checkpoint marked by two skulls
EXT REFUGEE CAMP - SIERRA LEONE DAY
A tent city A Jeep packed with young machete-wielding FREEDOM
FIGHTERS circles the refugee camp taunting and terrorizing the
inhabitants
The mostly WOMEN and CHILDREN are trapped by the circling Jeep
Whenever a refugee attempts to escape they are driven back by
the
increasingly manic shrieking rebels
Yuris two trucks are parked on the roadway above the camp where
the rest
of the REBELS are massed - a rag-tag mob wearing over-sized
sneakers

carrying machetes and the occasional AK-47
At a small folding table a REBEL LEADER negotiates with YURI and
ANDRE JNR The Leader places a pile of uncut diamonds on the

table

Jeep

VITALY is more interested in the camp - observing the circling
full of Rebels and their smirking comrades on the highway

From a distance he spies a WOMAN and YOUNG SON make a desperate

bid
for escape from the camp Two REBELS on foot give chase The
woman appears to be pregnant
Vitaly watches in horror The Woman is quickly overtaken and
hacked

to death Then the Boy Vitaly cant look turns away

VITALY
Jesus

Vitaly comes to a horrific realization
He hurries to Yuri still negotiating with the Rebel Leader

VITALY
Yuri I need to talk to you

YURI
Not now
VITALY
(insistent)
Now
YURI

(to the Rebel Leader)
Excuse me

Vitaly draws Yuri out of earshot

YURI
(irritated by the interruption)
What

VITALY
(anxious whisper)
We cant do this deal

YURI
(incredulous)
The fuck we cant
VITALY
(referring to the camp)
Look over there As soon as we leave
theyre going to die

YURI
(averting his eyes from the camp)
Its not our business

VITALY
(protesting)
They killed a boy just now - as young as
Nicki

Yuri flinches

The suspicious Rebel Leader and Andre Jnr approach the two
brothers

REBEL LEADER
Whats the hold up

YURI
(trying to keep his poise)
There is no hold up Ill be right there

Yuri draws Vitaly further away

YURI (contd)
Vitaly its what we always know - we cant
control what they do

VITALY
Today we can Theyre right there - close
enough to touch

YURI
(angry impatient)
What do you think theyll do if we back out
- theyll kill us

VITALY
And if we go ahead - theyll kill them

The Rebel Leader approaches again - this time hes not leaving

REBEL LEADER
What is he saying

YURI
Nothing
Vitaly realizes the futility of the discussion backs down

VITALY

(resigned)
Nothing Youre right Yuri Youre right

(getting his head back in the

game)
Did I hear you say 300 IPGs 500 assault
rifles and 800 grenades I thought it was
1200 grenades Id better check

Yuri pats his brother on the back returns to the negotiating
table

Vitaly heads for the trucks

For once we follow Vitaly Andre Jnr regards Vitaly warily

INT TRUCK DAY

The prongs of a hammer on a box of grenades ITALY is prying
open
the lid

Andre Jnr appears behind him - M60 poised ominously on his hip

ANDRE JNR
What are you doing

VITALY
Something for Yuri

ANDRE JNR
Step away - slowly

Vitaly closes the lid - a ruse He picks up the hammer and in

one

sudden violent motion swings it across Andres face smashing
his

jaw teeth flying Andres body flopping like a rag doll

Vitaly grabs two grenades from the box pulls the pin from one
and

bowls it into the truck

He runs

The truck explodes in a fireball - instantly incinerating Andre
Jnr

Yuris head whips around The Rebel Leaders head whips around
YURI
vit

Vitaly dashes for the second truck
The REBEL LEADER opens fire raking Vitaly with machine-gun fire
still trying to run with legs torn to shreds

YURI (contd)
No

A second hail of gunfire - all REBELS firing Vitalys legs

betray

the

He

the

the

him He collapses to the ground in a pile of blood and dust

We focus on Vitalys still FACE - he has taken enough bullets to
kill him three times over But he is not quite dead

Agonizingly slow he raises the grenade hand to his mouth - pulls
the pin with his teeth

CLOSE on Vitalys HAND trying to summon the strength to throw
grenade

A hand appears grasps Vitalys hand - gently but firmly removing
the grenade

YURI

The Rebels keep their guns trained on Yuri unsure where his
loyalties lie Yuri holds the fate of the camp in his hands - he
could still toss the grenade destroy the second truck sacrifice
his life

Yuri stares to his brother and then to the grenade in his hand

reaches down and delicately takes the pin from between Vitalys
lips

The eyes of the brothers meet for the last time Yuri inserts

pin into the grenade disarming it - the life goes from Vitalys
eyes forever

Yuri removes any last doubt by tossing the disarmed grenade to
Rebel Leader

Yuri walks away from Vitalys dead body and returns to the
negotiating table - Yuri now the living dead The Rebel Leader
looks to the two trucks - one burning one not He removes half
of
the diamonds from the table

EXT TRUCK DAY

YURI sits in the cab staring out of the window as the truck
drives
away

YURI (VO)
Vitaly broke the cardinal rule of
gunrunning Never pick up a gun and join
the customers

The truck turns the bend In the background true to Vitalys
prediction the rebels descend on the tent village firing
indiscriminately with their new weapons

Yuri hears the sound - we detect a barely perceptible flinch

INT REAR OF TRUCK DAY

A lone gun crate emptied of its contents has been put to use as
VITALYs makeshift coffin

YURI (VO)
Coffins are hard to come by in Sierra Leone
Demand is so high Fortunately we had a lot
of boxes just the right size

EXT SIERRA LEONE MARKET DAY

Americas Funniest Home Videos plays on a TV set The canned
laughter appears to be almost directed at YURI who is making a

long-
distance call on a geriatric telephone
We arent privy to the conversation
YURI (VO)
I dont know which is worse Jewish guilt or
Catholic guilt My parents were like Gods
tag-team
We pull back to reveal the makeshift coffin sitting at Yuris
feet

YURI (VO)
But I could not deny them the chance to say
goodbye to their eldest son
INT JFK AIRPORT - CUSTOMS BAY DAY

CLOSE ON the screen of an X-RAY machine Innocuous oversize
cargo

passes in front of the screen - a surfboard a double bass then

the
crate containing VITALYs body

YURI (VO)
For twenty Monrovian dollars a doctor removed the
lead from Vitalys body and wrote a bogus death
certificate I should have paid more

The OPERATOR of the machine stops the conveyor belt

YURI (VO)
Ive smuggled millions of rounds of
ammunition and the bullet that lands me in
jail is found under my dead brothers rib

In Vitalys chest a bullet
INT JFK AIRPORT - CONVEYOR BELT DAY

The other oversize items move down the conveyor belt for

No other items are appearing - finally the coffin containing
VITALY

Two ATF AGENTS appear behind Yuri

AGENT
(flashing some ID)
Yuri Orlov were with the Bureau of
Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms

YURI
(resigned smile regarding the
insignia on their jackets)
Believe it or not I only use the first two

The agents are not amused - handcuff Yuri
AGENT
You have the right to remain silent Use
it
They march him away

INT NEW YORK APARTMENT DAY
A phone rings

AVA out in the hallway surrounded by suitcases looks to the

She hustles NICOLAI out of the door closes it behind her The
phone continues to ring

INT MANHATTAN CENTRAL JAIL DAY

YURI on a payphone in the jailhouse corridor reluctantly hangs
up He makes another call

Papa

Anatoly looks at the telephone receiver in his hand - without
another word he passes the phone to IRINA ANATOLY walks away

IRINA
(into phone)
Both my sons are dead

INT INTERVIEW ROOM DAY

CLOSE ON a SLUG in an evidence bag tossed onto a table - by
VALENTINE The
Agent can scarcely contain his excitement

YURI sits at the small table stares at the slug

VALENTINE
One of yours

Yuri doesnt take the bait

Two other AGENTS sit at the back of the room observe the
interrogation

VALENTINE (contd)
(referring to a document)
Curiously the death certificate says he
died of heart failure
YURI
(shrug)
Maybe he did
(referring to the slug)
If I saw one of those coming at me 1d have
heart failure

The flippant comment gets under Valentines skin but he keeps his
temper in check

VALENTINE

We performed the autopsy and released your
brothers body to your family You tried
to do something decent Yuri You went
against your nature And now its cost you

(unable to resist)
Your brothers funeral is looking a lot like
your funeral

YURI
Falsifying a death certificate Thats not
going to hold me

VALENTINE
Youre right as usual

Yuri not so cocky now - waits to see where this is going

VALENTINE (contd)
(putting a copy of the New York
Times in front of Yuri)
Have you seen todays paper

A front photograph of VALENTINE posing beside Yuris documents
including

his five BRIEFCASES The headline reads MERCHANT OF DEATH IN
CUSTODY

Caption - Catalogue of carnage

VALENTINE (contd)

(pacing lauding it over Yuri)
Fake end-user certificates cut-out
companies all meticulously catalogued
Theres hardly a dictator warlord or despot
anywhere in the world you arent on first
name terms with

(producing another evidence bag

containing Avas diamond earrings

and an engagement ring)
Your trophy wife gave us the prize She
also provided us with these - which we
suspect are conflict diamonds
Yuri takes all this in

VALENTINE (contd)
She has agreed to testify against you

Yuri nods - picks up the newspaper But instead of reading about

his own front page news he opens the paper turns to World
Affairs

- various items on the warzones at the end of the millennium

Yuri reads takes his time Valentine cannot believe his
audacity

Finally Yuri reacts A broad smile - his killer smile

YURI
Enjoy it
VALENTINE
(confused)
What
YURI

This Tell me that I am everything you
despise that I am the personification of
evil that Im responsible for the breakdown
of the social fabric of society and world
order that I am a one man genocide Say
everything you want to say to me now -
because you dont have long

Valentine is infuriated by Yuris casual demeanor

VALENTINE
Are you not paying attention or are you
delusional Youve broken every arms
embargo written Theres enough in those
briefcases to buy you consecutive life
sentences Youll spend ten years going
from a cell to a courtroom before you even
start doing your time

Yuri is looking away apparently completely unconcerned His
attitude further angers Valentine

VALENTINE (contd)
You dont seem to fully appreciate the
seriousness of your situation

YURI
(snapping back - his emotion
finally showing)
My family has disowned me My wife and son
have left me My brother is dead Trust
me I fully appreciate the seriousness of my
situation But I promise you I wont spend
a single second in a courtroom

Valentine laughs derisively

VALENTINE
You are delusional

Yuri is still unfazed He leans forward to close the deal

YURI
I like you Jack Well maybe not But I
understand you You feel your loyalty to
your badge has finally been rewarded But
you havent counted on the people who gave
you that badge

Valentines turn to hesitate

YURI (contd)
(meeting Valentines gaze)
Let me tell you whats going to happen so
you can prepare yourself

Yuri nods to the interview room door
YURI (contd)

Soon theres going to be a knock on that
door and youre going to be called outside

A montage of scenes - Yuris prediction plays out accompanied by
his
commentary
INT INTERVIEW ROOM DAY
A knock at the door and an AGENT nods to VALENTINE
YURI (0C)
In the hall there will be a man who
outranks you
INT HALLWAY - JAIL DAY
Sure enough a decorated military OFFICER talks to VALENTINE in
the

hallway as Yuri describes
YURI (0C)
First he will compliment you on the fine
job youve done how youre making the world
a safer place and then he is going to tell
you that I am to be released

We observe valentines reaction - vigorously arguing with his
superior

YURI (0C)
You are going to protest you will probably
threaten to resign

The Officer still turned away from us tries to calm Valentine
INT HALLWAY - JAIL DAY
The door to the interview room opens

YURI (0C)
But in the end I will be released

Yuri exits the cell to freedom
We return to the present

INT INTERVIEW ROOM DAY
VALENTINEs eyes burn into YURI

YURI

(glancing to the open newspaper)
The reason Ill be released is the same
reason you think I will be convicted I do
rub shoulders with the most vile sadistic
men calling themselves leaders today

(referring to the newspaper)
But some of those men are the enemies of
your enemies

Valentine is starting to get a sick feeling

YURI (contd)
And while the biggest arms dealer in the world
is your boss the President of the United
States - who ships more merchandise in a day
than I do in a year - sometimes its
embarrassing to have his fingerprints on the
guns Sometimes he needs a freelancer like me
to supply opposition forces he cant be seen
supplying You call me evil but
unfortunately for you I am a necessary evil
desk

There is a long silence Then
A KNOCK AT THE DOOR

Valentine and Yuri exchange a look Valentine rises from the

VALENTINE
I would tell you to go to hell But I think
youre already there

Valentine turns on his heel He is at the door when Yuri finally
replies

YURI
What if Im not What if I sleep fine at
night What if I sleep better than you I
think thats what truly scares you

Valentine doesnt look back exits Sure enough the Officer is
â€œ the hall as Yuri predicted - COLONEL SOUTHERN

EXT MANHATTAN JAIL - REAR EXIT DAY

YURI rides alone with the briefcase on his lap

YURI (VO)

EXT MANHATTAN DAY
The nondescript sedan melts into rush-hour traffic
EXT SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE EAST - DESERT CHECKPOINT DAY
A checkpoint in the desert - the fence a literal line in the

The Border Officer inspects the crates in a truck reads the
manifest marked UMBRELLAS - QTY 4040 units

BORDER OFFICER
(skeptical)

Umbrellas - to Saudi Arabia

YURI
Sun umbrellas

Yuri hands the Officer a plain brown paper bag The Officer

looks inside

He

BORDER OFFICER

The Officer waves the convoy through
EXT DESERT - BATTLEFIELD DAY
The desert where we first found YURI the aftermath of a battle
speaks directly to camera once again
YURI
For someone whos never fired a gun or been
in a battle I have suffered many
casualties in my life I guess thats how I
survived I never went to war

His thought is interrupted by a burst of gunfire

YURI (contd)
especially with myself

Yuri walks away through the charred munitions and black smoke
In the distance the sound of sporadic gunfire
FADE TO BLACK
