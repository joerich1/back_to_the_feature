FBI DIRECTOR WOMACK
What was this book Hummel wrote on Vietnam
Anybody read it

RAYDEN SINCLAIR

GENERAL KRAMER
The skinny Mr Sinclair is that the US should have
either won the war or gotten the hell out of Vietnam and
stopped wasting
American lives I happen to share General Hummells view

I had led over two hundred incursions into China and
personally killed

that many of the enemy General put some duct tape over

Sinclair walks to the far corner of the room with the phone speaking

Company account to an account I designate From these

that

Youll be particularly interested Its a slush fund where
the

GENERAL KRAMER
Frank Jesus this is classified information

WOMACK

Is this true

General Kramer embarrassed nods yes

HUMMEL
If you want the money back youll have to tell the

General and the boys down at Justice where it came from
Good luck

Alert the media I launch the gas Refuse payment I
launch the gas

It is just after midnight You have 36 hours - all of
today and half

of tomorrow until 12 noon - to transfer the money Dont
even consider

the standard counter measure General

GENERAL KRAMER
Whats the potential casualty rate of a single rocket
armed with VX General Peterson

GENERAL PETERSON
In a dense urban area sixty seventy

RAYDEN SINCLAIR
Well thats not so bad

I GENERAL PETERSON
Thousand Seventy thousand Dead one teaspoon will
kill all living organisms in a three story office building

Get the
point
FBI DIRECTOR WOMACK
What did Hummel mean by standard countermeasure
General
GENERAL PETERSON
Napalm Standard pgison gas can be neutralized by napalm
It burns it up -- consumes it upon detonation The problem
is

that VX gas is ten times more toxic and designed to
withstand napalm
Hummel must know about Willy Peter General

GENERAL KRAMER
Course he does
(explaining to others)
Willy Peter short for White Phosphorous Incendiary
Device still
in its test phase It detonates at 6000 degrees enough
to burn up VX
(dawning on him)
That explains Hummells time frame He knows were not
operational What would it take General

GENERAL PETERSON
To equip a flight of F-16s with Willy Peter in 36
hours An act of God
(off Kramers look)
All right we can try But
view the use of Willy Peter as a secondary initiative
GENERAL KRAMER
Then on to our primary initiative (hits intercom button)
Send in SEAL Team Leader Anderson (to FBI Womack)
Whos your
best chemical biological man
