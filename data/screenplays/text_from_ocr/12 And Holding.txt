No Anosmia is when a person
looses their sense of smell Its
not uncommon in patients who suffer
serious head injuries
Unfortunately its also affecting
his ability to taste Again not
uncommon

PATRICK
Is it permanent

DOCTOR
Depends on the patient

GRACE
What do we do He cant eat

DOCTOR
He can eat He just cant taste
what hes eating

PATRICK
What she means is he wont eat

DOCTOR
Leonards association with food is
no longer about taste Its about
texture While we may be partial
to sweet or salty foods Leonard
will become partial to crunchy or
smooth ones Once he settles on a
texture he likes his appetite will
increase

GRACE
I cant believe this is happening

DOCTOR
Considering what Leonard could have
suffered hes lucky Besides he
is severely overweight A loss of
appetite may be a benefit
Grace and Patrick shoot him a look of death

can begin the healing process
