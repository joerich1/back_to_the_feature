The mind of man is capable of anything

-Joseph Conrad Heart of Darkness

OVER BLACK WE HEAR--

The rush of a shower head sputtering out water A MOAN of
pain Then a deep breath

TAREN (VO)
Close your eyes Picture your very
worst memory I bet you can’t even
remember what you were wearing
right But there’s that feeling
That sense of dreadit chokes
you Tightens your lungs until you
think youll collapse

INT BATHROOM - DAY

The rusty shape of the shower head comes into focus Water
slowly slides down the tiles to circle the drain Long
strands of dark hair sink down into the cracks

TAREN (VO)
Now open your eyes The memory
fades but the dread lingers It
gnaws at you The mind is funny
that way It won’t let you
remember But it wouldn’t dare let
you forget

The water bubbles around the drain and becomes a MURKY
REDDISH COLOR

CUT TO BLACK

The running water of the shower CUTS OFF A SOB Then--

INT TAREN’S APARTMENT - DAY

The hazy yellow light of early morning filters through the
bright blue curtains of a sparsely decorated apartment Each
piece of furniture looks as if it were nonchalantly plucked
straight from an IKEA catalogue

Reflecting in the sunlight are differently colored POST-IT
NOTES that label everything in the room-- “books here
scissors in here etc”

The chatter of the TV blares loudly throughout the room

On the counter top a GUN and BADGE rest next to a neatly
stacked pile of unopened bills and receipts

TAREN SAINT stands behind this counter calmly drinking
a glass of milk

NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV)
Members of the Lower East Side
community are desperately crying
for help as one of their own has
reportedly gone missing

Taren abruptly stops sipping on her milk and stares with
hollow eyes at the picture of a happy young woman KAYLA
DAVIS that flashes in the corner of the TV screen

NEWS ANCHOR (CONTD)
Authorities were notified Monday
afternoon after 34 year old teacher
Kayla Davis did not show up to
teach her third grade class at
PS41 Her sister who joins me
here last saw Kayla on Friday
night

The anchor hands SHAILENE DAVIS a once-radiant young
woman with desperate eyes the microphone

SHAILENE
I haven’t seen or heard from my
sister in over three days Please
if you know anything anything at
all call in I just want to know
that Kayla is safe Please

Taren is transfixed on the girl In the background there’s
the smallest glimpse of a BLOODY BUNDLE OF CLOTHES wrapped in
an OPAQUE TRASH BAG resting on the counter next to the sink

The news segment ends and Taren robotically switches off the
television With a snap of her neck like she forgot
something important she stares at the clock on the wall

INT POLICE PRECINT - DAY

In the bullpen phones RING incessantly as officers
frantically rush around

Numb to the chaos Taren walks slowly down the hall and as
OFFICERS pass her by they give her a double-take

Finally she reaches a cluster of CUBICLES in the corner of
the precinct She nears her desk and unbundles her coat In
the adjacent cublices Detectives CAMDEN (30s) and MAHONEY
(40s) stop mid-conversation to look over to her
AT HER DESK

Taren leafs through the assorted folders Her fingers stop
shuffling as she looks at one file in particular

There’s a picture of a MAN paper clipped to his MEDICAL
RECORDS One word stands out amongst them DECEASED

MAHONEY
Hey rookie let me introduce you to
a legend round here “The Machine”

Taren looks up from the file catching the tail end of
Mahoney’s words

MAHONEY (CONTD)
Make anyone cry while you were gone
Taren Ask your the FedEx guy
uncomfortable questions like your
witnesses

Taren turns in her chair her face revealing no frustration

TAREN
Depends did you make any arrests
Mahoney

A slow smile spreads over Mahoney’s face as his jaw works

MAHONEY
You know I’ve been a little
distracted with IID pressing me for
anecdotes about your behavior Had
to really dig deep to think about
all the fun times we’ve had

TAREN

You don’t like how I work That’s
fine But I hope you know anything
that you say about me comes back
around to everyone here And I
don’t know how anyone’s going to
feel when IID’s got the arrest
records in their hands and my
name’s the only one that shows up

Wordless Mahoney grabs his coffee and exits the cubicle
leaving Camden staring awkwardly at Taren

CAMDEN
Should’ve seen the welcome he had
for me Made me fix him that coffee
while he pointed at things around
the office

(MORE)
CAMDEN (CONTD)
(thinking)
I shouldve spit in it

TAREN
Welcome to the Land of Embittered
Males with a False Sense of
Entitlement

Camden smiles and sticks out his hand-- the two shake

CAMDEN
I’m Detective Camden Just
transferred over from Connecticut

VOICE (0S)
Detective Saint

The booming voice tears her attention toward CHIEF DAVID
JACKSON a sharp-witted man armed with a cold demeanor
as he walks by He’s bundled in a large jacket snow falling
off his shoulders and glares toward Taren

JACKSON
IID’s already here I want you in
the interrogation room in ten Not
a minute later

TAREN
Yes sir

Jackson continues on leaving Taren without another word
Taren stares after him a frown forming on her face

CAMDEN
Hey-- don’t be nervous IID’s
always trying to make something out
of nothing I think they get bored
over there

Her head whips around to Camden

TAREN
Why the fuck would I be nervous

She pushes away from her chair and follows after the Chief

INT INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

Visibly on edge Taren and Jackson sit across from a LAWYER
and a member from the Internal Investigations Division (IID)
staring at group of PHOTOS splayed across the table
IID
Now we’ve gathered thirteen
witness testimonies the incident
report and the coroner’s final
notes

He spreads out a group of PHOTOS across the table They
depict a DECEASED MAN with a bullet hole across his shoulder

IID (CONTD)
Wed like you to walk us through
the incident Ms Saint step-by-
step to corroborate

JACKSON
And what She forgets the color of
the sky and you take her badge You
shut us down

LAWYER
The department could potentially be
held liable if the testimony isn’t
in tact

JACKSON
And while you dot your i’s and
cross your t’s someone’s getting
murderedwaitsomeone else just
got shot-

IID
-A person is dead Chief Jackson I
need to make sure I don’t let
someone walk away if they’ve got on
their hands

TAREN
I’1l tell you anything you want to
know Anything

IID pushes a photo closer to Taren

IID
Why don’t you start with the events
that led up to the shooting

TAREN
Of course

A beat Taren stares ahead blinking rapidly To the casual
eye it’s almost unnoticeable The room becomes OUT OF FOCUS
like rain on a windshield as Taren tries to recall a
memory
TO

FLASH

A Iman
file
of it

with a gun the same one from the picture in Taren’s
he’s wearing a bright blue shirt the sun glaring off
and then nothing but DARKNESS---

IID
Ms Saint The shooting

WE’RE

again

BACK as her head snaps up and all in the room is clear

TAREN
I was off duty and was on my way
home At eleven hundred hours all
available units were called to a
scene where a robbery was in
progress At this point the
suspect male had already engaged
officers in fire I exited my
vehicle and proceeded to the hood
of the car From this angle I was
able to get a clear shot of the
suspect I took the shot that was
most readily available as per my
training dictates

IID
Which was

JACKSON
This is fucking ridiculous--

IID
Ms Saint

TAREN
I aimed at the suspect’s right
shoulder Training dictates that
you take the shot most readily
available

At this the Lawyer who had been scribbling notes on a legal
pad quips up

LAWYER
And if it was his shoulder Ms
Saint then how was it that the
suspect died so suddenly The
medical examiner reported an
extremely rapid amount of blood
loss
TAREN
He was distracted by something--
most likely a sound or a reflection-
- it turned his attention toward me
as I fired my weapon and the bullet
went through his heart He turned

Silence hangs in the air as Taren’s matter-of-fact account
ends The Lawyer cuts the silence as he clears his throat

TAREN (CONTD)
Can I just say one more thing

IID
The testimony was enough--

TAREN
John Farkas hadn’t been paying
child support for a year an a half
He’d been in an out of jail for the
past five years We can sit and
talk about how much of a tragedy
this was but let’s be honest he
was a criminal

JACKSON
Taren--—

TAREN
This is my job I want to know
where you draw the line

JACKSON
Are we done here Do you have what
you need

The investigator and lawyer eye each other for a brief moment
and then nod reaching the same consensus

IID
Yes Chief we’re done Ms Saint’s
testimony was in line with the
evidence and testimony we’ve
gathered She did in fact do what
protocol dictated Barring some
paperwork of course we’ll be
clearing you for duty

The IID reaches across the table and shakes Taren’s hand
IID (CONTD)

Thank you for your cooperation
Detective

Taren releases his hand letting it fall away limply through
the air

INT POLICE PRECINT - HALLWAY - DAY

Jackson and Taren exit the interrogation room He grips her
forearm hard like a child needing scolding and pulls her
aside as the lawyer and IID walk down the hall away from
them

JACKSON
Are you good

TAREN
Chief

JACKSON

Are you good Are you feeling all
right Are you sick Or dying Or
maybe a relative is Because that’s
the only reason I can think of to
explain how you could be so
careless

TAREN
I’m fine

JACKSON
Good Then you need to get it
together Taren Seriously
botching a routine shooting

TAREN
I know--

JACKSON
--I need you out there Got it
I’ve had two closed cases in the
last few weeks Two

TAREN
I did what I supposed to do in
there What more do you want from
me

JACKSON
Do you know what they’re going to
do when they get back Do you

She shakes her head angry and reluctant to answer
JACKSON (CONT’D)
They’re going to sit on their asses
with that paperwork and wait for
you to trip again so they can gut
you before they’ve got a lawsuit on
their hands They’1l sooner feed
you to the sharks then admit they
were wrong

TAREN
I won’t give them that chance Just
let me prove it

In midst of their fight a young DESK SERGEANT strides toward
Jackson and Taren fast and out of breath

DESK SERGEANT
Hey Chief You’re gonna want to get
some suits out to the Lower East
Side fast We’ve got a body

Taren gives Jackson a sidelong glance

TAREN
If I don’t go back now I’1l1 never
get back in it

The Desk Sergeant quizzically looks between Taren and Jackson
as the Chief debates

JACKSON
I can’t have you pulling rookie-
training-school-shit like that
again Understood

TAREN
Yes sir

JACKSON
(To the Desk Sergeant)
Round up Camden tell him he and
Taren are on it
(Sardonically to Taren)
Welcome back

INT SQUARD CAR - DAY

Taren leans her forehead against the window watching the
gray snow littered city pass by Silence hangs between them
Camden nervously fiddles with the radio
CAMDEN
Oh sorry do you want this on or
off

TAREN

Either way is fine

CAMDEN
Thank God Chief’s been sticking me
with newbies since Spring to teach
them the ropes Last trainee was so
jittery I could barely talk in the
car let alone play music

A beat Camden waits for her to react but Taren says
nothing

CAMDEN (CONTD)
Your old partner was Gomez wasn’t
he

Again she doesn’t answer Instead she begins to draw a
circle into the frosted glass

CAMDEN (CONT’D)
Taren

TAREN
YeahHe switched during the whole
IID thing

CAMDEN
Prick Let me guess-- he’d drive
the car but you’d make all the
arrests

She draws in two eyes and a frown line into the circle

TAREN
Something like that

CAMDEN
You don’t have to pretend Everyone
knows how many closed cases you’ve
got It’s impressive really

TAREN
It’s my job

CAMDEN
But it’s more than that isn’t it
Most guys can tuck themselves into
bed at night comfortably knowing
that they “tried” They can go home
and kiss their wives and fall
asleep without any trouble because
they “tried” today But youyou
can’t sit still until you see
things through

She brutally smudges out the face and turns toward Camden

Silence ensues after her mini-speech Taren takes a deep

breath in

TAREN
The world only has so much room for
all that bad shit If all that
stuff is left out there to fester
wed rot Somebody has to put the
bad people away

TAREN (CONTD)
Sorry I’m just

CAMDEN
No I get it If I’m being honest
I’m glad we’re partnered up

Taren flashes him a skeptical look

CAMDEN (CONTD)
No I mean it I remember back when
you first started You must’ve been
what-- 25

TAREN
24 actually

CAMDEN
You kept your head down made your
arrests It’s like you eat sleep
and breathe this

TAREN
Is that so terrible

CAMDEN
No it’s refreshing I’ve been at
this for Jesus eleven years now
When I started I was like you
Diligent and all that

(MORE )

CAMDEN (CONTD)
But then something happens and your
wheels stop turning You suddenly
start eating out of the same lazy
trough as the rest of them

TAREN
What happens
CAMDEN
Hmm
TAREN
To make you stop caring What is
it
CAMDEN

Fear It becomes real to you

Taren opens her mouth to respond maybe even to refute but
her cellphone BUZZES loudly She scrambles to pull it from

her pocket Camden glances over at the phone number on the

screen

CAMDEN (CONTD)
816 Who do you know in Missouri

Taren scowls as she shuts down her phone cutting off the
incessant buzzing for good

TAREN
No one Must be a wrong number

EXT LOWER EAST SIDE - DAY

Camden and Taren exit the squad car to a road laden with
snow Paces away bright police tape blocks off the haunting
crime

As Camden and Taren approach OFFICER DANHOE (male late
20s) a uniformed PO appears

CAMDEN
You the first responder

DANHOE
Yeah Officer Danhoe You are

Both flash their badges
CAMDEN

Detective Camden and Detective
Saint What’ve we got

Danhoe lifts the tape and he and Camden step inside the crime
scene Taren’s attention drifts toward THREE CHILDREN who
meticulously work to build a snowman near the adjacent
sidewalk

DANHOE
Neighbor called it in when they
went to go shovel the sidewalk
Said she didn’t see anybody else on
the street at the time

Camden and Danhoe stop short as they finally stand in front
of the body

Camden crouches down next to the body to get a better look

CAMDEN
You get an ME

DANHOE
Dawson from county is making his
way over

AT THE SIDEWALK

Taren walks toward a WOMAN the witness sitting on the steps
near the children She wears an oversized puffer jacket but
her legs are bare

TAREN
Good morning ma’am my name is
Detective Saint

The woman laughs takes a drag from her cigarette

WOMAN
Well isn’t that ironic

TAREN
Your name is

WOMAN
Elizabeth Elizabeth Holmes

TAREN
How long have you been living here
Ms Holmes

WOMAN
Three four years almost

TAREN
And it’s just you as the guardian
in your household

ELIZABETH (WOMAN)
(eyes narrowing)
If you’re asking if I’m a single
mother the answer is yes I do
what I can to raise them right
butbut sometimes things fold
under you

TAREN
You were the first on the scene
correct

ELIZABETH

I guess so Woke up early to check
the school closings And I wanted
to get the snow off the sidewalk in
case more came and it got too
heavy

TAREN
Was anyone with you

ELIZABETH
Mikey The oldest I got him up to
help

TAREN
And you saw nothing Nobody was out
here

ELIZABETH

No The snow was still fresh
That’s how I saw it There was a
lump in the snow kind of looked
like a camel’s hump But worse
Mikey wanted to touch it You know
how kids are They don’t know
enough to be terrified of things

Taren and Elizabeth now focus on the three children as they
fight over who gets to adorn the snowman with the carrot
nose

In their struggle they accidentally knock the FIGURE’S HEAD
to the ground The head hits the sidewalk with an unsettling
thud and the snow dissipates back from whence it came

CAMDEN (0S)
Hey Taren

At Camden’s call Taren turns back to Elizabeth and gives her
a tight smile

TAREN
Thank you for your help Ms Holmes
We may reach out again if we need
any further information In the
meantime why don’t you gather your
boys and take them inside

Elizabeth stubs out her cigarette and gathers her coat
tighter

ELIZABETH

Trust me-- living in this city
That’s not the worst they’ve seen

This visibly upsets Taren

TAREN
It’s a dead body Ms Holmes
Please

Elizabeth shrugs and stands

ELIZABETH
Fellas-- who wants hot cocoa

AT THE CRIME SCENE

Taren reenters the crime scene scowling She draws close to
Camden who now wears gloves

CAMDEN
Anything

TAREN
No

CAMDEN

Thought not Look over here

Taren follows his finger as he points to the snow below TIRE
TRACKS lead down the road

CAMDEN (CONTD)
Danhoe says he checked all the cars
on the street None of them have
been shoveled out yet These tracks
start from the edge of the block
and go further down the road

TAREN
An outside job then Was the vic a
resident

Camden flashes her the victim’s wallet The name on the front
license reads “ALLISON CLARKE”

CAMDEN
No She lives in the Village My
guess She was being followed

TAREN
Or she was meeting someone here
CAMDEN
A meeting
TAREN
Could’ve been drugs Or maybe a
date
CAMDEN

Great thought I always say every
date should end with brutal murder

TAREN
What do you mean

CAMDEN
Take a look for yourself

Taren follows a trail of blood to the body

TAREN
Lots of secondary spatter here
Definitely a quick killing Maybe a
hasty decision

Taren crouches down next to the body

TAREN (CONTD)
They used something small like a
clubor a

She trails off as she finally sees the full impact of the
woman’s injury Her neck is SLIT in a gruesome semicircle--
trailing from one ear to the other

A look of horror with a hint of recognition pass over
Taren’s face as Camden finishes her sentence

CAMDEN
A knife

Taren’s vision goes blurry like it did in the interrogation
room Time seems to slow down as her knees give out and she
begins to sink to the ground

Suddenly she’s retching into an undisturbed white patch of
snow

CAMDEN (CONTD)
Jesus not here

Taren sits back her sickness apparently passed Camden
stares wildly at her-- torn between wanting to kick her ass
and wanting to help He decides on the latter

CAMDEN (CONTD)
Are you good

That question again Taren’s eyes grow dark

TAREN
I’m good

CAMDEN
Why don’t you go sit in the car
Catch your breath while we wait for
Dawson

Taren stands up quickly shaking her head

TAREN
No no I’m good Let Danhoe wait
for the ME and forensics We need
to go canvass the area Find out if
anyone saw her

She doesn’t wait for Camden’s approval and begins to trudge
back to the squad car Camden stands still behind her face
scrunched up in confusion at Taren’s back

INT EXT SQUARD CAR - NIGHT

Camden parks the car in the near-empty precinct parking lot
The two exit looking weary and worn

CAMDEN
Unbelievable Running around the
neighborhood all day and nobody’s
seen this chick before

Taren remains silent She watches as flurries begin to start
again

Camden kicks at the old snow his wheels turning in
overdrive

CAMDEN (CONTD)
Somebody has to be lying That’s
what it always is They get a
splash of blood on their hands but
they still want to think they’re
clean

He stops mid-rant noticing Taren staring at her hands as
snowflakes melt into her palms

CAMDEN (CONTD)
Hey you all right It’s weird I
know Getting back into this stuff
after awhile Our brains aren’t
wired to deal with all this shit

She whispers almost as if she was reassuring herself

TAREN
I’m ok1I’m ok

CAMDEN
Where do you want to start next

TAREN
Let’s get some sleep I’m sure
youve got someone waiting for you

CAMDEN
Nah not me People don’t like it
much when you become the “I tried”

guy

He comes around to her side of the car but Taren takes a
step back He gives her a coy smile trying to persuade her

CAMDEN (CONTD)
We could grab some coffee and try
to run a background check Or maybe
go search her home

TAREN
Let’s take the night Clear our
heads at least

His face falls but he nods in agreement

CAMDEN
Yeah okI’1ll see you

Taren stands beside the squad car watching Camden’s every
move as he enters his own vehicle and finally vacates the
parking lot

When she is sure that he is long gone the facade cracks and
her breathing quickens until she’s near hyperventilating

She puts her head in her hands as snow melts into her hair

INT TAREN’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Taren sits curled in her bed scribbling furiously She stops
for a moment and turns back the pages The dates go JANUARY
12th JANUARY 13th JANUARY 14th JANUARY 15th-- All of the
pages are blank

Stressed Taren closes her eyes and rests her head back on
the headboard

FLASHBACK TO

EXT CENTRAL PARK - THICKET - DAY

Eyes open to see a HAND crumpled into the frosted grass
below Slowly it unclenches and its owner begins to get up
The owner’s arm is bare and badly bruised

When we finally get to her face it hits us This is Taren and
her face is covered in blood A drop of it spills onto her
arm and she takes it in stoically

Her eyes catch the glimpse of something pale off to her left
As Taren twists her body she sees laying in the grass next
to her is the dead body of KAYLA DAVIS

The corpse’s throat is slit in the same brash way as the
earlier body

Taren makes a guttural noise of distress and digs the heels
of her palms into her eyes

TAREN
NoGod

And then it hits her- she doubles over and vomits right next
to the corpse This disgusting and impossibly human act is
enough to push her over the edge as a sob rips through her
chest

Taren’s tears quiet immediately as she hears the harsh sounds
of a CELL PHONE vibrating With some hesitation she carefully
reaches into the corpse’s jacket pocket and retrieves the
phone

IT READS SHAILENE - TWO MISSED CALLS

Without a second thought Taren scrambles to her feet and
hastily turns the phone off She then puts her hands to her
head

TAREN (CONTD)
Fuck

Through the dense trees Taren can see another pair of
joggers They haven’t found her Not yet at least

She looks back down at the body nodding slowly

TAREN (CONTD)
Ok

Bypassing delicacy Taren crouches down and begins to strip
the corpse naked

She then uses the corpse’s shirt to wipe off most of the
blood With a stoic face she drags the body further into the
cover of the snow and trees She wipes it down once more and
then folds the rest of the clothes into her arms before
walking away

She joins the land of the living with no one the wiser

INT SUBWAY - DAY

Taren sits calmly on the subway with the clothes folded in
her lap A small smudge of blood is just barely visible under
the cover of her bangs

Over the scene we can hear Taren in voice over talking to
someone

VOICE (VO)
Do you oftentimes find that you’re
not able to speak your mind

TAREN (VO)
What do you mean Like censorship

VOICE (VO)

More along the lines of telling
people how you’re feeling- Do you
think you tend to keep that to
yourself

TAREN (VO)
Who am I going to tell Who really
wants to hear that shit

INT TAREN’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY

Taren enters her home and rummages under the sink pulling
out a garbage bag She immediately smashes the clothes into
it and then strips herself of her own clothes and tosses them
into the bag as well

VOICE (VO)
What makes you think that nobody
wants to hear about what’s going on
with you

Naked and shivering she runs to her bathroom

INT TAREN’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY

TAREN (VO)
Telling people all the messed up
stuff that’s going in youit’s
like staring at a car crashwhy
remind yourself of something so
ugly

She sits curled under the jet stream of the water scrubbing
hard at her body The dirt and grime circle the drain

INT TAREN’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY

Taren stands fully clothed and opens the refrigerator She
pours herself a glass of milk to calm her nerves As she sips
on it she switches the television on We’ve come full circle

as the earlier news report blares

Her neck snaps to the clock just as it did before She adorns
herself with her badge and gun and gets the garbage bag of
bloody clothes

EXT ALLEYWAY - DAY

Blocks away Taren throws the garbage bag into a large
DUMPSTER She reaches her hand inside with a lighter curled
around her fingers

She flicks on the flame and watches as the trash begins to
burn

VOICE (VO)
You think what’s going on inside of
you is ugly

She pulls out a cigarette and lights it walking away as the
dumpster melts away Sirens begin to wail

TAREN (VO)
We all are We’re disgusting Why
would anyone care for somebody when
they’re all cut up like this

INT TAREN’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY

The siren’s become the sound of an ALARM CLOCK RINGING Taren
jolts awake dissipating the dream of the earlier scene She
sits in bed for a moment cradling her head in her hands

INT PSYCHIATRISTS OFFICE

Taren sits in a large loveseat her feet curled up next to
her A young psychiatrist ZACH (30s) sits across from her in
an identical seat As he speaks we realize this is the voice
we had been hearing talking to Taren in the earlier VO

ZACH (VOICE)
Have you been feeling this negative
a lot lately

Taren takes a moment before she answers In this silence we
go to--

A QUICK JUMPCUT

Taren’s eyes linger over the dead body from earlier Noticing
things she hadn’t before-- flies circling near the head the
fingers of the corpse slowly turning blue the murky color of
the blood

WE’RE BACK and Taren whips her head around to Zach Her words
are sharp and mean

TAREN
It’s a little hard to be all bright
and shiny when everyone thinks
youre losing your mind

ZACH
You feel that way

TAREN
That’s why I’m here aren’t I IID
the Chief you-- they want me to
meet with you to make sure I still
work

ZACH
This is a routine meeting Taren
Any time something like this
happens officers are required to
have a psych evaluation

TAREN
Tell me what exactly is “something
like this”

Zach leans forward in his seat

ZACH
This is a tough job You are
experiencing things that eat away
at the psyche Nobody can blame you
for that We just want to help you
get a handle on things

Taren considers this for a moment She gets up from her chair
and moves to the window pressing her check against the cool
glass

TAREN
It makes you feel like a different
person you know The “things” I’ve
seen

ZACH
Explain that to me

She frowns not sure how to continue

ZACH (CONTD)
I’m not here to pass or fail you
Taren I just want to talk

Taren looks back at him and nods

TAREN
It all gets loud and then suddenly
it’s just this violent quiet space
and you don’t know what to do with
yourself You don’t remember who
you are

ZACH
How long have you been feeling this
disconnect Taren

TAREN
I don’t knowI thought I was
doing good It’s the winter I’m
good when it gets cold like this
(MORE)

TAREN (CONTD)
You have to remember about heating
bills and coats and gloves and shit
like that

ZACH
Explain that to me You think your
memory depends on the weather

TAREN
No I’m just saying that it’s
harder to forget things in the
cold Don’t you feel that way

ZACH
I can’t say that I do But if you
do--

TAREN

--Well just fuck it then

A beat Taren picks at her nails faking like his comment
doesn’t sting

ZACH
Tell me about your personal life
Taren What do you do when you’re
not on the clock When you’re
trying to be “yourself”

Taren gives Zach the smirk of the Devil

FLASHBACK TO

INT BAR - DAY

Clad in a skin tight black dress and her hair sweeping across
her bare shoulders Taren sits at the bar toying with the
salt rim of her margarita

TAREN (VO)
You know sometimes when you get
all dressed up you feel like you
can do anything Well for me it’s
like I’m tipping the balance

Patrons enter and exit the bar all seemingly light-years
away from Taren and her spot at the counter

TAREN (VO)
I feel like if I lie the universe
might come untetheredbut I do it
anyway

Just then a MAN (30s) sits down next to Taren and orders a
drink For a moment Taren studies him-- he’s wild hair but a
cocky half-smile Her choice has been made and she takes a
large gulp from her tumbler

Taren shifts her legs crossing them so her right foot grazes
the man’s calf He looks over at first out of politeness
but then his gaze lingers

MAN
Id offer you a drink but you seem
to be able to take care of

yourself

TAREN
What else do you have to offer
then

MAN

How about my name I’m Jason

He extends his hand Taren smiles it’s radiant and showy--
not like the somber girl we’ve seen before

TAREN
Taren Do you live around here

JASON (MAN)
Live in Brooklyn I work in
Manhattan-- I like to come here
afterwards

TAREN
Lucky for you then

JASON
My thoughts exactly

INT PSYCHATRIST’S OFFICE - DAY
Zach scribbles in his notebook

TAREN
Nobody notices it though They
think that it’s the real me

ZACH
Have you considered the possibility
that this could be the “real” you
Or at least a part of you

TAREN
I mean we’re all hiding something
aren’t we Show me any one person
that claims to know the entire
truth about someone and I’11l show
you a liar

INT BAR - NIGHT

Empty glasses are scattered in front of Taren and Jason as
they laugh over a joke

JASON
I kid you not Everyone was
staring

TAREN

Well can you blame them when the
majority of the people you work
with are women

The smile Jason’s face starts to slip

JASON
What do you mean

TAREN
You’re a teacher right

JASON
I don’t think I said that

Taren giggles obviously drunk Her buzz is driving her
words

TAREN
Sorry You’ve got chalk around the
edges of your sweater And I saw
the quizzes when you opened your
bag I just assumed

JASON
Wow that’s really perceptive What
do you do again

TAREN
I uh--

Something to Taren’s right catches her eye and she trails
off

JASON
Taren

TAREN
I’1l just be a second

Looking haunted she descends from her barstool and nearly
runs to the exit of the bar

EXT BAR - CONTINUOUS

Taren bursts through the door and out on the sidewalk
Standing in front of her is an older woman dressed in a
hospital gown and taking a drag on a cigarette This is her
mother ANNE (60s)

TAREN
What the fuck are you doing here

Anne takes the cigarette from between her teeth When she
speaks its with a slight drawl

ANNE
Sweetie come over here Give your
momma some sugar

TAREN
You stay away from me

ANNE
Don’t be like that

TAREN
I washed my hands of you

ANNE
How can you be so unloving I
birthed you Taren Raised you Gave
you everything you needed

TAREN
And I’ve kept you alive Isn’t that
enough

ANNE

No I want my daughter

TAREN
You don’t get this You don’t get
to see me

ANNE
When are you going to stop
pretending that you aren’t capable
of the things I’ve done

TAREN
I am nothing like you

ANNE
Yeah Who are you talking to
sweetie
Suddenly Taren stands alone on the sidewalk A cigarette
burns in her hand She looks at it stricken as the
realization dawns-- she had only been talking to herself

She turns back to the bar and Jason is nowhere to be seen

INT PSYCHATRIST’S OFFICE - DAY

Zach notices the shift in Taren’s demeanor He gets up and
sits on his desk nearer to her

ZACH
So the date how would you say it
went

Practiced in the art now Taren easily slaps on a smile

TAREN
It went well Happiest I’ve been in
weeks

ZACH
Yeah

TAREN

Mhm I finally feel like
everything’s under control

BACK TO PRESENT

INT POLICE PRECINT - CUBICLES - DAY

Taren approaches her desk pulling out her hat and gloves as
Camden appears

CAMDEN
I’ve been trying to reach you all
morning

TAREN

Rough night Where’d you get it

CAMDEN
I couldn’t sleep last night so I
came in early and started a small
board

He points to the WHITEBOARD on his wall that has a picture of
ALLISON CLARKE and her birth certificate Next to it is a
heading that reads TIMELINE

Underneath is a LARGE QUESTION MARK

TAREN
I see

CAMDEN
She’s clean-- nothing in our
records

A YOUNGER OFFICER pops his head in and hands over a file
across Taren to Camden

YOUNG PO
Got the casts for the tire tracks
you wanted 1992 Volvo 850

CAMDEN
Thanks kid Put out an ABP will
you

YOUNG PO
Copy

The younger officer leaves and Taren moves closer to the
board

TAREN
What about family Friends

At this Camden smiles

CAMDEN
Thought you’d never ask

He takes opens a file on his desk and holds up a picture

CAMDEN (CONTD)
Monica and David Clarke They live
on the Upper East Side He’s in
real estate

TAREN
Why didn’t you start with that
Let’s get moving

This clearly isn’t the reaction Camden had anticipated

CAMDEN
I didn’t know where you were Taren

TAREN
So

CAMDEN
So this is big shit AKA the kind
of shit you don’t try to go after
alone

They hold one another’s gaze for a long moment Taren breaks
first looking away

TAREN
Then let’s go

INT APARTMENT — DAY

Camden hands MONICA CLARKE tear-stained face and still
dressed in her pajamas a hot cup of tea DAVID CLARKE sits
stoically next to her looking shell-shocked

Taren stands paces away staring a pictures on the fireplace
mantle

MONICA
She was our only child Our baby

Taren lifts up a picture of ALLISON and MONICA wearing
matching tennis outfits

CAMDEN
Do you have any idea where was she
going that night

MONICA
She’d been gushing about some guy
she met at a bar Said they were
going on a date

Taren turns her attention toward Monica and narrows her eyes

TAREN
You let her meet up with a stranger
on her own Why didn’t you alert
anyone when you didn’t hear from
her

Monica looks like she’s been slapped

MONICA
I didn’tI didn’t know

Monica starts to break down Camden places a hand on her back
in solidarity and comfort Richard doesn’t move a muscle

Taren sets the picture facedown on the mantle and begins to
look at the others once more

TAREN
Did she tell you the name of the
bar

This time it’s Richard to speak up

RICHARD
She’s a grown woman What were we
supposed to do Watch her like a
hawk

CAMDEN
No of course not But anything she
might have told you could help

Taren picks up another picture This time its of a younger
Allison in a cap and gown sitting on the hood of a 1992
Volvo 850

Taren whips around holding the picture uncomfortably close to
Monica and Richards faces

TAREN
Is this Allison’s car

RICHARD
Y-yes

TAREN
Who got it for her How long has
she had it

Camden throws his hands up at Taren’s uncouth questions
Monica slowly lifts her head from her hands and stares at
Taren with absolute murder in her eyes

MONICA
It was her graduation present
She’s been driving it since high
school And if that’s all I think
it’s time for you all to get the
hell out of our house

Taren’s face drains of all color

INT SQUARD CAR - DAY

Taren cradles the photograph of Allison in her lap while
Camden barks into the car’s walkie talkie system

CAMDEN
All available units we’ve got a 10-
28 for the 1992 Volvo 850 The
license plate number is 813723 I
repeat license plate number is
813723 Over

He sets the walkie talkie down and looks over to Taren Opens
his mouth but the words escape him Taren notices and it
ticks her off

TAREN
What What is it

CAMDEN
It’s justyou don’t have to be so
combative Nobody’s going to fault
you if you show some compassion

TAREN
Don’t tell me how “be”

CAMDEN
I’m not I’m just saying that
people have a right to be broken
every now and then

TAREN
That doesn’t solve cases

CAMDEN
But you’re allowed to give people a
break Yourself included

TAREN
Listen let’s not do this This
isn’t group therapy

CAMDEN
Right Got it

BRIEFLY WE FLASH BACK TO

We hear no sound over this scene but we see Taren grabbing
at her mother outside the bar

BACK IN THE CAR

Taren rubs her eyes trying to dislodge the memory The
scanner crackles cutting through the silence

RADIO
Possible match to 2009 Chevy
license plate 813723 at the East
River Park 10-67

Taren picks up the walkie talkie this time

TAREN
10-4 ETA 15 minutes

She flicks on the sirens and Camden pumps the gas pedal

EXT EAST RIVER PARK - DAY

Taren and Camden arrive and exit their car approach the
officers on scene The Volvo sits parked on the side of the
road doors splayed open

TAREN (VO)
I feel wrong when I’m in the dress
and heels because it’s like my
subconscious knows that catching
killers and solving murders-- it’s
where I belong

Both rush to the car and take in the sight of yet another
DEAD BODY throat slit like the last two

TAREN (VO)
But I don’t think I realized that
even I could add to the murk

Neither detective can meet each other’s eyes Camden softly
speaks up--

CAMDEN
I think it’s a serial killer

Taren begins to walk away from the car realization dawning
on her face

TAREN
I live here I live here

INT TAREN’S APARTMENT - LATER
Dark has fallen across New York but Taren is wide awake

From her window she can see the spot of the car now vacated
She closes her shutters and dashes to the kitchen area

IN THE KITCHEN

She dumps the contents of her silverware drawer across the
counter frantically counting her knives

INT TAREN’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT

With a sudden rush of urgency Taren tears through boxes in
medicine cabinet She empties them into the sink and
dissatisfied moves her search to the cupboard below

TAREN (VO)
It’s like I put on the dress and
pretend because I don’t want to
admit that I’m just as capable of
doing the bad things that I put
people away for

ZACH (VO)
You’re allowed to make mistakes
Taren We’re not wired to be self-
correcting

She unearths several more boxes until she finally finds the
one she was looking for-- a bottle of antidepressants She
throws some back and chokes them down without any liquid aid

INT TAREN’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY

She moves to her side table and picks out the PHONE she took
from Kayla Davis’ corpse Small bits of blood are flecked
around the edges of screen

TAREN (VO)
Even ifeven if you’ve done
something horrible

Taren’s finger hovers over the power button debating and
wondering But then she snaps throwing the phone to the
floor

ZACH (VO)
Even then

She begins to manically stomp on the phone until it’s nothing
but CRUDE SHARDS of glass littering the lonely floor
INT POLICE PRECINT - JACKSON’S OFFICE - DAY

Jackson shuts the door to his office and goes to sit
his desk Across from him are Taren and Camden both
like sleep has evaded them

JACKSON
At what point were either of you
going to notify me that we were
dealing with a serial killer

CAMDEN
We had no reason to believe that
the first body--

JACKSON

--No reason Did you get a profiler
to look at those slash marks
Jesus a ten-year-old couldve seen
that kill was planned

CAMDEN
There wasn’t much to go on sir

JACKSON
Yeah well now you’ve got a
shitstorm to deal with I want you
to do a briefing as soon as you
can I’m not dealing with the IID

again
TAREN
I want off the case
CAMDEN
What
TAREN

I don’t want to be on this Give it
to someone else Another precinct
even

CAMDEN
Whoa wait-- You’re not the only one
who gets to make that decision Why
didn’t you say anything to me

TAREN
I’m telling you now

CAMDEN
This could be huge for us Hell
it’s probably the biggest thing
I’ve gotten in years

down at
looking
JACKSON
Camden--

TAREN
Really And have you stopped to ask
yourself why that is

Camden looks away from her stung

JACKSON
Camden get out

CAMDEN
Chief

JACKSON
Out Now

Camden rises and slams the door behind him

JACKSON (CONTD)
Was it me Did I put too much on
you by relying on you too much

TAREN
NoI don’t know I just don’t
think it’s the right fit for me
anymore

JACKSON
You know what I think I think
youre finally scared

TAREN
Yeah Well that’s the fucking
breaking point isn’t it

JACKSON
The IID won’t let you come back if
they find out you dropped the case
You know that don’t you Are you
willing to risk that

TAREN
(grasping at straws)

I’m not asking you to take me off
the force I just don’t want this
A serial killer The minute this
gets it out it’s going to be huge
I don’t need that kind of spotlight
on me right now

JACKSON
All those years of work
Tarenyou’ll never recover if you
quit now It’ll never get
easierYou’1l stay on the case
understood

Taren bites her lip and nods not trusting herself to speak

INT POLICE PRECINT - DAY

Taren exits Jackson’s office to find Camden leaning against
the adjacent wall waiting for her Abashed she leans on the
wall next to him prolonging meeting his eyes

CAMDEN
I’m not like you Ok I haven’t
seen the gory things you’ve seen
And I see you work and now that I
can never come close to doing what
you do

He takes a deep breath in trying to steady himself trying
to find the right words

TAREN
Look let’s just--

CAMDEN

No please Let me finish I know
you’ve got your own things and I’ve
got mine But you’ve had me flayed
on the cross since day one Taren I
know I’m not a white knight but
doing this solving this case it’s
the only way I’m going to learn

TAR
It’s just not that simple

CAMDEN
That car wasn’t hidden not even
close Whoever did this knows
were looking for them We’re in it
now

TAREN
No--

CAMDEN
We can’t stop nowit’s
likeit’s like a hunger
(MORE)

CAMDEN (CONTD)
Like when you burn your tongue and
you can’t stop yourself from
feeling all the little bumps over
and over againI have to find
this guy don’t you feel the same

Taren gives herself a sidelong glance in the reflection of
the Chief office’s windows She continues to stare as she
answers--

TAREN
Yesyes I do

INT POLICE PRECINCT - BRIEF ROOM - DAY

Camden stands at the front of the room packed with officers
leading the briefing Taren sits next to the podium taking
notes

CAMDEN
There have been two victims that we
know so of far ID’d as Allison
Clarke and Jade Hoechlin

He clicks the pointer and the screen changes Two pictures
appear-- one of Allison Clarke and the second of Jade
Hoechlin

EXT POLICE PRECINCT - GARAGE - DAY

Taren and Camden stand with a FORENSICS EXPERT pouring over
the Volvo With gloved hands he reaches into the car and
pulls out fuzzy fiber

FORENSICS
Looks like they scrubbed down
pretty well But we found this
stuck in the seat belt holder

He holds up something trapped between his fingers--

CAMDEN
What is it

FORENSICS
Couldn’t tell you 100 but my
guess is a jacket fiber

INT TAREN’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY

Taren rifles through her closet thumbing through her
jackets She stops on one pulls it from the closet

She flops down on her bed and scribbles “POSSIBLE MATCH” in
the notebook that’s sprawled out on her covers

INT POLICE PRECINCT - BRIEF ROOM - DAY

Another click The picture of the street where Allison was
found flashes on the screen Another click The car with it’s
doors splayed open fills the screen

CAMDEN
Neither woman live in the area that
they were found However both were
found within a two mile radius of
each other We have reason to
believe the killer is local

Taren flinches at this

INT EXT STREET - NIGHT

Camden and Taren are subtly parked on the side of the road
surveying the night scene Taren frantically rubs her hands
together for warmth while Camden peeks through a set of
binoculars

There’s no one on the street Camden sighs and throws the
binoculars in the backseat

INT TAREN’S APARTMENT - DAY

Taren pins up her receipts from the last few days to the

wall She dots the locations accordingly on a cheap tourist
map that’s been crudely taped to the wall

When she finishes she literally connects the dots creating
a box around the SAME RADIUS that Camden mentioned

INT POLICE PRECINCT - OFFICE - DAY
Taren sits on a desk picking out of a Chinese food

container watching as her partner pins up more pictures on
the board

CAMDEN (VO)
Via reports from both forensics and
the medical examiner we can confirm
that Allison’s time of death was
sometime early in the morning of
January 15th with Jade’s death
following shortly after

He steps back to look at his work-- it’s in-cohesive and
incomplete They’ve got nothing but the brutal work of the
killer staring back at them

He fists his hands in his hair from frustration Taren offers
him the container He takes the olive branch wearily leaning
next to her

INT POLICE PRECINCT - CAMDEN’S OFFICE - DAY

Taren sits curled on her floor pages of her diary ripped out
and strewn next to her feet She looks utterly defeated

Next to her finger something glints She picks it up and we
see that it’s one of the SHARDS from the phone that she
destroyed

She grips the piece hard trying to hold back tears A
dribble of blood wells up and slowly slides down her wrist

As she bleeds we drift to her open notebook The page has
one stark sentence written across it WHAT HAVE I DONE

INT POLICE PRECINCT - BRIEF ROOM - DA

The last click It holds on the SLASH MARKS on the necks of
the victims

CAMDEN
Our profiler has described the
nature of these marks aren’t
reverent like serial killers This
person whomever we’re looking for
he’s violently unstable

That’s it for Taren She can no longer sit still and listen
to Camden’s words She slides from her seat and exits the
briefing room

INT POLICE PRECINCT - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Outside of the room Taren pulls at her collar unbuttoning
the top so she can take a large gulp of air

From here she can see the Chief standing in his office
barking into his phone

JACKSON
The minute we go to the press with
this we blow our anonymity My
guys have it

She steps toward the Chief

TAREN
Chief I need to tell you--

Suddenly the sound of SHOUTING fills the hall catching both
the Chief and Taren’s attention

FEMALE VOICE (0S)
Listen to me

DESK SERGEANT (0S)
Ma’am I need you to calm down

FEMALE VOICE (0S)
You’re not listening All
youre doing is sitting there

The Chief takes off down the hall and Taren follows after

AT THE BULLPEN

Jackson and Taren enter just as the hysterical Shailene Davis
shoves all the contents of the Desk Sergeant’s desk onto the
floor

At this he stands and approaches Shailene palms up

DESK SERGEANT
Ma’am you have to take a deep
breath You’re are in a police
station

SHAILENE
I’ve been calling you for days now
Why aren’t you looking for my
sister I know something’s happened
to her

Jackson looks to Taren and nods toward Shailene

JACKSON
Cuff her until she calms down

Taren begins to move toward Shailene but this only sets her
off

SHAILENE
Don’t fucking touch me I haven’t
done anything wrong It’s you
people It’s all you

TAREN
I understand that you’re upset but
you have to calm down so we can
talk about this

SHAILENE
Wait a minuteI know you You
were there that night I remember

As Taren keeps Shailene distracted the Desk Sergeant comes
from behind her and slaps handcuffs on her

SHAILENE (CONTD)
Hey wait Get these off of me Hey

JACKSON
Get her out of here

The Desk Sergeant forcibly pulls Shailene out of the station
as she shouts toward Taren

SHAILENE
You know something I know you do
What happened that night What
happened to my sister

Taren stares terrified after Shailene as exits

JACKSON
Things are starting to
unravelYou and Camden need to
work faster or we’ll all be
underwater soon

TAREN
I tried to step back Keep this
from happening

JACKSON
No you didn’t Taren You tried to
run away and leave us all in the
lurch

TAREN
And now your pride’s got us in
this

JACKSON
Maybe soFinish it Taren and
that’s the last I’1ll ask of you

EXT PS41 - PARKING LOT - DAY

Taren stands next to a light post a baseball cap covering
her hair and face A gust of wind picks up and she huddles
closer to her jacket

A flyer on the post flaps and she sees a HOMEMADE MISSING
POSTER of Kayla Davis staring back at her With force she
rips it down and crumples it just as students begin to file
out of the school

Taren eyes a woman directing children toward their
respective buses

WOMAN
Ok Jeremy make sure you don’t miss
the bus We don’t want to have to
call your mom again

TAREN
Excuse me miss

WOMAN
Yes hi Are you looking for your
child You can go to the front
office if they knew to expect you-

TAREN
I’m here about a teacher actually
Kayla Davis

The woman’s sweet demeanor falls

WOMAN
How do you know her

TAREN
She works here right

WOMAN
She hasn’t been here in a long
time Haven’t you been watching the
news

TAREN
Did she seem distressed when she
was here Like she knew that she
was in trouble

WOMAN
Look I don’t want to keep talking
about this I think you need to

leave

TAREN
I need to know if she saw this
coming

WOMAN

Saw what coming I’m going to have
call the police if you don’t get
off the property--

Taren violently shoves her badge in the woman’s face

TAREN
I am the police Now answer my
fucking questions

The woman steps back horrified at Taren’s ferocity Taren
herself seems a little taken aback at her unhinged state

TAREN (CONTD)
Gojust go

The woman scampers off but not without looking back every so
often Taren whips off her ball cap to wipe her brow just as
Jason enters into her line of sight

JASON
Taren

TAREN
Oh hi

JASON

I thought that was you What are
you doing out here

TAREN
Work

Jason’s eyes fall to the badge balled in her hand

JASON (CONTD)
A copwow You never said

TAREN
Yeah Listen I’ve got to head out

JASON
You know you never called You said
you would

TAREN
I said that

JASON
It was that bad huh

Taren lets out a shaky laugh

TAREN
Sorry I think I was a little more
tipsy than I thought I didn’t
retain much from that night

The wind picks up again brushing Taren’s hair across her
collarbone Jason smiles as he reaches out to brush it back

JASON
Well I did and Id love to see you
again Taren We had fun at the
baranyway You have my number
As he walks away Taren pulls out her phone dials
TAREN
Hey I need you to try and get
footage from a bar called The Yard
I’1l explain later

FLASHBACK TO

INT PSYCHIATRIST’S OFFICE - DAY
Taren toys with the books on Zach’s bookshelf

ZACH
You go there frequently

TAREN
Huh

ZACH
The bar Was that your first time
being there or do you go often

She stops on one and smiles to herself-- HEART OF DARKNESS by
Joseph Conrad
INT BAR - NIGHT

Picking up after we last saw her screaming at her mother
Taren renters the bar

TAREN (VO)
No it’s around the corner from my
apartment I like to go there and
pretend that I haven’t been staring
at dead bodies all day

ZACH (VO)
But this time was different

TAREN (VO)
Yeah Most of the time I try to
keep my distance give a fake name
But hehe seemed interested

She looks toward the bartender and we realize that it’s the
late Allison Clarke washing glasses

TAREN
Hey have you seen the guy that was
here

ALLISON

Yeah he’s over there

Taren turns to see Jason leaning on the table of Kayla and
Shailene Davis Her falls and she begins to pack up her
belongings

TAREN
Can I close my tab

ALLISON
Sure thing

As Allison turns to the register Jason’s voice sounds behind
Taren

JASON
You running out on me twice in one
night

TAREN

I don’t think this is my night
Besides they’re much prettier

JASON

Them One of them’s my coworker
TAREN

Oh
JASON

Yeah Come on what do you say
Stay a while

INT PSYCHIATRIST’S OFFICE - DAY
Taren flips through Heart of Darkness

ZACH
Why’d you stay

TAREN
I thoughtI thought that I had
earned it That I had worked this
hard to bottle it up for this
moment

Taren slides the book back into the bookshelf

INT TAREN’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Taren sits on her bed clad in an oversized t-shirt her
phone in hand She stares at Jason’s phone number Her
fingers hovers over the phone icon

TAREN (VO)

But I think it was a self-fulling
prophecy I know that I don’t get
that I’m not entitled to all of
that

And then she clicks off her phone and then leans over to turn
off her beside lamp

BACK TO PRESENT

INT TAREN’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - LATER

A LOUD POUNDING outside her door startles Taren awake She
frowns toward the front door listening as the pounding
continues but the words are indiscernible

She scrambles to the edge of her bed just as a loud CRASH
sounds in the main room The sound of BOOTS stomping across
the hardwood floors draw closer and closer

Terrified Taren backs up until she hits the edge of her bed
and falls down-- just as the door of her room bursts open A
SWAT team encircle her led by Jackson and Shailene

JACKSON
Hands where we can see them Taren

SHAILENE
I told you I told you it was her

TAREN
Wait Wait please I can explain
JACKSON
Put your hands up now or we will
shoot
SHAILENE

Shoot her Shoot her for what she
did to my sister

TAREN
Please I can’t remember It’s not
my fault I have this problem
please

JACKSON
Put your hands up now

Taren raises her hands slowly a sob ripping through her
chest

TAREN
Chief you have to believe me I
can’t remember any of it I need

help

SHAILENE
Don’t listen to her lies Look at
where’s she’s gotten you

A member of the SWAT team steps toward Taren and handcuffs

JACKSON
Take her out

Two swat members take Taren by her elbows and forcibly drag
her out of the apartment
EXT STREET - NIGHT

Taren stumbles out into the cold snowy sidewalk still clad
in only her t-shirt Tears stream down her face

TAREN
I didn’t mean to please

Suddenly the men stop short as Anne stands in front of
Taren A KITCHEN KNIFE is in her hand

ANNE
You wanna know what it feels like

Anne steps toward Taren the knife’s edge aimed for her
stomach

TAREN
Please no no

ANNE
Youve been bad Taren Now are you
going to take what you deserve

TAREN
No

Anne THRUSTS THE KNIFE into Taren’s gut and twists it hard
BLOOD begins to pool at Taren’s mouth until--

INT TAREN’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM

Taren’s eyes burst open She’s still in her bed unharmed
Just a nightmare She rubs the sleep from her eyes as her
CELLPHONE buzzes next to her in bed She reaches over and
presses answer

TAREN
Hello

CAMDEN (ON PHONE)
Hey sorry it’s me I know it’s
late but I got the footage

Taren stares at the ceiling for a long moment pressing her
hand against her stomach where her mother stabbed her in the
dream She pulls up her shirt and there’s a LONG SCAR that
decorates her stomach

TAREN
Are you close to your parents

CAMDEN (ON PHONE)

Huh

TAREN
Your parents Are you close to
them

CAMDEN

My parents are dead

TAREN
Oh

CAMDEN
What’s going on Is this your way
of saying you’re not coming

TAREN
No no I’1l be over in twenty

She hangs up the phone

INT POLICE PRECINT - CAMDEN’S OFFICE - NIGHT

Camden and Taren sit side by side looking sleep deprived
despite the coffee cups stewing in front of them They watch
as the footage drones on nothing happening

Camden’s head begins to tip onto Taren’s shoulder as he
starts to doze off She looks at him for a moment in awe of
his peaceful sleep It’s too much for her and she shifts
slightly jolting him awake

CAMDEN
Sorry

TAREN
It’s fine

The tape continues to play Camden feeling awkward toys
with the rim of his mug

CAMDEN
You’re sure this is what we need

TAREN
Both girls were at that bar at some
point before they were killed It’s
our only connection

CAMDEN
Ok

The footage continues Taren turns to Camden a quizzical look
in her eye

TAREN
Ok

CAMDEN
Yeah I trust you If this is what
you think we need to look at then
well look at it

For the first time she gives him a small smile

CAMDEN (CONTD)
Oh my God is that--

On the screen Allison Clarke enters the bar She sees shakes
hand with the manager and he hands her an apron He points at
various things behind the bar

CAMDEN (CONTD)
She worked there We’ve got nothing
on her there No payroll no
uniform nothing

TAREN
Can you fast forward

Camden clicks the mouse and the image speeds up as they watch
the manager train her During this a MAN comes up to the
counter and Allison leans close to him

TAREN (CONTD)
Wait stop--

Camden slows the footage back down and they watch as the man
slips Allison a package She stares after him as he exits

TAREN (CONTD)
What was that Drug money

CAMDEN
Could be Or hush-money I’d bet my
life that’s the guy

TAREN
Let’s get these images blown up so
we run him through the system

Camden drags the mouse back and takes a screenshot of the
guy He prints it out off and grabs the copies from the
printer in the corner of the room When he returns back to
Taren at the desk he’s all smiles

CAMDEN
We fucking did it

Camden claps Taren on the shoulder and gives her an amicable
shake his hand lingering

However the footage on the screen continues playing and out
of the corner of her eye Taren can see HERSELF saunter up to
the bar

As Camden’s head turns to see what’s caught her attention
Taren lunges toward him and the two begin to KISS Camden
revels in it drawing her close

Meanwhile Taren keeps one eye open and drags the mouse until
the footage past her being in the bar past everything
until the screen is finally BLACK

Camden pulls back to look at her Taren’s face reveals
nothing to him

TAREN
We should probably get going

CAMDEN
Yeahyeah you’re right

Camden stands first running a weary hand through his hair
Taren

INT BAR —- DAWN

As the night wears on stragglers stumble out of the bar
trying to find their way home Taren and Camden enter the
near-packed bar searching through the crowd until they see
the MANAGER at the bar

MANAGER
You guys again I told you the
first time I didn’t know anything

CAMDEN
We have evidence that shows Allison
was working here Or at least she
started the day before she died

MANAGER
I don’t know what you’re talking
about--

TAREN

--There was no payroll done No I-
9 nothing See my guess is you
hired her under the table
Bartending is a cash business
right Easy enough to get away
with

CAMDEN
Until she gets murdered

MANAGER
I had nothing to do with that She
said she didn’t want to do the
paperwork ok Sometimes I get ones
like that they don’t want no fuss

CAMDEN
Yeah And where do you get ‘em Are
they lot-lizards You have their
pimps on speed dial

MANAGER
What the fuck are you talking
about

Taren pounds the picture of the man on the footage down onto
the bar

TAREN
This man is he her pimp

MANAGER
I don’t know I’ve never seen him--

TAREN
Obstruction of justice is
considered a felony in the state of
New York Punishable for up to
twenty yearsand by the looks of
youI’m thinking that might be
all you have left How’d you like
to spend your last few breaths in
prison

The manager’s face turns cold Taren and Camden wait
patiently for his response

MANAGER
His name is Tony Danvers Lives on
Canal St Hehe brings them here
when they owe him money Makes them
work it back I don’t know nothing
else about him got it

CAMDEN
Thank you

They begin to walk away from the bar as they reach the door
the manager calls after Taren

MANAGER
You like my bar well enough to get
your fix don’t you Fucking cops

Camden looks toward Taren with a question in his eyes

TAREN
He’s a joke Pathetic

INT APARTMENT COMPLEX - HALLWAY - DAY

Guns drawn Taren and Camden slowly stalk down the deserted
hallway From the end of the hallway LOUD MUSIC thuds
shaking the floor beneath them

They stop outside the door listening

TAREN
You’1l cover me

CAMDEN
I don’t think--

TAREN
We don’t have time to argue about
it Cover me

Camden nods Taren counts off silently 123

INT APARTMENT COMPLEX - TONY’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Taren kicks in the door and immediately she and Camden are
engulfed in the blacklight room

In the living room a GROUP OF MEN doing blow stand up
drawing firearms with no hesitation

MAN 1
What the hell is this

TAREN
Drop your weapons now

MAN 1
Who the fuck do you think you are

CAMDEN
NYPD Put your hands in the air and
get on the ground now

Another man clearly high starts toward Taren gun in hand

MAN 2
You think we give a fuck about some
dumbass cops

Camden strides toward him in one step bringing his gun up to
the man’s temple

CAMDEN
What you think because I got a
badge I won’t fucking do it
(MORE )

CAMDEN (CONTD)
Go head and get yours up here We
can shoot at the same time

The man considers the wild look in Camden’s eyes for a moment
and then sinks to the ground hands behind his head The
others follow in suit Taren doesn’t miss a beat

TAREN
Were looking for a Tony Danvers
Anyone seen him

The men are silent all staring at the ground Taren takes
this moment to unload her shell casing and then reload her
gun one by one All eyes are on the bullets she stocks up

TAREN (CONTD)
Am I really going to have to ask
twice

Suddenly a man in the back reaches for his gun and bolts
Taren shoots toward him but her bullet isn’t fast enough

Taren takes off after him yelling at Camden over her
shoulder

TAREN (CONTD)
Stay here

INT APARTMENT COMPLEX - HALLWAY - DAY

Taren rushes into the hallway to find it empty however she
hears the SLAM of the emergency exit door She dashes to it
throwing open the door

INT APARTMENT COMPLEX - STAIRWELL - DAY

From above Taren can see Tony jumping down the steps five
at a time He looks up to her as she aims her gun down to
him

TAREN
You really going to make me shoot
you Tony

TONY
Fuck you

He aims his gun and fires toward her It misses and a scowl
grows on Taren’s face Without a second thought she follows
after him

EXT STREET - DAY

Taren bursts through the exit door to find Tony nowhere in
sight Suddenly she hears the CLICK of the gun and Tony
reveals himself from behind her

TONY
Got you

TAREN
You think this ends with me Tony
We know where you live now we’ve
got your guys

TONY
So

TAREN
So you’re going to answer for what
youve done With me here or not
Somebody will come ‘round for you

TONY
I haven’t done jack shit

TAREN
Oh yeah what about Allison Clarke
Huh She didn’t give you your money
fast enough so you slit her thorat

TONY
Shut the fuck up You shut the fuck
up right now

TAREN
What happened with Jade huh Was
it the same deal

TONY

Shut up

He raises his hand his finger inching on the trigger but
suddenly a blow comes to the back of his head Camden
appears having hit Tony with the butt of his gun

He doesn’t stop there He kicks Tony hard in the ribs He
then drags Tony up by his hair and crouches down to look at
him

CAMDEN
You like hurting women huh

He hits him again with his gun BLOOD GUSHES from Tony’s
broken nose

CAMDEN (CONTD)
You get off on that

Another hit this time Tony has trouble opening his eye

TONY
P-please

CAMDEN
What’s the matter You don’t like
it

He yanks Tony’s head back further

CAMDEN (CONTD)
And what about those girls Do you
think they liked it

Taren places a tentative hand on Taren’s shoulder

TAREN
Camden That’s enough We got him

Now shaking Camden release Tony who’s nothing more than a
bloody pulp He begins to pace away from Taren hands fisted
in his hair trying to process what he’s just done

INT OBESRVATION ROOM - POLICE PRECINCT - DAY

Leaving Tony behind Taren enters the observation room where
Camden stares at the plexiglass with hollow eyes

TAREN
His alibi’s airtight He’s not a
killer just a lowlife pusher

They don’t speak for a long moment Finally Camden sighs

CAMDEN
I wanted it to be him

TAREN
It’s fine We’ll just have to
restart Lets go over the boards
again--

CAMDEN
We have nothing Taren

TAREN
Sowe go back to the bar start
interrogating the regulars

CAMDEN
Do you ever think about the way
that we found that car It was like
he was presenting it to us This
guy whoever he is we’re not
finding him until he wants us to

Taren bites her lip down and then proceeds

TAREN
But what if its too late

Camden slips a smile on

CAMDEN
Come on let’s get you home We
both could use a breather

INT HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF TAREN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Taren walks in front of Camden and stops outside of her door

TAREN
You really didn’t have to come up

CAMDEN
I know I guess I’m still wired I
keep checking corners expecting one
of Tony’s boys to show up

TAREN
Not the first time I’ve had to deal
with a death threat

She smiles while saying this but Camden looks as if he’s
been slapped

TAREN (CONTD)
Look you don’t have to worry about
me

Camden stares down as he clenches and unclenches his bruised
fist

CAMDEN
I don’t know ifI don’t know if I
have the sensibility for any of
this

TAREN
Camden

CAMDEN
I used to ask myself what kind of
person can do something so sick
But today god when I saw you at
gunpointI think I realized that
darkness lingers around Just
waiting for it’s moment to get out

Taren looks away not wanting to give herself away
CAMDEN (CONTD)
Maybe to catch a monster you have
to become oneand I just don’t
think I’m willing to do that

Taren reaches out to him

TAREN
Hey--

CAMDEN

Let me stay I can’t leave you

alone tonight I won’t
Taren doesn’t answer Instead she unlocks the front door and
steps inside waiting for Camden to come in after her

Taren lies curled up next to Camden as the light of morning

INT DINER - DAY

Face hidden under a baseball cap Taren sits in a booth
hidden from the rest of the diner She picks at the pancakes
in front of her but can’t seem to find her appetite

Her phone resting on the table vibrates with a call
CAMDEN’S CALLER ID flashes across the screen Taren stares at
it until the buzzing finally ceases

A WAITRESS enters Taren’s line of sight refilling her coffee
cup Her attention however is focused on the TV screen
above the counter

WAITRESS
That’s just sick Sometimes I just
can’t understand this world

Taren looks over to see that its playing highlights of the
“New York Serial Killer”

WAITRESS (CONTD)
Can I get you anything else

TAREN
No

As the waitress leaves Taren throws a crumpled bill on the
table and darts leaving her pancakes and coffee behind
IE TAREN’S CAR - NIGHT

Night has fallen once more and Taren parks her car outside a
large brown building that reads “KANSAS CITY PSYCHIATRIC
FACILITY”

With a deep breath she steels herself and exits the car
heading toward the building

INT PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY - FRONT DESK - NIGHT

A nurse sits filing her nails and watching Spanish soaps on
the small TV that rests on her desk Taren taps loudly on the
glass that separates them

TAREN
Hi I need to see Anne Evans

NURSE
I’m sorry are you family

TAREN
Yes I’m her daughter Which room
is she in

NURSE
It’s after hours Your mother is
probably asleep

TAREN
Then wake her up

NURSE
If you’d like you can come back at
an later hour when it will be more
convenient for us--

Taren pounds on the glass again

TAREN
I’m with the NYPD I need to speak
with her now 255-45-89’s my badge
number You can run it but in the
meantime which room is my mother
in

INT PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY - ANNES ROOM - NIGHT
A nurse helps a groggy Anne sit up in her bed
NURSE

I’m sorry Anne can I get you

anything

ANNE
A glass a milk My daughter will
have one too

TAREN
No thank you

The nurse nods and exits the room
ANNE
I’ve been waiting for you Ellie

TAREN
No it’s Taren now I left that
name a long time ago

ANNE
Why would you do something like
that

TAREN

I didn’t want to risk the chance of
somebody linking me to you and all
your crazy

The nurse returns and sets down a glass of milk for Anne

NURSE
I’1l just be outside Annie

She looks between mother and daughter and then exits once

more

ANNE
It’s cruel what you’ve done to me
Ellie

TAREN
Really I think it’s justifiable

ANNE
I gave you life I birthed you I
fed you And now you’ve left me to
rot with these strangers

TAREN
And maybe that’s what you deserve

ANNE
I never asked for any of this
sweetie But God saw fit to--

TAREN
Stop it Bring up God again and
I’1ll leave Right fucking now God
has nothing to do with you and your
fucked up mind

Anne bites her tongue and instead sips from her glass

milk

of

ANNE
So why are you here If you don’t
want to talk to me or hell even
look at me why’d you come all this
way hon

TAREN
I needed to see for myself

ANNE
See what

TAREN
What I could become

Realization passes over Anne’s weathered face

ANNE
Ah it’s happening to you too
isn’t it

TAREN
I left you I left all of this
behind because I thought it would
help

Taren stands and goes by the window She tries to crack it
open to get some air but the locks keep it from moving up
more than a couple of centimeters

ANNE
So we won’t try to jump Come back
on over here and let me give you
your answers

TAREN
I’m fine here

ANNE

God you look so much like your
father

Taren starts on her anger flashing in her eyes

TAREN
How dare you

ANNE
What

TAREN
How dare you mention him to me

ANNE
He was my husband Ellie

TAREN
And you murdered him You ran him
right through and when that wasn’t
enough you went after me

She lifts up her shirt to reveal the scar that we’ve seen
before Anne looks away but Taren moves closer forcing her
mother to look

TAREN (CONTD)
And you know what’s worse You
should be in jail right now You
should be on death row But instead
they threw you up here because you
couldn’t remember what happened
Because somehow you weren’t
“mentally sound”

ANNE
I have a disease Taren

TAREN
Oh please

ANNE
Dissaciotiave Identity Disorder
affects the mind--

TAREN
Screw you And screw your disease
You think that you talk to a shrink
for a few sessions and suddenly
every bad thing you’ve ever done is
erased No-- you wanted to kill
him admit it

ANNE
I fell out of love with your father
that’s true but I never wished
harm on him or you You’re my
family

TAREN
And look what that’s gotten us
Dads dead You’ve lost it And
I’ve spent the last ten years
hunting down people like you
because I can’t wrap my hands
around your own neck
ANNE
Do it then Right here Taren If
you can’t live with what we
struggle with then end it now Oh
but be sure to make it look real
good because I doubt the Nurses
will let you leave unquestioned

TAREN
That’s just what you’d like isn’t
it To see me pick up where you
left off

ANNE
Why does this abhor you so much
Taren Have you been so brainwashed
that you think that you’re damaged
goods the minute your brain isn’t
fully under your control

TAREN
No mother what abhors me is that
youre still alive

Silence hangs in the air at this

ANNE
I never pretended to be a good
mother I did what I could Worked
to keep you fed loved your father
as best I could But sometimes
things slip

Taren turns from the window at this

ANNE (CONT’D)
I know enough now to discern the
bad things that I’ve done and
things I had no control over But
sometimes the mindsometimes it
takes control and you can’t fight
it You just have to live with it

TAREN
And what You become comfortable
with killing You become OK with
losing your mind

ANNE
My disease didn’t make me crazy
Taren trying to run from it did

Taren moves back to the chair opposite her mother She sits
down and reaches for the glass of milk Anne watches with a
slight smile as Taren finishes the glass

ANNE (CONTD)
It always did calm you down

TAREN
I don’t understand how you can be
so still I feel like nothing makes
sense anymore

ANNE
That’s fear talking You’ve got to
listen to it

TAREN
Yeah And what am I supposed to
hear

ANNE

You have to quit fighting it
Accept it and move forward

TAREN
How did we end up like this

ANNE
Genetics is a bitch hon If you
listened to nothin’ else take that
piece of advice to heart

TAREN
I don’tI don’t think I can be a
cop anymore Not like this

ANNE
Good Come back home Ellie We can
move back into your grandmothers
house

Anne reaches a hand to Taren but she sits up

TAREN
I told you It’s Taren now

ANNE
Ell-Taren Why won’t you stay We
can work on this-- the both of us
I need you

TAREN
And I needed Dad I understand now
but it’s one thing the disease
wont let me forget

ANNE
Ellie don’t leave me in here

Taren goes to the door the Nurse rushes in after her at
Anne’s screams

ANNE (CONT’D)
Ellie you can’t leave me here to
die Ellie

The door to Anne’s room shuts

EXT PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY - NIGHT

Taren sits on the hood of her car watching as snow flurries
build up again She digs her phone out of her pocket takes a
deep breath and finally dials Camden

CAMDEN
Taren Where the hell are you I’ve
been trying to call

TAREN
HeyuhI’m not in New York

CAMDEN

need to tell you

CAMDEN
Yeah me too

TAREN
Look this case I need to get off

CAMDEN

Wait until I tell you--

TAREN
No Camden you don’t understand I

fault And I didn’t want to think
about that possibility but I have
to come clean--

CAMDEN
--These cases happen Bodies but no
clues But Taren I’m telling you I
found a clue

TAREN
What

CAMDEN
Jade Hoechlin’s ID It was fake

TAREN
Then who is she

CAMDEN
She’s a runaway Don’t know why we
didn’t run her prints She’s been
in and out of the system

TAREN
She was right there for us

CAMDEN
Yeah get this We have an address
for her I went and checked her
place-- there’s nothing there

TAREN
Great

CAMDEN
I go around talking to the
neighbors and one guys saying how
he’s been hearing his upstairs
neighbor coming in at all hours of
the night

TAREN
Oh my god

CAMDEN
I’m getting the warrant Are
youare you coming back anytime
soon I know it’s none of my
business but I saw your gun and
badge Taren and I thinkI think

Taren puts down the phone for a brief moment She breathes a
sigh

TAREN
If it’s not him will you promise
me something

CAMDEN
Sure anything

TAREN
Don’t make me stay

A beat then--

CAMDEN
Done

TAREN
Then I’m on my way

Taren shuts down the phone and gives one last look to the
psych ward Shaking her head she opens her car door and
slides in the front seat

TAREN (VO)
It’s selfish really but I
couldn’t let myself lose like that
I have too much pride I didn’t
want to admit defeat Maybe that’s
what started me down this path

FLASHBACK TO

INT PSYCHATRIST’S OFFICE - DAY
Taren’s smiling at Zach who looks up from his notepad

ZACH

TAREN
Yeah I saw her face The girl he
had been talking to at the bar I

wish I didn’t have to fake

INT BAR - NIGHT

Taren and Jason arm and arm are exiting the bar Taren takes
one last look over her shoulder She locks eyes with
Elizabeth who stares dejectedly as she watches Jason leave
with another girl

TAREN (VO)
I didn’t even really want him And
I knew the she did And that made
mehappy

INT PSYCHATRIST’S OFFICE - DAY
Taren’s smile widens

TAREN
It made me happy to know that she
was losing everything while I got
what I wanted

ZACH

TAREN
Yes Because I was in control

BACK TO PRESENT

INT APARTMENT — DAY

Camden putting his all his weight on the door bursts into
the room He drops the warrant that’s crumpled in his hand as
he enters

CAMDEN
What the hell

Taren’s not far behind him and flicks on the light switch
illuminating the room in a harsh yellow light

She takes a step back as her eyes take in the sights around
the room Hundreds of blown up pictures are scattered across
the walls of BRUTALLY CLOSE PORTRAITS OF WOMEN only taken
from the neck up

Taren draws closer to a nearby set of photos and she sees
that each have a RED SEMICIRCLE drawn haphazardly across
their necks The picture she stares at is one of Elizabeth
Holmes

CAMDEN (CONTD)
He labeled them

Taren turns to see what he means He points to a makeshift
corkboard above an old desk It harbors a list of names and
across from them the nicknames that Camden mentioned

CAMDEN (CONTD)
He planned them Each one he knew
when exactly he wanted them
revealed and when He wants
everyone to see the work he’s done

Something inside of Taren snaps she begins racing toward the
walls and tears down the photos one by one Camden comes from
behind her restraining her arms until she can calm down

CAMDEN (CONTD)
Hey hey I’m just as pissed as you
are but that’s evidence

TAREN
Don’t you get it It’s a taunt
We’re not pulling any fucking
strings here We never have been

CAMDEN
Taren--—

TAREN
No fuck it Fuck it all I’m one
of them now Camden I tried ok I
tried but it’s enough I need to
go to the station

CAMDEN
Taren look

He points to the ground at one of the pictures that Taren had
torn down He crouches low to the ground and picks it up
handling it with feather-light care

Taren looks down to see what the picture holds It’s a
photograph of her neck and shoulders asleep in her bed
Across the top it’s labeled as “THE ANOMALY” and slashes are
marked along her throat

CAMDEN (CONTD)
I think he wants us to know where
he’s going next

TAREN
This whole timehe’s been making
me think

CAMDEN

What do you want to do
TAREN
I’m going to gut him
INT TAREN’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Taren calmly on her bed as she watches UNIFORMED COPS flit
across her room checking for wires and cameras

The last of them turns to Camden who stands off in a corner
watching the uniforms work

UNIFORM 1
It’s clear He didn’t bug it
CAMDEN
Thanks You can and your crew can
go
UNIFORM 1

Do you want us to standby

CAMDEN
No I’1l stay with her tonight

The uniform leaves and it’s just Taren and Camden alone in
the room He takes a step forward shedding his coat

CAMDEN (CONTD)
Filed the apartment under a fake
name Paid in cash of course The
bastard’s really starting to get
under my skin

TAREN
You didn’t have to

Camden stands inches away from her He tilts her head toward
him and kisses her deeply

CAMDEN
Yes I did

TAREN
Why Just because I’m your partner

CAMDEN
No because I admire you Because I
want you Is that so crazy

TAREN
Yes

He bends to kiss her again

CAMDEN
Then I’m crazy

Taren jolts away
TAREN
You don’t know anything about being
crazy Camden You’re the most
cookie-cutter person I’ve ever met

CAMDEN
Oh what now you’ve got the market
on crazy I’m a cop Taren same as
you I’ve seen the same messed up
shit that you’ve seen

TAREN
And you ran

CAMDEN
What

TAREN

You ran You left Connecticut
because you got scared didn’t you
And then you came to New York to
prove to yourself that you could do
it again

CAMDEN
I know what you’re doing and it’s
not working so quit while you’re
ahead

TAREN
What am I doing besides telling the
truth

CAMDEN
They all gave up on you-- the
Chief IID hell even Mahoney left
you in the dust And you think
youve got some fucking chip on
your shoulder now but you don’t
because I know beneath all the
steely exterior is a person who
actually cares

TAREN
How would you even begin to assume
that

CAMDEN
Because if anybody that I knew
reviewed by the IID they would
have never come back But you did
Taren You did You care about this
job You care about putting the bad
people away

TAREN
I don’t--

Taren’s words are cutoff by a the sound of a knock at the
front door Camden steels at the sound his hand going
instantly to his gun He puts a finger to his lips Taren
nods understanding and draws her own gun

INT TAREN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The two stalk quietly into the foyer as another KNOCK sounds
Slowly Camden turns the knob and then flings the door open
pointing his gun at the visitor

CAMDEN
Freeze Hands in the air now

Taren comes next to Camden to see Jason standing still with
his hands up staring at Camden with a look to kill

TAREN
Jason

JASON
Taren what is this

TAREN
Put your gun down I know him

Camden lowers his gun but looks at Jason with an intent to
kill

TAREN (CONTD)
What are you doing here

JASON
You never called so uhI just
wanted to see you again This is
weird isn’t it I didn’t expect
you to be here with someone else

Camden looks back and forth between Jason and Taren shaking
his head

CAMDEN
That makes two of us

He clips his gun back to his holster and then shoves past
Jason striding down the hall Taren takes off after him
sliding past him to stand in his way

TAREN
I thought you were staying

CAMDEN
I changed my mind

TAREN
Because another man showed up at my
door You were never my boyfriend
Camden you’re my partner

CAMDEN
I lied before-- what you were
doing what you’ve done it worked
So I’m going just liked you wanted

TAREN
I never said that’s what I wanted
I just said I didn’t understand why
you were sticking around

Camden makes a move to go around her and she holds onto his
forearm trying to make herself

TAREN (CONTD)
But II appreciate it ok I had
all this shit going on and but you
stuck around and I just

Camden grimaces

CAMDEN
It’s worse because you can’t even
see yourself

He brushes past her without another word Taren glares after
him tears filling in her eyes

JASON
He’s wrong I think you know
exactly who you are

Taren turns back toward him suddenly remembering that he’s
still standing outside her door

JASON (CONT’D)
It’s why I came You’re the realest
person I’ve ever met Taren No
decorations No frills

TAREN
Nohe’s right You know how I
spend my Friday nights I dress up
and pretend I’m happy so I can get
guys like you to think I’m normal
But I’m not

JASON
Just let me come in--

TAREN
I’m sorry I think I just need to
be alone

She steps inside the door and watches as Jasons face becomes
smaller and smaller as the door shuts

INT TAREN’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Taren enters her bedroom and sees Camden’s jacket still
laying on the floor She bends down and picks it up adorning
it

She lays down on the floor and closes her eyes a tear
sliding down her cheek

FLASHBACK TO

INT BAR - NIGHT

In an out of body experience Taren watches as her past self
and Jason begin to exit the bar

In slow motion she sees Jason turn back to glance at
Elizabeth The past Taren notices and looks back at
Elizabeth to see Elizabeth getting up and paying her tab

As they begin to exit Taren can hear Elizabeth and Shailene
arguing

SHAILENE
Just forget him ok

ELIZABETH
Let me go Shai

SHAILENE
Why are you letting some guy get
your panties in a twist Jesus
It’s the city there’s a ton of men
here

ELIZABETH
I just don’t feel like being out
anymore

EXT BAR - NIGHT

Taren watches as her past self and Jason walk hand in hand
down the street Inside the bar Elizabeth packs her things
to go Then it all goes BLACK

BACK TO PRESENT

EXT TAREN’S APARTMENT - FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

Taren wakes up huddled in Camden’s jacket on her fire
escape She cradles her head digging her nails into her
temples trying to force herself to remember the rest

But nothing comes

EXT STREET - DAY

Baseball cap low over her eyes Taren exits her apartment
She locks eyes with the COPS in the PATROL CAR across the
street watching her apartment for suspicious activity

Taren pulls the cap lower and jams her hands in her pockets
walking quickly down the street now The car pulls out of its
space to follow her

She gives a glance behind her shoulder at it and then quickly
darts into a back alley The car picks up speed going down
the next street to cut her off

She stops and turns the other way sprinting back the way she
came The car can’t turn around fast enough and she’s bolting
down another alley

After a moment she stops-- the patrol car is nowhere to be
seen

EXT BANK — DAY

Taren stands across the street staring into the glass
windows of a bank Inside of the bank she watches Shailene
slowly pack up her belongings She waves goodbye to her
coworkers and exits Taren makes her move

She walks in step with Shailene across the street before she
crosses onto the other side

Taren follows behind her for a long time just watching as
the young woman walks

And then suddenly she pounces dragging her down an narrow
empty street She covers Shailene’s mouth not allowing her
to scream

TAREN
I’ve been thinking about it
Shailene and it doesn’t make sense
to me

SHAILENE
What are you talking about

TAREN
Your sister You’re right I was
there that night And so were you
She wanted to leave early isn’t
that right

SHAILENE
So what What the hell are you
trying to say

TAREN
You were there together Shailene
She went out with you she should
have left with you So where did
she go

SHATLENE
I don’t know

Taren shoves the other girl roughly against the brick wall
behind them

TAREN
I’ve been up and down the last few
weeks thinking about what I’m
missing but all this time it was
you You were the last piece Where
did you your sister go Shailene

SHATLENE
She left without me

TAREN
Stop lying I want to catch who did
this I need to know where she
went

SHAILENE
I wanted to stay and she was
jealous about that guy you were
with She didn’t wait for me

Taren rattles her hard

TAREN
Stop lying

SHATLENE
You have to believe me Please

At the top of the street the patrol car that had been
tailing Taren finally pulls up An uniformed officer gets out
of the car running toward Taren

UNIFORM 1
Detective Saint

Taren shakes Shailene too hard this time and the young girl’s
head hits the brick wall with a loud CRACK Taren watches as
the girl slips through her hands and crumples to the ground
below

Taren looks on in horror as the girl lays unconscious with a
stream of blood pouring down her nose

UNIFORM 1 (CONT’D)
What the hell are you did you do

Taren looks down at her hands as they shake with adrenaline

TAREN
I need to knowI need to know

MATCH CUT TO

INT POLICE PRECINT - JACKSON’S OFFICE - DAY

Taren stares at her hands while across the desk Jackson
sits with his head in hands

JACKSON
I don’t see how IID will overlook
this

TAREN
She’s alive It was just a
concussion

JACKSON
No it was assault She could press
charges against you

The Chief gets up and sits on the edge of his desk looking
wearily down at Taren

JACKSON (CONTD)
I think what would be best for
everyone if you take a minute while
we take care of this Lay low and
let our guys get this guy before he
gets to you

TAREN
Oh come on weeks ago I wanted off
and now when we’re actually close
to finishing this you’re going to
kick me out That’s bullshit Chief
and you know it I’m this close
This close

JACKSON
Camden requested a new partner
That’s happened twice now Taren

Taren blanches blindsided by this news

TAREN
When did he--

JACKSON
--I’ve never doubted that you were
a good cop Taren But I’m starting
to wonder if you’ve forgotten how
to be a good person

This stings harder than anything anyone has ever said Taren
can’t even meet his eyes

TAREN
I was messed up before Ok I
didn’t think I had things together
but I do now I do And I need to
get this finished

JACKSON
It’s just until this killer’s gone
Taren You need to get away from
this grime before it eats you
alive

TAREN
But wholl finish the case Camden
can’t do it by himself--

JACKSON
I put Mahoney on it Now go Taren
I don’t want to see you back in
here until this is done For your
sake

TAREN
You know damn well this isn’t for
me

Taren bolts from the room leaving Jackson looking stricken

INT PSYCHATRIST’S OFFICE - DAY

Zach places a hand on Taren’s shoulder It’s the first time
they gotten this close Taren notes it

ZACH
Why are you so afraid of being out
of control

TAREN
Because then people turn you into
their own version of you You can
never be yourself

ZACH
Don’t you think that’s overly
pessimistic Nobody can control who
you or what you do but you

Taren’s eyes lingers on his hand on her shoulder Then she
looks up at Zach with a grimace

TAREN
That’s not true

INT TAREN’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY

Taren stands in front of the sink looking down at a days of
the week pill container She looks back up at the mirror--
her face looks worn out and gaunt

TAREN (VO)
It’s a subtle change at first You
start doing little favors for them
Then suddenly you’re picking up the
words that they use You find
yourself waking up every morning in
a bad mood but you can never
remember why

She picks up the pills for Monday and then throws them back

INT TAREN’S APARTMENT - DAY

Taren sits curled on her couch in sweatpants her hair
astray In her lap she has the daily newspaper spread out
across her legs The headline reads “KILLER STILL AT LARGE”
Taren jots down notes across the paper

TAREN (VO)
They make you retract and reshape
so you can fit into their little
bubble

Across from her the TV blares a news report relaying the
same tired information

NEWS ANCHOR
Upon the discovery of new
information local authorities have
discovered the remains of at least
six women who were perceived to be
missing

Faces of HAPPY WOMEN flash across the scene
NEWS ANCHOR (CONTD)
Precinct Chief Jackson declined to

comment on the new discoveries

Frustrated Taren throws the remote at it and shoves the
newspapers to the floor as she rises from the couch

EXT POLICE PRECINT - DAY

Taren stands against a telephone pole patiently waiting
Suddenly her face perks up as she sees Camden and Mahoney
exit the precinct She hurries across the street calling to
Camden

TAREN
Camden I need to talk to you

Camden sees her but keeps walking toward the precinct parking
lot brushing past her as if she were an apparition

TAREN (CONTD)
Really We’re doing this now

Taren turns to pursue him but Mahoney blocks her path

TAREN (CONTD)
This is none of your business

MAHONEY
He’s my partner now so it is
Instead of chasing after him how
about you do us a favor and lay
low If that killer sees you
hanging around the precinct he’s
never going to show his face again

TAREN
Why So you can make the arrest and
take the credit for something you
had nothing to do with

MAHONEY
You can be as bitter as you like
but it doesn’t change the fact that
he’s done with you and as soon as
we bag this guy everyone else will
be too

TAREN
What’s that supposed to mean

Mahoney grimaces and instead of answering her turns to
follow Camden

INT BAR - NIGHT

Taren has squeezed herself in a tight black dress and shiny
pumps to match As she enters the bar she waves to a person
at a table and walks over

Jason sits already sipping on a beer Like a good-manner
gentleman he rises as Taren sits and then returns to his
seat

JASON
You look stunning

TAREN
Thanks

JASON

To be honest I’m really surprised
you finally called The last time I
thought I’d crossed a line

TAREN
Well you know what they say
Timing is everything

JASON
It is Can I get you something

TAREN
Whatever you have is good

Jason smiles signaling the waiter He continues talking to
her but Taren isn’t listening to a word he says Instead
her eyes are trained on Anne who sits with her hands folded
neatly across from Taren

ANNE
A date Really Answer this Do you
even remember the last time you had
an original thought Or have you
always operated like you were under
someone’s thumb

Taren balls her hand into a fist biting back a response In
her movement a piece of her hair falls across her shoulders
Jason smiles and sweeps it back fingers lightly brushing
against her neck

Their eyes catch
ANNE (CONT’D)
When are you going to wake up
EXT BAR - LATER
Jason and Taren are locked in an embrace against the side of
the bar Next to them Anne leans against the wall
apathetically smoking a cigarette

Jason steps back lightly caressing her neck

JASON
Come back to my place

ANNE
Are you going to stop acting like a
child Two wrongsyou’ve heard
that expression haven’t you

Taren runs her hand through her hair

TAREN
Just stop

JASON
Come on Taren Just come back with
me

TAREN

I--I can’t

He continues kissing her and Taren gets caught up in it
Jason starts to lead her down the street and Taren steps
back coming to her senses

TAREN (CONTD)
Not tonight

A dark look passes over Jasons face and his voice is low and
haunting

JASON
You seriously aren’t making this
easy

Taren stares at him contemplative as the wheels in her head
start to turn

TAREN
Maybe some other time

He smiles with feigned enthusiasm

JASON
Yeah Maybe

Hands stuffed in his pockets Jason turns and walks down the
street

BRIEFLY WE FLASH TO

The pictures of the girls-- Jade Elizabeth Allison and the
countless others Their necks SEVERED And Jason’s fingers
lightly brushing across Taren’s neck his lips on her
collarbone

WE’RE BACK and after a few beats Taren begins to follow
after him murder written in her eyes

INT STORAGE FACILITY - NIGHT

Taren hides in the shadows as she watches Jason approach a
storage block He crouches placing the key in the lock and
steps back as the door slides upwards

Taren cautiously waits as he disappears inside for a few
brief moments and then exits carrying a large bag He closes
the door once more and makes his way down the hall

After a few moments Taren slips from her cover and moves
toward the lock She rolls up her dress to her thigh and
uncovers out her gun

She shoots at the lock through her oversized purse
attempting to muffle the sound The lock tumbles to the
ground and the door springs open

INSIDE THE ROOM

Are several PICTURES like the ones found in the apartment In
the center there’s a small table with an assortment of
different weapons-- axes knives wrenches

As the realization floods over her Taren runs out of the
room She digs out her phone and hastily dials Camden He
picks up on the second ring

CAMDEN
I don’t know what else I have to do
to get you to understand that--

TAREN
I found him

CAMDEN
What

TAREN

I fucking found him Camden It’s
that slimeball that you saw at my
door the other night

CAMDEN
Who

In her frenzied horror she starts to manically laugh

TAREN
He was fucking with me This whole
time

CAMDEN

Slow down Taren I don’t
understand what you’re--

TAREN
--I’m going after him Camden
Please don’t make me do it alone

CAMDEN
Taren wait-—-

She ends the call and sinks to the floor trying to calm her
breath

Finally composed she dials another number

TAREN
Hey Jason look I’m sorry about
earlier I justI was just
overthinking things Could I still
come over Yeah Ok Great I’1ll be
there soon

Taren ends the call and the first genuine smile we’ve seen
from her breaks across her face

EXT JASON’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Taren stands outside the door with her cellphone in hand She
texts the address to Camden and then puts her phone away
finally knocking

Jason opens the door smiling any signs of his earlier
frustration gone

JASON
Hey come in

INT JASON’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Jason leads the way into the studio apartment-- lavish for a
school teacher’s salary As Taren walks deeper into the
apartment Jason darts behind the kitchen counter opening
the fridge

JASON
Can I get you something to drink
Wine

TAREN

Whatever’s fine

Taren walks around the apartment visually logging everything
she sees Jason appears by her side and hands her a glass

JASON
Cheers

He tips his drink back but Taren doesn’t move her glass at
all

TAREN
It’s different than I thought it’d
be

JASON

What

TAREN

Your apartment Where are the
pictures

JASON
I don’t think I understand

Taren slowly begins to dump the contents of her drink onto

the floor

TAREN
The pictures of the women you want

to kill Where are they

Jasons face turns ice cold In an instant he drops his
glass and LUNGES toward Taren Her glass falls too and she
pulls out her gun and points it directly at Jason’s face

JASON
So you do remember You little
bitch You made me believe that you
had no clue--

TAREN
--No clue That night with
Elizabeth you did do something to
me

Jason stays silent Taren cocks her pistol at his face
placing her gun right between his eyes

FLASH TO

TAREN (CONTD)
Tell me what happened that night

JASON
You came back with me I have to
say it was a lot easier the first
time around

INT JASON’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Taren and Jason stumble into his apartment mouths pressed
together They break apart briefly as Jason goes around the
counter to pour her a drink

JASON
Here have a little wine

TAREN
Are you trying to get me drunk

JASON
Maybe

They take a few sips staring at one another Finally it’s
too much Taren lunges at Jason and they begin tearing at one
another’s clothes

INT JASON’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

They’re in Jason’s bed naked and entwined Taren’s head
rests on his chest as she pretends to be asleep

Suddenly a LOUD POUNDING comes from the front door Jason
wakes as it continues He slides out from underneath Taren as
he goes to answer the door

Taren sits up as she listens in to the voices in the foyer

JASON (0S) (CONTD)
Hey Lizze-- what are you doing
here

ELIZABETH (0S)
I’m sorry I justI saw you at
the bar with that girl and I
justI really need to let you
know how I feel

JASON (0S)
Lizzie I don’t--

ELIZABETH (0S)
Oh my god I’m so stupid She’s
here isn’t she Shit just forget
what I said Ok I’ll see you
Monday

JASON (0S)
No wait

There’s no sound and Taren leaves the bed slipping on her t-
shirt As she approaches the door she opens it a crack and
sees Jason and Elizabeth tangled in an embrace

He takes Elizabeth and dips her onto the couch Taren begins
to avert her eyes maybe go back and get the rest of her
clothes until she hears LOUD CHOKING sounds

ELIZABETH
St--stop Whatwhatare

She nudges the door open a little wider and sees Jason with
one hand on Elizabeth’s neck and the other fishing through
her pockets Finally he finds what he’s looking for and
withdraws her keys

INT JASON’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Taren bursts through the door running to aid Elizabeth

TAREN
What the fuck are you doing

She goes to stop him but she’s not fast enough-- he PLUNGES
a key haphazardly across Elizabeth’s neck Instantly the
blood begins to bubble and spill over

Taren makes it to Jason and she flings a punch at him It
connects and Jason goes tumbling backward off the couch and
hits the floor with a loud CRACK Taren looks over to
Elizabeth who’s trying to cover the blood rush

TAREN (CONTD)
I’m going to get you some help

INT JASON’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

She dashes back into the bedroom trying to find her phone
She crouches to her pants and finally gets her cellphone
when there’s a loud THUD against the back of her head

Everything goes dark

BACK TO PRESENT

INT JASON’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Taren stares at Jason completely stricken

JASON
I meant it to be you I drugged
your wine Got you good and
tiredit was set But then the
more I spent with you I realized
there was something wrong with
you

TAREN
And what Elizabeth came and you
just changed your mind
JASON
I have to say that was a pleasant
surprise But herI’ve been
planning for her for a while now
She’s good like the others
Hopeful clean bright

TAREN
Youre disgusting

JASON
Am I And yet you came back here
that night You wanted me

TAREN
Because I thought you were

JASON
And I thought you were too But
youre not There’s something cold
in you You don’t deserve to be
revered like my other girls So I
left you there hoping someone
would find you and get rid of you

TAREN
You didn’t know I was a cop

JASON
No I didn’t But the minute I
learned you didn’t know what I had
done I knew I needed to finish it

TAREN
Why You could’ve gotten away with
it Nobody suspected you

JASON
Isn’t that obvious

TAREN
Not to me

JASON

You’re cold and you pretend to be
warm just like me And well there
can’t be two of us

TAREN
Don’t you dare lump us together

JASON
But you are That’s why you haven’t
pulled the trigger yet Because
youre interested

TAREN
Shut the fuck up

JASON
Just admit it Taren

TAREN

Shut up

As she gets riled up Jason jumps at her knocking her to the
ground Her gun goes SPRAWLING out of her hand Above her
now Jason lands a hard blow across her face Taren’s head
snaps back and hits the hardwood floor below

While she clears the stars from her eyes Jason scrambles
over to her gun But Taren’s faster and she jumps on Jason’s
back locking him in a chokehold Grasping for air Jason
claws hard at Taren’s face behind him

Suddenly he jabs his arm back hard and as the breath leaves
Taren she releases Jason He reaches for the gun once more
but this time the sound of a pistol cocking stops him

Taren and Jason turn to see Camden standing in the doorway

CAMDEN
Hands in the air Now

TAREN
Youre here
CAMDEN
Yeah Thanks for leaving the door

unlocked

Gun still raised Camden approaches Jason He kicks Taren’s
gun back toward her With force Camden yanks Jason’s hands
back and restrains them in handcuffs As he does this he
looks to Taren for answers

CAMDEN (CONT’D)
How

TAREN
He goes to the bar where Allison
worked That’s he met her Jade was
his neighbor Elizabethhe worked
with her

Camden sets Jason down on the floor and moves to Taren He
takes her by the shoulders and gives her an affectionate
shake

CAMDEN
Hey you got him That’s all that
matters now

JASON
She saw what happened to Elizabeth
did she tell you that

CAMDEN
You don’t get to talk

JASON
This whole time she was too much of
a coward to tell you what she knew
because she was a afraid of being
locked up like me

TAREN
Stop

JASON
It’s kind of funny really You
string her up and hold her at these
high places but she’s really just
a fucking horrible person

Without a word Taren slips from underneath Camden’s grasp
and begins to move toward Jason Suddenly ANNE APPEARS next
to Taren as she picks up her gun from the floor

ANNE
It’s choosing time honeybee

JASON
Look at your insides Taren you’1l
see They’re painted pitch black

TAREN
You’re right

She raises the gun and SHOOTS HIM straight through the
forehead

CAMDEN
Fuck Taren

Taren wipes away the blood splattered on her face and she
holds her hand out to Camden

TAREN
I need the key for the cuffs
CAMDEN
Why the hell did you do that We
had him
TAREN

The key Camden

He fishes for it and then hands it over to her She uncuffs
Jason and then gets to work staging his body

Camden watches as she does this sinking down against a
nearby wall

CAMDEN
This is insane

INT POLICE PRECINT - DAY

FLASHING LIGHTS fill the room as the Chief holds yet another
press conference

Taren stands by his side beaming Next to her is Camden who
looks ill

JACKSON
While we knew that Detective Saint
was a potential target for the
suspect suspicions were proven to
be true when Detective Saint was
kidnapped by the suspect Upon her
abduction she managed to get word
out to her partner Detective
Camden While she was apprehended
the suspect became violent with her
and Detective Saint was forced to
use her weapon to end his life and
protect her own

Camden looks over at Taren a hard look in his eyes

JACKSON (CONTD)
I think I speak for the precinct
when I saw that we are grateful for
Detective Camden’s diligence and
that Detective Saint made it out of
the situation unharmed

The room erupts in APPLAUSE Taren smiles at the appreciative
faces in the crowd Camden can’t stand to watch anymore and
exits

The lingering smile on Taren’s face slowly dissipates as he
becomes nothing but a dot in the distance

FADE OUT

THE END
