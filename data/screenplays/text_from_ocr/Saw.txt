The soft sound of moving water can be heard in the

From the top of the screen a tiny floating light moves
downwards across the screen As it passes we see just
the water part of a young man’s face His eyes are
light disappears and across the darkness appears the
AW The title fades away

The tiny light appears again this time floating down
end of a tub of water just near someone’s bare foot
cuts again to the face of the young man underwater
Suddenly his eyes fly open and he comes to life

mouth and gasping for air As he wakes up and struggles
the bathtub we see his foot catch on a drain plug

it The water starts to drain and we see go with the
tiny light which we can also see has some kind of key
to it The room itself is pitch black but we can still
barely make him out in the dark Adam lifts himself out
tub and falls onto the floor coughing and gasping from
He manages to get to his feet but as he moves forward
that his ankle is chained to something He feels his

that is attached to it He cries out his voice

ADAM

Help Someone help me (He stops when

he hears a loud dragging sound somewhere

in the room He looks out into the darkness
and calls out) Is someone there Hey

(He turns back to the corner to which

he is chained says in a slightly softer
but still panicked voice) Shit I’m
probably dead

from out within the darkness comes a man’s

startles Adam The voice we will soon learn

to LAWRENCE

LAWRENCE
You’re not dead

Adam quickly turns in the direction of the voice

arms out for balance he tries to look across the room

is speaking but still cannot see a thing

ADAM
Who’s that Who’s that

LAWRENCE
(his voice strangely a bit on the calm
side and almost irritated with Adam’s
reaction to the situation This shall
be his tone for many scenes to come)
There’s no point in yelling I already
tried it

ADAM
Turn on the lights

LAWRENCE
Would if I could

ADAM

the wall)

With a loud click and an even louder buzzing sound the
bright fluorescent lights come to life lighting up in
starting from Lawrence’s end and moving towards Adam
come on Adam is nearly blinded by the sudden change
black to bright white and squints in pain holding up
to cover his face In the light we now see that he is
mid-twenties with short brown hair wearing a dark
shirt over a white tee shirt and jeans looking like a
rat from the tub It takes him a moment but his eyes
start to adjust and he looks around the room He and
Lawrence who also winces from the glare of the lights
by the light switch and the door He is on the opposite
the room also chained to a pipe in the corner by his
wears a blue button-down dress shirt now soaked with
He is middle aged mid to late forties with pale

and even paler skin Dark circles are under his eyes
are barefoot

Lawrence’s eyes adjust to the light and he sees across
Then his gaze starts towards the center of the room
Adam’s who steps forward as much as he can a look of
on his face We see lying face down the body of a man
clad in

blown his brains out lying in a pool of blood

are heard as the camera moves up and in a fast 360°
and circling the man ending in a full overhead view of

The shot cuts to Adam who reels in shock and disgust

ADAM
Holy shit

He turns towards the tub and leans over gagging and
Lawrence in the meantime hops forward the best he can
the body with a look of fear and concern Adam stops
and turns back around takes another look at the body
the room He looks down at his chain then starts to
freak out grabbing and pulling at his chain

ADAM
(screaming) HELP (He falls back onto
his bottom on the floor as he yanks
at the chain as hard as he can) HELP
Help
Lawrence just stands and watches him with an almost
appalled look at his behaviour It seems that Lawrence
being in the situation he’s in is above that kind of
reaction

He speaks a bit coldly

LAWRENCE
No one can hear you

Adam stops pulling at the chain stands up and looks to
his breathing fast and heavy His voice is not yelling

but still just as hysterical

ADAM
What the fuck is this
against

chains

the metal

I’m stuck

body

not look

LAWRENCE
Calm down just calm down (He knows
that to remain calm is to remain in
control something he must be no matter
what the situation) Are you hurt

Adam looks down at himself shrugging slightly

ADAM
I don’t knowyeah

Lawrence moves over to the pipe in the corner leaning
it for support

LAWRENCE
(calmly) What’s your name

ADAM
(sarcastic) My name is Very Fucking
Confused (demanding) What’s your name
What’s going on here

LAWRENCE

(internal eye roll he’s getting more

and more aggravated with Adam’s behaviour)

My name is Lawrence Gordon I’m a doctor

I just woke up here just like you

(He reaches up wipes his face with

his sleeve)
Adam kneels back down facing the pipe pulling at his
once more but not with his prior panic He winces at

biting into his skin

ADAM
(in pain) Ah

Lawrence looks at Adam with a look that seems to say
in here with THIS guy He then glances down at the
LAWRENCE
Recognize him

Adam continues to pull at his chains does not and will
at the body just shakes his head

ADAM
(sharply) No

LAWRENCE
(trying to get SOMETHING out of this
kid) Well do you have any idea how
you got here

ADAM
No

LAWRENCE
What’s the last thing you remember

ADAM
Nothing (he sits back onto the floor
stops pulling at his chains for a moment)
I went to bed in my shithole apartment
and woke up in an actual shithole (He
raises his left leg slightly starts
trying to pull his foot out of the iron
cuff He glances to Lawrence who has
moved over to the wall to his left
bent over slightly and resting a hand
against a pipe) So what about you
huh

LAWRENCE

(He shrugs slightly shaking his head)
Well there’sthere’s not much to tell
really (Across the room Adam gives

up with the chain for the time being
but remains sitting on the floor) I
was on my way home from work and uh

I don’t remember anything else

Adam just sits there glancing over to the body and
then focusing

on it much more The initial panic has worn off for
now replaced

simply with fear and shock His voice is a bit softer

ADAM
First dead body I’ve ever seen Look
different in real life They don’t move

Lawrence slowly lowers himself into a sitting position
against
the wall He pokes slightly at the iron cuff around his
foot

LAWRENCE
From the looks of these chains someone
didn’t want us to go very far either

Suddenly Adam leaps up lifting up his shirt and
exposing his

abdomen His panic is back but not at full force like
before

He studies himself then glances to Lawrence

ADAM
Can you see any scars

LAWRENCE
(looking at him strangely) What

ADAM
Huh This is what they do man (he gestures
to his stomach where there are in fact
no scars) They kidnap you and drug
you and before you know it you’re in
a bathtub and your kidneys are on eBay
(A ridiculous theory to us and to Lawrence
but Adam states it with conviction)

LAWRENCE
(a scoffing tone in his voice) No one
has taken your kidneys

ADAM
(disbelief) How can you tell from way
over there

LAWRENCE
(matter of fact) Because you’d either
be in terrible agony or you’d be dead
by now Trust me

ADAM
What are you a surgeon (He lowers
his shirt and turns and bends down to
prod at the chain around the pipe again)

LAWRENCE
Yeah (He sighs He’s getting tired
of Adam already He speaks sharply)
So you gonna tell me your name or
what

Adam stands back up turns to Lawrence his voice once
again
calm

ADAM
Adam

LAWRENCE
(getting to his feet his voice a bit
calmer) Well Adam what we need to do
(he leans with one hand outstretched
against the pipe to his right Adam
watches him scared but calm) is start
thinking about why we’re here Whoever
brought us there could’ve killed us
by now But they didn’t They must want
something from us (He looks up and
around the room) Question is what (He
sees something up on the wall moves
forwards a bit towards it We see that
it is a brand new clock on the wall
ticking away It reads currently at
1022) That clock

ADAM
What about it

LAWRENCE
It’s brand new (squints studying it)

ADAM
(not getting what he’s implying) So

LAWRENCE
(sighs it’s quite simple why can’t
Adam see it) So someone obviously
wanted us to know the time (Adam looks
a bit confused still mulls over that
information Lawrence thinks for a moment)
Wait I think I may be able to reach
that door

Lawrence moves over as far as the chain will allow him
to the

giant wooden sliding door pushing against it as hard
as he
then reaches
nothing in
a plastic
baggie the

wondering what

glances

Adam holding
micro
written on
Lawrence

see what

through
with LAWRENCE

Adam’s

can In the meantime we see Adam thinking He pauses

down and starts going through his pockets There is

the front two but in his back left pocket he pulls out

baggie with a white envelope in it He unfolds the

envelope says ADAM He stares at it in his hands

it is

Lawrence continues struggling with the door quickly

over his shoulder to see what Adam is doing He sees

the baggie Adam reaches into the envelope pulls out a

cassette tape A close up shows the words Play Me

the tape label Adam holds it in his hand studying it

turns away from the door looking over and trying to

Adam has in his hand

LAWRENCE
What is that (Adam doesn’t answer
continues looking at the tape Lawrence’s
voice grows impatient) Excuse me

ADAM
(glances up briefly at Lawrence then
back down at the tape His voice sounds
slightly surprised) It’s a tape

LAWRENCE
Where did you find it

ADAM
It was in my pocket

Lawrence thinks about that briefly then starts digging

his own pockets finds within them a white envelope

written across it in the same black lettering as

ADAM
(regarding his tape) It says Play me

Lawrence tears into his envelope empties the contents

into the

palm of his hand First he holds up a similar tape to
Adam’s

It also says Play Me Then he holds up a single bullet
studying

it not sure what it’s there for yet Then he holds up
a tiny

key He bends over gets down on the floor and starts
to try

to unlock his chains with the key It doesn’t seem to
be working

LAWRENCE
(frustrated mumbling to himself and
to the key) Come on come on come on

ADAM
(seeing that it doesn’t seem to be working
on Lawrence’s lock) Throw it over here

Lawrence gives him a slightly mistrustful look but

then holds

up the key and throws it Adam misses the key at first
as it

hit’s the floor in front of the dirty toilet near his
corner

ADAM
Fuck (He leans over and picks up the
key then bends down and tries the key
on the lock on his ankle which doesn’t
work He tries the lock on the chains
around the pipe It isn’t working there
either)

LAWRENCE
(watching him) No

Adam gives up drops the key onto the floor
frustratedly shaking

his head That’s when he looks over to the body again
and the

shot closes up on the hand holding the tape recorder A
small
loop handle juts out of the hand’s grip Adam stands

up then

bends down and picks up the tape on the floor looking
at it

He puts it back down then stretches himself flat out on
the floor

trying to reach Unfortunately there is still a good
three to

four feet between him and the body

LAWRENCE
Use your shirt

ADAM
(gets back up to his knees) What

LAWRENCE
Your shirt

Adam looks down at himself then takes off the long
sleeved blue

shirt He lays back down holding the shirt by the ends
of each

sleeve and throws it trying to catch it on the tape
recorder

It misses He tries a second time same result

LAWRENCE
Come on

Adam tries again it misses It is just barely
reaching He pulls
the shirt back gets back up on his knees aggravated

ADAM
It won’t work

LAWRENCE
(trying to get him to not give up yet)
Well look around there must be something
else you can use

ADAM
(stands ready to give up skeptical)
There’s nothing

LAWRENCE

(insistent) Well there must be something

Adam looks around his area then into the bathtub He
sees something
to a long

He kneels

loop at

he gets
relief Adam
along the
plug and
tape

out a

tilted so

male voice

bends over takes out the tub plug which is attached

cord He ties the cord around the sleeve of his shirt
down

holding out the shirt aiming

LAWRENCE

Come on you can do it

Adam throws it attempting to get the plug through the

the end of the tape recorder He misses

LAWRENCE

Come on come on again

He tries again and misses On the third try however
the plug right through the loop Lawrence smiles in
very slowly pulls it back dragging the tape recorder
floor towards him He picks it up getting rid of the
dropping it and the shirt on the floor He picks up the

pops it in and presses play holding the tape recorder

bit so that they can both hear but keeping his head

he can hear better A chilling deep raspy sinister

The Jigsaw Killer comes from the tape As it speaks

Adam’s expression

detected

is fearful but the thought How does he know can be

JIGSAW
(on tape) Rise and shine Adam You’re
probably wondering where you are I’1l
tell you where you might be You might
be in the room that you die in Up until
now you simply sat in the shadows
watching others live out their lives
But what do voyeurs see when they look
into the mirror Now I see you as a
strange mix of someone angry and yet
apathetic But mostly just pathetic
So are you going to watch yourself die
today Adam Or do something about it
(end)
Adam looks frightened but not sure of the entire
meaning of the
message

ADAM
I don’t get it (He presses the stop
button on the tape)

LAWRENCE
(eagerly gestures) Throw me the player

ADAM
(pauses thinks) No you throw me your
tape

LAWRENCE

(a heavy sigh He looks at Adam as a
slow-minded fool who simply doesn’t
understand the full capacity of the
situation that they’re in and speaks
to him as such) Look we’re going to
have to work together if we want to
get out of here Now just throw it to
me

ADAM
(picks up on the tone speaks defensively)
I’m not going to risk breaking it You
throw me your tape

Lawrence pauses looking at Adam as though he’d like to
smack

him then holds up and tosses the tape It hits the
floor behind

Adam who kneels down and picks it up pops it in
presses play

It’s the same chilling voice as on Adam’s tape As the
tape plays

Adam stares at Lawrence and Lawrence at the tape
recorder

JIGSAW
(on tape) Dr Gordon this is your wake
up call Every day of your working life
you have given people the news that
they are going to die soon Now you
will be the cause of death Your aim
in this game is to kill Adam (Adam
glances down at the tape recorder wide-eyed
then back up at Lawrence) You have until
six on the clock to do it There’ sa

man in the room with you When there’s
that much poison in your blood (another
view of the body from Lawrence’s POV)

the only thing left to do is shoot yourself
(Jigsaw coughs) There are ways to win

this hidden all around you Just remember
X marks the spot for the treasure If

you do not kill Adam by 600 then Alison
and Diana will die Dr Gordon And

I’1l leave you in this room to rot

Let the game begin (end)

The looks on each man’s face clearly say Oh Shit The
tape ends
Lawrence stands up

LAWRENCE
(firmly) Give me that Now (Adam tosses
him the tape He catches it rewinds
plays back Adam stands up from his
spot on the floor)

JIGSAW
(on tape)then Alison and Diana will
die Dr Gordon And I’11l leave you
in this room to rot

ADAM
(thinking trying to figure this out)
Any idea who that is

JIGSAW
(on tape) Let the game begin

ADAM
He knows us

LAWRENCE
Wait a minute (rewinds more)

ADAM
(false hope) What do you think Probably
a joke right

LAWRENCE
Shh shh (presses play)

JIGSAW
(on tape) Let the game begin
else

in brown

resting his

shit

to be kidding

then reaches

LAWRENCE
(softly) Listen

JIGSAW
(on tape in a VERY hushed tone after
a brief silence)Follow your heart

Lawrence stops the tape

ADAM
What the hell does Follow your heart
mean

Lawrence is looking around on the walls and everywhere
in the bathroom for a heart He spots a small one drawn
on the toilet next to Adam and points

LAWRENCE
There Right next to you on the toilet

Adam looks sees the toilet Slowly he bends down
hands on the seat looking down into the bowl of liquid
not really sure what he’s looking for

LAWRENCE
(impatient gesturing) Come on come
on

Adam glances up at Lawrence with a look of You’ve got
me but Lawrence watches him expectantly Adam sighs
in with his right hand fishing around in the mess

ADAM
Oh man (he gasps making gagging sounds
his face turned away from the bowl
He coughs fishes around for another
brief moment then quickly pulls back
trying to shake some of the shit off
of his hand spitting

LAWRENCE
(expectantly) Anything

ADAM
seat The
out something

Lawrence

hacksaws
his chain

chain

carefully

(disgusted) No solids
LAWRENCE

Take off the lid (He points to the

lid Adam looks to it slowly stands

up reaches for it Lawrence has no

patience) Come on
Adam takes off the lid places it down on the toilet
water is clearer inside and he reaches in and pulls

wrapped up in a black garbage bag He holds it up for

to see turns to him

ADAM
I really wish I had checked in there
first

LAWRENCE

Huh (he smiles slightly) What is it

Adam tears into the bag reaches in and pulls out two
He drops the bag on the floor bends down and takes up
holding one of the hacksaws and beginning to saw at the
with it Lawrence watches him for a moment
LAWRENCE

Hey (Adam turns and looks Lawrence

speaks in an irritated voice) Mind passing

me the other one

Adam reaches over and picks up the other hacksaw then

throws it across the room It hits the pipe to

Lawrence’s left

on the
preoccupied
garbage bag
away at

progress

Lawrence reaches down and picks it up then sits down
floor Quick shot back to Adam who while Lawrence is
with picking up the hacksaw quickly picks up the

and tosses it into the bathtub Both men start to saw

their chains furiously but neither are making any
Suddenly Adam’s saw snaps in the middle and his
temper flares

ADAM
(enraged) Fuck Fuck (He reacts violently
hitting the broken saw twice against
the iron pipe then turns and hums it
across the room right into a mirror
A small piece of the mirror breaks off
and flies to the floor)

Lawrence glances over at what Adam has done then goes
back to
sawing for another moment Adam sits back down
breathing heavily
leaning against the pipe in his corner Finally
Lawrence gives
up turning and sitting with his back against the pipe

also

breathing heavily for a moment He sits there when a
Look of

realization comes across his face He holds up the saw
Looking

at it understanding He lowers it to the floor
shaking his
head slightly

LAWRENCE
(everything is becoming more clear now)
He doesn’t want us to cut through our
chains He wants us to cut through our
feet (Adam looks up at him eyebrows
raised) I think I may know who’s done
this to us

ADAM
What did you say (he stands up is
Lawrence hiding something from him)

LAWRENCE
It’s not someone I know personally
It’sjust someone I know of
ADAM

(getting slightly frantic again) Jesus
Christ Tell me who is it

his height

the screen is fading into a flashback of a crime scene
speaks his face fades and the flashback scene grows
until it is only the crime scene with three detectives
down a flight of stairs
LAWRENCE
The last I heardthe police still
hadn’t caught him
We now see the three figures descending through a trap
a flight of stairs The lighting is a bright lime green
is strangely dark at the same time The trio enters a
cell like room with a low ceiling They are TAPP SING
Tapp is a tall black man in his late forties-early
is an Asian man in his mid to late thirties and Kerry
woman in her mid to late thirties with long curly
that is tied back in a ponytail All are well dressed
Tapp in suits the woman in a jacket and dress slacks
the detectives working on this case
As they move into the room Sing sees something that
look of shock to his face shining a flashlight on it
see it yet
LAWRENCE
(VO) And the only reason I know that
is because I was a suspect
Tapp comes into the room last ducking slightly from
and comes up alongside Sing looking at the same thing
LAWRENCE

(VO) I’1l start from the beginning

KERRY
This one’s not fresh anymore At least
three weeks out (Detective Tapp squints
as he peers in and studies the body)
Victim’s a 46-year old male (Quick
flash of a crime scene photo a closeup
of behind the man’s head and upper back
There are deep cuts all over The camera
cuts upwards to the detectives) Died
of massive blood loss Mostly through
the femoral artery (The camera pans
around to Detective Tapp who moves
around the side fo the cage to get a
better look inside shining his flashlight
in) He started at the back of the cage
and tunneled his way through the razor
wire so fast it’s amazing he got as

far as he did Cut himself so deep

we found traces of stomach acid on the
floor (Another more gruesome crime
scene photo shot of the body from the
side we can see the razor wire digging
in under his arm Also a close-up shot
of some of his wounds long deep cuts)
We also found this (She holds up an
evidence baggie with a micro cassette
tape recorder just like the one Adam
and Lawrence found in their cell She
presses the play button and Tapp and
Sing listen It’s the same chilling
voice from Adam and Lawrence’s tapes)

JIGSAW
(on tape) Hello Paul You are a perfectly
healthy sane middle-class male Yet
last month you ran a straight razor
across your wrists Did you cut yourself
because you truly wanted to die or
did you just want some attention Tonight
you’ll show me The irony is that if
you want to die you just have to stay
here you are But if you want to live
ou’ll have to cut yourself again (Flashback
hot of Paul waking up in the cage
ooking around scared and confused
he shots go back and forth between
he detectives and the Paul flashback
ith him grabbing and shaking the razor
ire screaming His screams sound distant
nder Jigsaw’s voice) Find the path
hrough the razor wire to the door
But hurry At 300 that door will lock

tote tHerus and

and then this room becomes your tomb
How much blood will you shed to stay
alive Paul (end)

KERRY
(stopping the tape) The door was on
a timer It was unlocked until 300
Then it slammed shut He was given two
hours

Cut back to Detective Tapp who notices something and
shines

his light on it We see a strange wound on Paul’s body
a piece

of flesh carved out into the shape of a jigsaw piece

TAPP
Jigsaw piece (Sing looks in as well
see it There is a quick flash of crime
scene photos showing a close up of the
wound Tapp sighs) I think we’re gonna
be here for a while Sing (Sing looks
to him We get another quick crime scene
shot of Paul)

LAWRENCE
(VO) The newspapers started calling
him the Jigsaw Killer

Cut back to Lawrence in the bathroom For his next two
spoken

lines the shot switches back and forth between him and
the detectives

in the razor wire room

LAWRENCE
Actually technically speaking he’s
not really a murderer He never killed
anyone

Sing wearing gloves gets in the cage and examines
Paul’s body

a bit A flash of another crime scene photo of the
wound with

a ruler held up to it is shown More gruesome crime
scene photos

of that and other wounds are flashed across the screen

LAWRENCE
(VO) He finds ways for his victims to
kill themselves
Cut to Sing kneeled down over a charred corpse
completely blackened

at another crime scene We hear Jigsaw’s voice from a
tape recorder

play over the scene as the detectives look around and
over the

flashback shots

JIGSAW
(VO on tape) Hello Mark If you’re
so sick then why do I have so many
photos of you up and about (there is
a quick montage of a camera snapping
several black and white shots of Mark
up and about looking around and getting
into a car) Let’s put your so-called
illness to the test (Flashback image
of Mark waking up He is a younger man
in his mid to late twenties with dark
brown hair He is completely nude smeared
in some kind of Vaseline-like ointment
In front of him is a small square glass
plate held up by some chains On the
plate is a micro cassette player a
lit votive candle and a box of matches
He gets up looking around confusedly
and scared) Right now there is a slow-

acting
poison in your veins The antidote is

in the safe (Black and white crime
scene shot of the safe then a shot

of Mark standing over it screaming

his screams distant under Jigsaw’s voice
as with Paul) The combination to the
safe (quick montage of several black

and white crime-scene photos of numbers
written all over the walls) is written
on the wall Hurry up and program it

in But watch your step (Mark’s bare
foot steps on the broken glass scattered
all across the floor) And by the way
that’s a flammable substance smeared

on your body (shot of Mark looking at
the ointment on his hand up his arm
everywhere) so I would be careful with
that candle if I were you

MARK
(huddled over the safe screams but
it is still distant sounding) Help

JIGSAW
(VO ct’d)or all the people you’ve
burned with your act (Mark starts to
turn the lock on the safe) just might
have their revenge

We see Mark desperately going around the room holding
looking at the walls trying to find a combination The
goes back and forth a few times in a sped-up shot to
this and turning a the lock on the safe trying to
combination into the safe He moves in a circle

us When he gets to facing right in front of us the
the candle flares up and engulfs the shot flaring into
crime scene photo of Mark’s charred face

The shot moves back to the trio of detectives with

the tape recorder

KERRY
I found something else Well two things
actually (She moves past them and we
go with her over to a wall where there
is a small hole cut about an inch or
two in diameter The light from the
outside shines in) There was someone
standing outside here watching through
this peephole Looks like our friend
Jigsaw likes to book himself front row
seats to his own sick little games
He was there at the last one as well
(She walks over to Sing and Tapp) Only
this time he left us his penlight
(She holds up the penlight in an evidence
baggie clicking it twice then handing
it to Tapp)

TAPP
(taking the baggie studying it) Get
a rush on the prints (He hands it back
to her)

room) Copy that

going over the patient’s charts He
goes over to the x-ray display pushing
the light on to view two x-rays of someone’s
skull He points to it with his pen
as he speaks

LAWRENCE

Okay This patient has an inoperable
frontal lobe tumor extending across

the midline Started as colon cancer

(He turns back to the three young medical
students One of them a pretty Asian

girl named CARLA smiles at Lawrence

as he speaks seems particularly infatuated
with him) The patient has come in for

a standard checkup by which we are able

to monitor the rate at which his condition
is declining

In the doorway an orderly pushing a cart of cleaning
is passing by and stops when he sees Lawrence and the
students in the room listening to what Lawrence is

is Zep He’s a man in his early to late forties dressed
whites with short brown hair and large blue eyes that
kindness that the others in the room seem to be

and speaks of him there is caring in
his voice something Dr Gordon has
yet to display regarding this patient)
He’s a very interesting person

Lawrence looks almost slightly embarrassed not for
maybe for Zep A condescending smug smile plays across
and he nods His tone matches his look

LAWRENCE
hank you for that information Zep
he looks to the students who all share
is smug smile) As you can see our
rderlies form very special bonds with
he patients (Zep just stares at Lawrence
is expression mostly blank but with
ure loathing just underneath the surface
he look seems to say Fuck you Dr
ordon He stares at him for a moment
hen turns away and continues down
he hall with his cart) Continuing
on the patient

tatQHovurytoyenyH

But he is cut off by a voice on the intercom

INTERCOM
Dr Gordon Dr Lawrence Gordon please
page the operator

LAWRENCE

(a smug but annoyed smirk) Obviously

someone doesn’t want me to tell you

what the patient has Excuse me (He

steps around the students leaves the

room The three students watch after

him with great admiration)
Cut to Lawrence’s office at the hospital Inside Tapp
against Dr Gordon’s chair studying the various framed
on the wall Sing is sitting in one of the two chairs
from the desk twisted around in his seat to look at a

of small picture frames on the bookshelf behind him

opens the door and enters and the two detectives turn
at him He removes his white coat and hangs it ona
rack by the

door Tapp speaks first his tone is friendly but
searching

TAPP
Dr Gordon I’m Detective Tapp this
is Detective Sing City Homicide (he
gestures to the degrees on the wall)
Very impressive

Lawrence smiles pretending to care about what they
think truly

just wanting to get this over with so as to not waste
any more

of his time As he speaks he walks over to the chair

behind
his desk
LAWRENCE
Oh Thank you I do my best (He sits
in his chair Tapp takes the seat next
to Sing across from him Sing studies
him silently chewing gum)
TAPP
Sorry to interrupt you while you’re
working
LAWRENCE
That’s fine Now how can I help you
gentlemen
Tapp’s tone turns a bit more serious but still amiable
enough

TAPP

Are you able to tell us where you were
between the hours of 1100 pm and
100 am last night Doctor

LAWRENCE
(his tone just barely masking his concern)
Why is it that you’re interested

TAPP
We’d like to ask you a few questions
about it For your sake I think it’s
best if we do it down at the station
for Dr

it up
be quickly
detectives

them

Lawrence

jacket

Would you like to follow us there

LAWRENCE
(Shaking his head this is unbelievable)
No I’m afraid that’sthat’s quite
out of the question I can’t just leave
I have work to do Plus my wife has
the car today so

SING
(amiable but hinting that he knows something)
Oh that’s okay you can ride with us
Doc

LAWRENCE
(chuckles uncomfortably) I’m sorry
you’ll have to tell me again What is
this all about
Tapp produces the penlight from his pocket holds it up

Gordon

TAPP
Is this yours Doctor

He puts the penlight down on the desk Lawrence picks
a brief oh shit look flashing across his face only to
covered up He looks at the pen strangely The two

carefully study his reaction Lawrence looks back up at

Cut to the Police Station In an interrogation room
paces back and forth nervously now wearing his suit
His lawyer sits at the table taking notes

LAWYER
So you have no idea how your penlight
showed up at the murder scene

LAWRENCE
Of course not

LAWYER
I have to ask What were you doing last
night

LAWRENCE
(a slight hesitation a bit of guilt
in his voice As much as he would allow)
I was seeing someone

LAWYER
(a slight pause) Who (Lawrence doesn’t
answer just continues his pacing The
lawyer gets frustrated noisily puts
down his pen) Look if you can’t be
honest with me

LAWRENCE
(His tone quick almost blurting) I
was visiting someone It wasn’t a patient
Alright (He sighs shakes his head
He’s fucked either way) What am I
gonna do

LAWYER
Well as your lawyer and your friend
my advice to you is to bite the bullet
and give them your alibi now Because
no one is going to believe you later

Cut back to the Bathroom Lawrence still sitting
against the

wall throws down his hacksaw next to him resting his
hand against

his knee

LAWRENCE
(sighs) That was five months ago He
tried to set me up for murder

Cut back to the Interrogation room some time Later
Lawrence

is sitting alone at the table Sing comes through the
door shuts

it behind him

SING
Okay We checked your alibi It holds
up (His voice indicates that he still
believes there’s more to it he does
not and will not trust Lawrence)

LAWRENCE
Good Can I go home now

SING
(continuing) We have one of the victims
who managed to escape (As he speaks
we see a young woman with brown hair
in a ponytail wearing a visitors pass
being led carefully into the room next
to them and sat at a table This is
AMANDA Lawrence and Sing can see her
clearly she cannot see them) Want
to know if you wouldn’t mind sticking
around and listening to her testimony
Maybe it’1l trigger something (Tapp
and an unidentified bald black man in
a suit enter the room The man guides
Amanda into her chair stands behind
her against the wall Tapp sits ina
chair to her left)

LAWRENCE
(doesn’t really care) I’d like to help
really but

SING
(cutting him off quickly won’t let
him out of this that easily) Well we’d
really appreciate it She’s the only
one who made it

LAWRENCE
(quietly giving in) Okay

Camera moves into the Interrogation room with Amanda

Tapp and

the unidentified man As Tapp speaks the camera slowly
moves

closer over his shoulder and towards Amanda As we get
closer

to her we see long strange scar-like markings along
each side

of her mouth She is shaken her eyes distant never
looking

anyone including Tapp in the eye It is clear that
her mind

is still lost somewhere within her nightmare

TAPP
(speaking slowly gently) Amandain
your own time tell me the first thing
you remember
We move closer and closer to Amanda then suddenly the
camera

spins round quickly and snaps into an alternate view of
her

her flashback The room she is in has the same lime-
green lighting

as Paul’s cell Amanda sits in a chair wearing a
strange iron

contraption around her head a bear-trap like device
covering

her mouth We can see her eyes surrounded with black
eyeliner

as they slowly open groggy just waking up

AMANDA
(VO) I woke up All I could taste was
blood (The camera moves back quickly
and we see her tied to the chair her
wrists bound to the arms of the chair
She pulls against her bonds moaning
loudly trying to speak or cry out but
cannot) And metal

She continues to struggle against her bonds some more
The camera

circles around her and we get a better view of the
strange device

on her head and the padlock and timer on the back of
it A long

wire hangs down from the timer and below the screen

The view switches to the side of her and we see next to
her an

old television set which suddenly switches on
startling her

After a brief moment of static the frightening image
of a demented

clown-like doll its face white with red spirals on its

cheeks

its red eyes leering at Amanda from the screen She
stares at

it her moans a bit softer to match her fear and utter
confusion

The doll speaks the jaw moving it is the voice of
Jigsaw

JIGSAW
(from the TV) Hello Amanda You don’t
know me but I know you I want to play
a game Here’s what happens if you lose
(The video moves next to the doll to
device The
camera
later SNAP
explodes

back to

off Amanda
and the

her movements

it begins
head pulling
it is stuck

as she

a device like the one she’s wearing

attached to a mannequin head As he
continues explaining what it is her
breathing grows faster and heavier

and her moans pick up more) The device
you’re wearing is hooked into your upper

and lower jaws When the timer at the

back goes off your mouth will be permanently
ripped open Think of it like a reverse

bear trap Here I’11 show you

The video pans back to a view of the doll and the

doll’s head moves and looks down at the device and the

zooms in on it A timer ticks away A few seconds
The device springs and the fake head is crushed and

Amanda shrieks her eyes widening The video switches

a close up of the doll

JIGSAW
(from the TV) There is only one key
to open the device It’s in the stomach
of your dead cellmate Look around
Amanda Know that I’m not lying You
better hurry up Live or die Make your
choice

The video goes to white and gray static then switches

begins to struggle like a madwoman against her bonds
chair The camera swings around her circling making
fast and jerky Amanda manages to pull one arm free
other and stands up quickly That’s when the cord in
She

of the device is pulled out and the timer starts

her eyes widening We see a close-up of the timer and

its sixty second countdown She reaches behind her

at the lock and the timer trying to pull it off but

there She starts freaking out pulling at it as much
can the camera movements once again fast and jerky
around her

The camera spins back to Amanda sitting still in her
chair in

the interrogation room sniffling We see a brief shot
of Lawrence

who watches and listens to her with grim amazement
Back to Amanda

AMANDA
And then I saw the body

We switch back into Amanda’s cell Over her shoulder
we see

near the corner the body of a man lying on the floor on
his back

Amanda cautiously approaches it the timer still
ticking away

her hands still at the device She kneels down
cautiously next

to him She reaches down and with a shaking hand lifts
up his

shirt revealing a large black question mark drawn on
his abdomen

She sobs harder hunched over him

Quick cut to the interrogation room Amanda in the
center of

the shot

AMANDA
There was a knife

Back to the cell Amanda still leaning over picks up

a small

knife next to the body She slowly brings it up in both
of her

shaking hands clutching it She looks closer at it A
quick

shot of the timer shows it to be at 25 seconds now
almost halfway
The camera moves to a shot of the man’s face when

HE OPENS HIS EYES AND STARTS TO WAKE UP He moans
unable to

speak or move His eyes slowly groggily look around a
bit He

cannot even open his mouth someone has very heavily

him He sees Amanda over him with a knife and his eyes
he tries to moan at her to stop to not do what she’s
do but she turns the knife upside down in both hands
stabs down He moans in agony in the background as she

down again and again and again Blood splashes on her

A quick shot back of Lawrence as he listens his mouth
eyes wide staring at her Cut back to Amanda in the
she stabs down a few more times Then back again to the
in Lawrence’s interrogation room Sing throws down an
baggie with a used syringe in it
SING
(VO as camera pans up to Lawrence) He’d

been injected with an opiate overdose
He couldn’t move or feel much of anything

LAWRENCE
You meanhe was alive

SING
(staring nods slightly) Was

Back to Amanda’s Interrogation room her head still
sniffling A view of Tapp as he asks
TAPP

What happened after you took it off
Cut back to the cell her bloody hands sifting through
for a key Cut back to interrogation room Amanda then

Amanda’ s hand pulls a small key from inside the organ

the first

back and forth
Suddenly from another corner of the room a light comes
the puppet from the video in the corner Amanda sees
at it wide eyed her sobs softening for a moment as she
at it Slowly it wheels towards her on a tricycle She
stare and cry not sure what to do or expect It stops
at her then speaks
JIGSAW

Congratulations You are still alive

Most people are so ungrateful to be

alive But not you Not anymore
Cut back into a close up of Amanda in the interrogation

her head still shaking a bit almost like a series of

spasms She continues to sniffle her eyes far off Cut

TAPP
You are in fact a drug addict Isn’t
that right Mandy (she nods but doesn’t
look up) Do you think that is why he
picked you (She lets out a sob briefly
nodding once) Are you grateful Mandy

She finally raises her head looking into his eyes for

time
AMANDA
(softly) Hehelped me

As she starts sniffling and breathing more heavily

Tapp looks

over his shoulder into Lawrence’s room right in his
direction

He may not see him but he knows he’s there The camera
then

cuts back to Amanda who starts sobbing more heavily
again Slowly

the camera moves down into and under the table fading
back into

an overhead view of the bathroom where Lawrence and
Adam are

Adam sits in his corner staring down at the floor as
he has

been listening to Lawrence’s story He looks up across
to Lawrence

ADAM
(softly) Are you sure it’s him

LAWRENCE
(nods slightly) Yeah I’m sure

ADAM
(becoming a little hysterical again
He speaks accusingly) How do I know
you’re telling the truth You can be
the one who put me in this room (he
gesticulates as he speaks pointing
to Lawrence and himself)

LAWRENCE
(internal eye roll speaks slowly as
to a simpleton) I’m in exactly the same
situation you’re in

ADAM
Wrong (he stands up kicking his chained
foot out Shouts) Wrong You’ve got
one thing I don’t Information (He
hovers as close as he can in a threatening
pose pointing) You know who did this
(He picks up a glass shard that fell
when he broke the mirror holds it up
threateningly to Lawrence) Now you either
tell me what is really going on (Lawrence
rolls his eyes turns his head over

to his left away from Adam) or I’ll

cut you with this you hear me I’1ll

cut- (But he stops short as he sees
something in the glass He flips it

over studying it flips it back He
looks over to the mirror on the wall
studying it thinking)

Lawrence notices that Adam’s ranting has ended glances

over
at him
LAWRENCE
What
ADAM
(looks over at Lawrence then back at
the mirror) It’s a two-way mirror
Adam drops the shard down on the floor carefully then
reaches
over to the corner behind him leaning down and picking
up a
loose padlock He lifts it up and throws it as hard as
he can

against the mirror shattering most of the glass
Lawrence briefly

startles at the sound and force of the glass
shattering Adam

reaches back down finds another piece of debris and
throws that

at the mirror with just as much force The rest of the

glass

breaks away and a camera with a red light can bee seen
behind

a clear glass Lawrence stands up to get a better look
at it

We movie in closer to the camera getting a better look
at it

as well

Suddenly there is a flash of static and we find
ourselves looking

at a fuzzy black and white surveillance video of
Lawrence and

Adam in the bathroom staring right at us into the
camera The

shot pulls back a bit and we see that the video is on a
silver
recording-type
man’s
on the

leather glove

into regular
to the

dripping with

surveillance monitor A partial view of other

equipment can be seen on either side of the monitor A
voice speaks though it doesn’t sound quite the same as
Jigsaw tapes As he speaks a hand wearing a black
raises up slightly and waves its fingers at the screen

MAN
(OS Taunting) I can see you

ADAM
(from on video) So that’s what this
is Reality TV

MAN
(OS Still taunting sounds as though
on a power trip) Don’t look at me I
can’t help you

The shot transitions from the video view of Adam back
view in the bathroom Adam stands in a threatening pose
camera speaks angrily loudly to it his voice
sarcasm

ADAM
Can you hear me in there Huh I’m having
a blast (he bends down and picks up
another piece of debris from the floor)
This is the most fun I’ve had without
lubricant (Hums the piece of debris
at the window It makes a thwacking
sound but doesn’t break Not even a
crack) Make sure you’re getting everything
(Bends down throws picks up and throws
another piece of debris It hits but
no breakage Leans down for another
piece)

LAWRENCE
(Scoffing tone as he watches Adam trying
to break the glass) That’s not going
to do anything

ADAM
(pauses looks to Lawrence) You just
want to leave it running on us (the
Lawrence’s
he is
Lawrence is

accusingly

shot switches to surveillance view)

LAWRENCE
(very matter-of-fact) Well you won’t
stop it (shot switches to regular view)
That’s why we can’t cut through these
chains It’s why you won’t break that
glass (he gestures to the pipe then
the glass) Every possible angle has
been pre-thought out by him (He appears
deep in thought starting to understand
the set-up more so figuring out the
way this guy thinks Almost admiring
him The situation may be bad but it’s
a brilliant design)

ADAM
You sound like you admire this prick

LAWRENCE
(explaining) To overcome something
you have to understand what a perfect
engine it is That’s how you fight disease
(He looks up at the ceiling at the
walls around the room) Now the tape
told us to find an X That X has to
be somewhere in this room (determined)
Help me find it

Adam does not help him look He simply cannot believe
calm demeanor in this situation anymore It seems that
almost becoming as sick of Lawrence’s attitude as

of his He speaks a with a bit of a hyper tone again

ADAM
How can you be the calm Doctor Guy when
your wife and kid are out there (Shot
of Lawrence looking around the room)
He’s got them too (Shot of the clock
it’s now 1205) He could be doing anything
to them right now Are you thinking
about that

LAWRENCE

angrily) I AM thinking about that (Adam
backs off a bit Lawrence pauses a moment
his voice changes to calm but sad)

I’ve been the last thing I said to my
daughter

Lawrence turns away from Adam placing his hand on the

him and the shot moves up into blackness then up at
of a little girl’s bed in a darkened bedroom The
is Diana She’s about 5 or 6 years old with long wavy

brown hair She lays tucked in with her eyes closed

teddy bear wrapped in her left arm The camera moves up
her a bit moving in closer to her Chimes can be heard
very faintly against a soft breeze As the shot pauses

her her eyes suddenly open blinking away sleepiness

up pulling away the covers still holding her teddy

remains sitting in her bed staring over into the dark
to her right The chimes jingle away We move in closer
face something has her spooked A clock ticking is
heard as the image fades from Diana getting out of bed
strange mechanical-looking clock on the living room
the Gordon Household

The shot lowers and we see the nicely furnished living
the Gordon home the

The walls are a dark crimson red

in tones of red and brown It definitely is the living
a well-off family Not too cold but not as warm and
it could be Diana slowly makes her way across the

towards her parents bedroom moving almost dream-like

bear hanging limply from her right hand She moves to
both into

her side

with long
pretty despite
moves into
just watching
feeling of
awoken her

her daughter

her hand

glass double doors of her parents room opening them

the bedroom where we see her mother Alison laying on

fast asleep Alison is in her early to mid thirties

blond hair going just past her shoulders and very

her sleepiness and messy hair in this scene Diana

the room standing next to the bed saying nothing

her mother sleeping Alison’s eyes slowly open the

being watched plus the instincts of a mother have

She reaches over and turns on the light
with concern

ALISON

looking upon

Diana Honey are you okay (she pushes
back the covers and gets up crouching

down in front of her daughter

Looking

up at her she places her hands on her

daughter’s arms) Diana Honey

DIANA

(very softly but showing almost no

fear) Mommy

Alison reaches up and touches Diana’s hair bringing

down in a soft caress on Diana’s cheek

ALISON
Oh what is it sweet pea

DIANA

(very calmly) There’s a man in my room

ALISON
(sighing but not rudely This

is not

the first time this has happened) Oh
Honey are you sure he’s not just hiding

in your imagination

DIANA
He talked to me
ALISON
(sighs) Okay I’ll come and check your
room (She smiles a small assuring
smile)

DIANA
I want Daddy He’1l get the scary man

ALISON
(her smile fading a bit) Alright if
you want Come on

She stands and leads Diana out of the room Cut to
Lawrence’s

office Lawrence sits hunched slightly over his laptop
computer

focused on some paper he’s writing Diana and Alison
appear in

the doorway to his left He doesn’t even look up just
keeps

typing Alison’s tone when she speaks indicates that
she knows

he’1l probably say no or put it off on her

ALISON
Larry sorry to bother you but your
daughter had a bad dream again

LAWRENCE
(his eyes never leaving the screen
raises his finger to pause them) Just
a minute

ALISON
She wants you to check her room

LAWRENCE
(keeps typing never looks up) Mmm hmm
mmm hmm just gotta finish this paragraph

Alison waits a moment then turns to Diana

ALISON
(softly) You know what sweetie I’11
go check with you

They turn slowly start to walk away as Lawrence
quickly finishes
typing then closes the laptop
the lamp

propped up

on the

takes it

LAWRENCE
Nope I’m done (he smiles turning
to look at them)

Cut to Diana’s room Lawrence reaches over and turns on

on Diana’s side table Diana lies in bed slightly

against her pillows and stuffed animals Lawrence sits

side of her bed

Just then

LAWRENCE
(very reassuringly) See (he pulls the
covers up over her up to her chest)
There’s no one in your room There’s
no such thing as the bad man Now can
you go to sleep

DIANA
I’m still scared

LAWRENCE
You are Give me your tootsie (He pulls
back the covers and she pulls out her
foot He takes it in his hand) Oh

he following) This little piggy went

at him) Let’s see Try and get some

nods he reaches up and gently brushes
her hair away from her face) No no

DIANA

LAWRENCE

He moves his face closer to her and together they say

LAWRENCE and DIANA

LAWRENCE
That’s right that’s right (He gives
her a kiss pulls back) Good night

DIANA
Good night Daddy

Lawrence gets up and goes to the door flipping the
lights off
He pauses before he steps out

LAWRENCE
Tomorrow I’ll read you your favourite
story

DIANA

(with a small smile) Okay
Lawrence

voice starts

LAWRENCE
Okay (he goes out)

Quick cut to the Entrance Hall of the Gordon Residence
walks towards the door Alison behind him Alison’s

to cut over the scene Her tone is very pissed off

ALISON
I don’t know how much longer I can do
this Larry

LAWRENCE
(sounds as though he has no idea what
she means) What what are you talking
about

ALISON
(pissed in disbelief) How can you walk
through life pretending that you’re
happy

LAWRENCE
I am happy

ALISON
(confrontational) That is complete bullshit
(cut to a shot of Diana laying on her
side in her darkened room clutching
her teddy bear to her chest Her eyes
are open she can hear everything We
stay with her for the rest of Alison’s
line her voice now off a bit in the
distance but still very audible) I’d
rather you break down and tell me that
you hated me At least there’d be some
passion in it

LAWRENCE
Would you like to see her (He reaches
into his pocket and takes out his wallet
throws it across the room to Adam who
is sitting with his back against the
wall facing Lawrence Adam picks up
the wallet and opens it He sees two
pictures of Diana side by side The
one on the left is Diana hugging a dog
The one on the right is a smiling portrait
outside somewhere
face is
Cut to
Lawrence
gagged
to it

reads

ADAM
She’s beautiful

LAWRENCE
Thank you

ADAM
(sighs then looks up at Lawrence) You
gonna have any more kids

LAWRENCE
(a bit wearily but not snobby) We’ve
talked about it but uh with our schedules
it’s difficult enough to concentrate
on one (The tone of his voice indicates
that maybe he’s starting to realize
that he should’ve spent more time and
attention to his daughter)

ADAM
(referring to the wallet) So where’s
the lucky wife (a small smile)

LAWRENCE

here’s another picture behind the one
ou’re looking at (Adam reaches behind
he photo on the right and pulls another
hotograph out Lawrence smiles slightly
s he speaks) It’s my favourite one
ecause we’re all in it together Someone
sually me has to hold the camera

hich means I’m always missing from

he photos

tecona Ud 4H

Cut to Adam looking at the picture he pulled out His
blank but you can sense great disturbance behind it
a shot of the photo he is holding It is not the one
described but a Polaroid of Alison and Diana bound and
and the message Regards with a jigsaw piece drawn next
He turns the photo over and there is a message As he
it Jigsaw reads it aloud in a voiceover

JIGSAW

(VO) X Marks the spot Sometimes you
see more with your eyes shut
to Lawrence

continues to

from

the earlier

with them

Adam does his best to hide what he has seen looks up

ADAM
It’s uh it’s not here

LAWRENCE
(a slight disturbance from his momentary
nostalgic bliss) What

ADAM
Uh this photo you’re talking aboutit’s
not here

LAWRENCE

(slightly surprised reaching out his
hand for Adam to toss the wallet) Really
Are you sure

ADAM
Yeah (Tucking the picture in his right
hand he shifts slightly by lifting
himself a bit with his right hand sneakily
putting the photograph down and tossing
the wallet with his left hand Lawrence
picks up the wallet and starts looking
for it creasing his brow in concern
while Adam backs up against his wall
holding the photograph out of Lawrence’s
sight against a pipe he rests his arm
on as he looks at the photograph)

LAWRENCE
(disbelief shaking his head) Hehe
must’ve taken it I
Alison’s voice over is heard as he says this and
look through the wallet and we hear Alison’s voiceover
the scene in the main hall
ALISON
(VO) How can you walk through life pretending
that you’re happy

CUT TO the Main Hall of the Gordon Residence back to

flashback of Lawrence and Alison This time we stay
turns away

to the
slightly

towards her

LAWRENCE
I am happy (He walks over to a chair
leaning over it as he puts something
down gets his briefcase ready to go
to work Alison stands a few feet behind
him trying her best to get him to react
to stop the bullshit and end the masquerade)

ALISON
(pissed) That is complete bullshit
I’d rather you break down and tell me
that you hated me At least there’d
be some passion in it

LAWRENCE
(tired of this brushing it off as not
that important like there really is
nothing wrong) We can talk about this
alter okay (He leans in to kiss her
but she shakes her head He pauses there)

ALISON
(firmly) Just leave
He looks at her for a moment searching then slowly
and heads out the door
VOICE
Goodnight little girl (camera pans
up closer into the closet and we a
widened blue eye and part of a face
(yet unidentifiable) watching her)
The closet doors burst open and Diana screams Cut back
main hall where Alison stands alone her head lowered
As soon as she hears the scream she turns and bolts

daughter’s room

ALISON

He pulls away the gun and the stethoscope tucking the

teddy bear As he does we catch a brief glimpse of the
half of his face but not enough for a clear
yet
He holds the teddy bear out in front of Diana for a
tucks it in front of her He pats her on the head and
up moving over to the window He parts the curtains
and leans forward a bit and we see his face more
is Zep the orderly from the hospital
Cut to static and then a surveillance video view of

of the Gordon home of the window where Zep is

camera zooms in on him and we hear a raspy male voice

VOICE
(VO as we view shot of Zep) Who are
you little manI see you (cut to

a television screen with the video of
Zep in the window Fade back and to

the right as we get a view of someone’s
apartment Plastered on the walls are
various photographs which we can barely
make out and a desk in the corner with
some recording equipment As we move
further right and hit the window we

see Detective Tapp leaning over the
camera shooting the Gordon’s window
adjusting the view Something about

him seems just not right We cut back
to his view from the camera) Does Dr
Gordon know you’re at home with his
wife I know you know something (his
voice goes up a bit louder) What are
you doing in there Waiting for the
doctor I’m waiting for the doctor
too Hmm
Cut to a view over Tapp’s couch of the television with
Zep on

video on the screen Tapp walks over and sits down in
front of

the television his back to us

TAPP
I never should have let you go

Camera pans up to a wall of articles all about the
Jigsaw killings

It moves quickly and zooms in on each headline we see
Jigsaw

shot of

Paul in his cage first struggling against the wire
then hanging

dead in his cage Killer ‘Preaching’ Says Top Cop

flashback

footage of Amanda in the interrogation room then
fighting with

her mask and a shot of Lawrence watching and listening

to her

Lawyer It

ends on the flashback shot of Tapp looking back at
Lawrence through

the two-way glass after Amanda tells her story and the
shot

slides into a shot of a car pulling up alongside a
building

TAPP
(VO fading hushed against soundtrack)
I never should’ve let you go

The car pulls up alongside a building with Lawrence in
the passenger

seat and Tapp driving Lawrence’s awkwardness Tapp’s
distrust
and general uncomfortable tension can be easily

detected between

moment

We are
obsessively
in hand

television

detectives

them

LAWRENCE
(Pretending like he’s trying to be helpful
really just glad to be out of Tapp’s
company) Here we are That was uh quite
an amazing story that poor woman told
(Tapp just nods says nothing Lawrence
smiles very uncomfortably gets out
of the car)

LAWRENCE
(leaning down and looking back into
the car window) Look I’m sorry I can’t
be of more help to your investigation

TAPP
(nods very slightly) You know we arrested
a dentist last week who like to play
with kids a bit too much He lived two
blocks from here The sewer lines run
under this neighborhood too Doctor
(hint hint)

Lawrence stands straight up walks away Tapp wait’s a
then drives off

BAM into static and then the video from Amanda’s cell

not at Tapp’s desk in the police station watching him
watch the video staring at the screen remote control
As he watches the camera circles around behind the
to give us a better view of our obsessed detective

JIGSAW
(from the video) Hello Amanda You don’t
know me but I know you I want to play
a game Here’s what happens if you lose
There’s a timer at the back of the device
you’re wearing When the timer goes
off your mouth will be permanently
ripped open

In the background of the station we hear a couple of
own desk

and rewinds

then the
paying
speaks The

his growing

scene

while he

talking then Sing walks in behind Tapp over to his
He turns watching Tapp watch the screen Tapp stops
the tape

SING
(to the other detectives leaving) I’1l
catch you guys down there (he reaches
over and gets something off of his desk)

JIGSAW
(from video) Think of it like a reverse
bear trap

Tapp fast forwards a bit hits play

JIGSAW
(from video) I’1l show you

Tapp watches closely the demonstration of the timer
device going off and exploding Sing watches too not
as close attention As soon as it explodes Sing

look on his face and the tone of his voice indicates
concern for his partner’s obsession over this case

SING
Hey Tapp

Tapp doesn’t look up resembles Lawrence in the earlier
when Alison and Diana came to him to check her room
was working on his paper

TAPP
Mmm

SING
We’re gonna go down to the Grill go
get a beer You wanna come

TAPP
I don’t think so Thanks anyway

SING
(Figured he might answer as such) You
know I always ask (He puts on his jacket)

JIGSAW
(on video) There is only one key

SING
I’1l leave you to have fun up here
(He puts his hands on his hips watching

some more of the video)

JIGSAW
(on video) It’s in the stomach of your

dead cellmate

SING
(still trying to reach him break him
from his obsession groove) Hey Tapp
I don’t mean for this to be

disrespectful (pause)
Maybe you should find yourself a girlfriend

Sing chuckles hits Tapp playfully on the arm tapp

laughs a
bit too but doesn’t look up Sing remains grinning a

bit But
then Tapp continues and rewinds the video a bit

JIGSAW
(on video) It’s in the stomach of your

dead cellmate

Tapp fast forwards

JIGSAW
(on video) Look around Amanda Know
that I’m not lying (Sing steps off
to the right) You better hurry up (Tapp
rewinds again suddenly pauses)

TAPP
Wait wait wait Sing
Sing stops turns

TAPP
Get back here

SING
What
TAPP
Mmm (he gestures franticly for him
to come over)

SING
(sighs then comes over) What

Tapp rewinds one second then pauses holds pencil to
the screen
to a grafittied wall on the video

TAPP
Remember 118th Street

SING
(looks at the screen thinks a minute)
AhK2K That gang’s territory was
only about four blocks

TAPP
Now listen to this

They listen with the volume up high Over the static
the sound

of a fire alarm can just barely be heard in the
background They

look at each other Tapp hits stop

TAPP
(looking up at Sing) We gotta check
the records from all the fire emergencies
that occurred there in the last two
weeks Go right now Mmm

Sing turns and quickly walks off

CcuT TO
Close up of a map with Sing speaking
in a voiceover As he speaks there’s
a brief shot of the two of them sitting
over the map then quick shots of a
few black and white photographs of a
warehouse including a close up of a
street sign Stygian St

SING
(VO) On the night of Tuesday the 17th
we got a fire alarm going off in the
rear wing of 213 Stygian Street It’s

SING
(are you serious) Right now

TAPP
Why not

SING

Yeah why not (He grabs his gun snaps

a cartridge into it grabsup his coat

and quickly follows Tapp
Brief shot of K2K graffiti on the video and then loud
which snaps into an exterior nighttime view of an old
building and a car speeding by Our view is from inside
as it pulls up alongside the building A police radio

heard in the background So can the sound of a gun

and cocked

TAPP
(VO) At least we’1ll have the cover of
darkness

SING

(VO) Yeah well so will anybody else

A shot of inside the factory various clutter and

up on one another No signs of lifeyet A bang from
of the door is heard A couple more bangs and a shot of

Tapp in front Sing covering behind them They come up

level one that has been recently used we see as Tapp

over to a desk with a computer a radio and some other

items Then right next to the desk we see the K2K

from the video

TAPP
I got you
They continue on moving into a room separated with a

fence There is a slightly raised platform going along

of the wall with a few steps leading up on either
goes up the steps On the raised area are some tables
in heavy red cloth Tapp points to one reaches down
back the covering He reveals a small diorama of the
scene where Adam and Lawrence dolls complete with the

dolls representing each of them

TAPP
What the hell is this (his voice
almost a whisper) Oh shit
They move onto the next table and Tapp pulls back the

covering that one revealing the leering Puppet from

video Tapp stares at it wide-eyed Next to the puppet

boar-like mask with long dark hair The camera pans

have the view of another large object covered in red
Tapp and Sing had passed by Tapp leans in closer to
the puppet when suddenly the still-covered form starts

and muffled moaning sounds are heard It startles the
SING
Oh fuck

They both go over and stand on either side of it
taking one

end of the red cloth whipping it off Underneath is a
man tied

to a chair with duct tape over his mouth held in place
by a

manacle around his neck A contraption on the chair
holds two

power drills about six inches from either side of his
head pointed

directly at his temples His eyes wide he moans
through his

tape at the detectives

Suddenly a door is heard clanging open on the other
side of

the building and the detectives spin to face the
sound guns

ready

TAPP
(looks to Sing says softly) Wait Sing

SING
(trying to keep his voice low but coming
off a bit loudly) What

TAPP
(eager) Let’s see what he’s gonna do
SING

Why We’ve fucking got him

Tapp however having studied this guy for so long
wants to get

a good look at him before he’s captured see him in his
element

TAPP
We don’t know what he looks like Let’s
see what he’s gonna do

SING
(rather loudly again) No fucking way

As the two argue the man in the chair continues to

position

TAPP
Sing Sing (he moves in front of the
man a bit holding up his hand to try
to halt Sing trying to convince him
to go along with him)

SING
(isn’t buying into it)
gonna take him

Fuck that I’m

TAPP
Sing

SING
What the fuck Shit

TAPP

Wait Sing listen

Whoever it is is moving closer so they quickly cover

man and the other things they uncovered The man in the

protests loudly through his gag and struggles as much

in his chair Sing and Tapp go and hide behind a tarp

the entryway to another room while a figure in a black

in red comes up on the elevator The elevator stops

figure moves forward slowly and carefully He goes up

to the man in the chair The figure’s hood is up we do

his face As he walks he seems like he might be having
difficult time with it

He reaches and uncovers the man who begs in muffled
the gag When the figure speaks we instantly know it

it is the unmistakable voice from the tapes and the
JIGSAW
Awake already Jeff I need more powerful
tranquilizers next time (Jeff continues
his cries sheds a few tears Jigsaw
reaches over and touches his shoulder)
Don’t cry I’ve given your life a purpose
You’re a test subject for something
greater than yourself

That’s when Sing cocks the shotgun and the two
detectives move

out of their hiding spot aiming their weapons at

Jigsaw
SING
Freeze Police
TAPP
Hold it right there Don’t move
SING
Put your fucking hands in the air
Jigsaw slowly raises his hands starts to turn to face
them but

then quickly steps down hard on a red button on the
floor and

the drill trap on Jeff’s chair comes to life He
remains with

his back mostly to them hands still raised

JIGSAW
Now you’1l make a choice (Sing runs
up the steps to try to where Jigsaw
is gun aimed at him Tapp remains where
he stands) In 20 seconds the life
of this man will be ended

TAPP
Shut up and get down here

SING
(keeping his gun steadily aimed) What
did you do Turn it off

Jeff in the meantime is struggling in his seat as the
drills

come closer

TAPP
Sing stop that thing I’m taking this
bastard down (Sing tosses Tapp the
shotgun) Move

SING
(to Jigsaw) How do you turn it off

TAPP
Tell him how to stop it

Jigsaw backs up a bit towards the stairs

JIGSAW
One key will unlock it

SING
(frantic) Where is it

JIGSAW
It’s in the box

SING
Box (He sees a box on the side of the
chair and opens it Inside he pulls
out a ring of at least 30 keys and
goes over to behind Jeff to try to unlock
the device He tries a couple of keys
none working) Fuck Which key which
key

TAPP
Tell him which key it is

JIGSAW
(now facing Tapp moving closer to him
His back is to us we still don’t see

his face) Time is running out
TAPP

Shut up and get down here right now

asshole

Jigsaw slowly moves down towards him more

JIGSAW
What’s more important to you Officer
arresting me or the life of another
human being

Sing keeps trying various keys Tapp goes up Jigsaw and
grabs
him pushing him down to his knees Jigsaw keeps his
arms slightly
raised

TAPP
Get down on your knees

SING
Jesus Tapp Tapp

TAPP
(gun aimed at the back of Jigsaw’s head)
Hands behind your head (Jigsaw obliges)
Sick bastard

JIGSAW
Yes I am sick Officer

SING
(still trying various keys none working
He’s in a full-fledged panic Jeff closes
his eyes crying as the drills are
only 2 inches away) Tapp It’s like
there’s a hundred keys in here

JIGSAW
Sick from the disease eating away at
me inside Sick of people who don’t
appreciate their blessings Sick of
those who scoff at the suffering of
others

Sing finally whips out his gun and shoots each drill
breaking

and stopping them Tapp glances up at him briefly
distracted

by the gunfire

JIGSAW
(as he pops a blade out of a wristband
hidden up his right sleeve) Sick of
it all (He lashes upwards slashing
Tapp’s throat)

SING
(seeing the throat slash) Tapp (runs
down from Jeff towards them Tapp clutches
his throat completely surprised gurgling)

Jigsaw RUNS fast as he can out of the room Sing

Tapp gurgles at him hands him the shotgun
SING
(standing touching Tapp on the shoulder
then head) I’1l be back okay I’1l
be back
Tapp just kind of nods gurgling and holding his
spins around and then starts chasing Jigsaw through the
out of the room and down a flight of stairs He moves
long misty corridor gun up moving quickly but still
He takes a right goes down another flight of stairs
another right stopping and looking down a short flight
Quick cut to Tapp starting to try to get up holding
He drags himself along the floor
Back to Sing who cocks his shotgun then moves down
very cautiously He takes a left around the corner
facing down another corridor where he sees Jigsaw

get away He takes aim

SING
(shouting) Freeze or I’1ll shoot

Jigsaw continues moving so Sing fires He hits and
down Sing pauses waiting to see if he gets back up
doesn’t move so Sing cocks the gun again and starts to

move forward towards him Cut to a shot of Tapp as he

to his feet and starts towards the stairs to follow

Back to Sing moving further down the hall He gets
down it when we see a shot of his feet just at a trip-
it are some cobwebs hanging down He reaches to part
steps forward into the wire As he steps we see a shot
with wire slowly pulling down on the trigger Sing
and the trigger of that gun and six other shotguns
directly at him fire Sing is hit blood splattering
him and the wall We see only from his shoulders down
for a moment then falls forward to his knees Cut to
is making strange vowel sounds moving down the flight
just before the hallway where Sing now is

On his knees Sing remains upright for a moment
We go to a shot of Jigsaw on the floor Jigsaw starts
and gets himself up to his feet and starts hobbling
down the hall Sing’s body finally falls forward onto

spasming still Tapp continues down the stairs falling

the wall a couple of times We see Jigsaw as he gets to
of the hall and starts sliding a large door open

At that moment Tapp reaches the bottom of the stairs
into the hallway collapsing back into a sitting
the stairs Jigsaw hobbles through the door and starts

left Tapp sits up a bit and looks down the hall where

Sing who has stopped spasming His eyes widening Tapp

the hand from his throat and reaches forward towards
mouth opening and moving but no sound other than some
gasping

coming out The shot fades to a slow-paced black and
white and

then snaps into a few crime scene photos of Sing’s
body including

a nice gory one of the top of his head part of which
is now

missing

At the last photoflash we cut back to a shot of Tapp
presently

sitting on his couch The shot shows a good view of the
scar

across his neck

TAPP
(weak desperate) Had youhad you
on your knees (He sits forward getting
some things off the coffee table) You’re
running You’re running (He gets up
and goes over to the desk in the corner
with the audio recording device and
dozens of photos pinned to the wall
takes a seat) You’re running scared
because we had you I’m going to close
this case Ram close it (He picks up
a small framed photograph which we
can’t see but likely it’s of Sing)
Right Sing Right We’re gonna close
it Sing

LAWRENCE
X Marks the spot(He stands touching
the pipe and looking up and around a
bit) X marks the spotwe need to
search this room again (He turns and
looks over at Adam) What are you doing
over there

Cut back into regular view in the bathroom with a shot
of Adam

sitting on the tub holding the photograph of Alison
and Diana

just beneath the edge of the inside of the tub looking
down

at it He ignores Lawrence flipping the photo over

LAWRENCE
(irritated) Excuse me

ADAM
strikes Adam

reaching over

Lawrence looks

(glancing up calm irritation) Just

because I’m stuck in this room with

you doesn’t mean I have to report to
you every ten seconds

LAWRENCE
(sighs) I really don’t see the point
in us not helping one another

ADAM
well what do you want me to do I’m
on a leash

LAWRENCE
That’s exactly why we need to talk
We need to think

ADAM
I am thinking

LAWRENCE

(snapping at him) Well then don’t keep
me in the dark about what you’re thinking

There is a pause as something about that statement

ADAM
Turn off the lights

LAWRENCE
What

ADAM

(letting the photo fall into the tub
as he stands) Turn them off now please

LAWRENCE
(doesn’t get it) Why

ADAM
(impatiently) Just turn them off for
a second

Lawrence stares at him oddly but moves backwards

and flipping off the lights Adam looks around
think this
him a glow

and shrugs

them wincing
white

picks up
starts

breaks through
out a small
looks to

floor and

floor

around too but he sees nothing He doesn’t seem to
is going to help any Then we see on the wall next to
in the dark X painted on the tiles He doesn’t see it
but Adam spots it

ADAM
Jesus behind you

LAWRENCE
(turns and sees it is surprised) How
come we didn’t see that before
ADAM
The lights in here hadn’t charged it
It must be glow in the dark paint or
something
Lawrence turns and flips the lights back on both of
slightly at the sudden transition from dark to bright
though not as much as before Lawrence leans over and
his hacksaw going over to the tiles where the X is and
hitting the tiles with the handle of the hacksaw He
reaching into a small cavity in the wall and pulling
brown box with a hinged lid He can’t believe it He
Adam a small grin on his face He places it on the

sits down behind it

ADAM
(excitedly) Open it

LAWRENCE
(turns it around so we and Adam can
see the small lock on it) It’s locked
(He pauses thinking then realizes
something) The key the one from my
envelope Where is it

Adam looks around him then leans down looking on the

for the key
ADAM
(soft hushed tone as he looks) Where
the fuckHere (He finds it picks
it up and tosses it over)

Lawrence picks up the key tries it on the lock It
works He

takes the lock off opens the box He holds up a cell
phone

smiling in relief

ADAM
(big smile) Cell phone The most beautiful
invention on this planet

Lawrence takes out and holds up one of two cigarettes
Adam lets

out a joyful laugh

ADAM
Make that second most beautiful invention
(He reaches out his hand for Lawrence
to toss it) Give me that

LAWRENCE
Are you joking You’re gonna put something
we found in this room in your mouth

ADAM
(pause then) Yes I’m willing to risk
it Give me that sweet cancer (Lawrence
ignores his request tosses out the
other cigarette and a lighter He finds
lastly a small folded up note with the
words Shh Doctor written on it) I
don’t care I really don’t Give me
one of those

Jigsaw’s voiceover reads what’s written on the note as
Lawrence

opens the paper and reads it keeping it low in the box
where

Adam can’t see it

JIGSAW
(VO) The cigarettes are harmless I
promise Smoking is only poisonous when
it ends in bloodshed Think about this
- you don’t need a gun to kill Adam
ADAM
(growing impatient) May I please have
a cigarette

LAWRENCE
(ignoring his plea) I’m trying the police
(He flips open and dials on the cell
phone but a weird beeping noise indicating
the call can’t go through comes from
the phone He dials again same result)
Shit (Pause thinks) This was meant
to receive calls not make them (A
moment he realizes something) Wait
a minutethis has happened before

Cut back to an overhead descending view inside a
parking garage

LAWRENCE
(VO) Last night after I finished at
the hospital (fade into another closer
shot of the cars and Lawrence walking
down the corridor carrying his briefcase)
I was walking back to my car (He stops
a moment) I thought I was alone but
I’m sure someone else was there (He
squints bringing his hand up over his
eyes There is a flash from the side
He looks up startled looking in the
direction in which he thinks it came
from but sees nothing He looks around
him for another moment then continues
forward to his car)

Cut to a shot within a circular overhead mirror of
Lawrence’s

car pulling up to an abandoned security gate station
He gets

out of the car shutting the door and going over to a
phone on

the wall to dial security to let him out When he
dials though

it gives him a busy signal As it beeps we cut to
another shot

of his car in the mirror The back door on the
passenger side

starts to slowly open Back to Lawrence who hangs up
the phone

aggravated and reaches into his pocket for his cell
phone He
opens it and dials Back in the mirror we see
something get

out of the car on its hands and knees It is in a red
robe and

has a strangely shaped head with long tangly dark
hair Lawrence

finishes dialing holds the phone to his ear but
receives the

same beeping tone as the phone in the bathroom
indicating that

he cannot make outgoing calls Perplexed he holds up
the phone

trying to get a better signal Alongside the car the
thing moves

even closer now It gets up slowly We see that it is
wearing

the strange boar mask previously seen in the flashback
of Jigsaw’s

workshop It suddenly rushes upon him as he’s
distracted with

his phone and grabs him

Cut back to Lawrence sitting on the floor in the
bathroom still
holding the phone

LAWRENCE
(His eyes distant off in his memory)
Thatthing It was waiting for me
(He exhales sharply then looks back
up at Adam Adam is just standing there
staring at him Something seems a bitoff
With a suspicious tone Lawrence addresses
him) How did you know to turn off the
lights

ADAM
Who cares It worked

LAWRENCE
Yeah but how did you know

ADAM
(a slight pause) Instinct (His tone
is far from believable)

LAWRENCE

(doesn’t believe a word of it) Instinct

ADAM
Yeah
LAWRENCE
You know what (he looks down then
back up at Adam) You’re a terrible

liar

ADAM
(quiet offense) You say that like you
know me

LAWRENCE

(speaks calmly but anger lies underneath
the surface) What else aren’t you telling
me

ADAM

(cocky and sarcastic) Well um let’s

see On my sixth birthday my best friend

at that time Scott Tibbs stabbed me

with a rusty nail I didn’t tell you

about that I didn’t’ tell you that

my last girlfriend (Lawrence lowers

his head into his hands Un-FUCKING-
believable)

who was a feminist vegan punk broke

up with me because she thought I was

too angry Uh I haven’t told you that

one of my toenails is slightly

LAWRENCE
(snaps at him fed up) Just stop it
You knew to turn off these lights

ADAM
(turning away from Lawrence) What-ever

LAWRENCE
(stands up frustrated) I’m dealing
with a juvenile

ADAM
(has had it looks right at him) You
wanna know

LAWRENCE
(exasperated) Yeah

Adam leans down and reaches into the bathtub pulls out
and holds
surveillance

photograph

up the picture of Alison and Diana

ADAM

(with a somewhat aggressive attitude)

Here it is (He throws it towards Lawrence
who looks down at it then back up at

Adam before getting down on the floor

and pulling it towards him with the

hinged box He picks it up sitting

up as he looks upon it with shock )

LAWRENCE
(very softly shakily) Oh God (he
turns it over then back Adam casts
his eyes downwards still standing but
cooling off feeling bad for Lawrence)
Wwhere did you get this

ADAM
(softly) It was in your wallet behind
the photo of your daughter

LAWRENCE
Wwhy didn’t you show me this before

ADAM
I couldn’t (Lawrence begins to shakily
sob touching the photo) I’m sorry
(Adam goes over and sits against a pipe
in his corner lowering his head and
upper body forward holding his head
in his hands)

Lawrence sniffles shaking then looks right to the

camera behind the glass and screams

LAWRENCE
What are you doing to them you bastard
(He goes back to huddling over the

sniffling and crying for a moment Then

he sits up trying to pull himself together)
Okayokay (he looks around a bit)

Okay I’ve got to think now (He looks
down sees the note again in the box)

(VO) Think about thisyou don’t need
a gun to kill Adam When there’s that
much poison in your blood (a slow shot
moving to the pool of blood from the
body in front of Lawrence) the only
thing left to do is shoot yourself

Lawrence looks at the body then down He’s getting an

idea

He takes a cigarette glances over at Adam who still
has his

head down in his hands He dips the end of the
cigarette in the

blood then puts it back in the box He starts to get
up Adam

looks up sees him standing

ADAM
What are you doing

Lawrence goes to the light looks at the camera

suddenly flips
off the lights We see a shot of Zep startling when the

lights
go out on the monitor then we go back to the darkened
bathroom
ADAM
Hey What the hell are you doing
LAWRENCE
(whispering so the surveillance camera
will not pick him up) Adam listen to
me I want you to play along with me
on this
Zep leans in trying to hear what’s being said but the
static
of the video is too loud He tries to adjust the sound
but to

no avail Shot goes back into the bathroom where
Lawrence is
finishing saying something to Adam

LAWRENCE
You got that (he turns the lights back
on both of them again wincing at the
bright light Lawrence glances at the
surveillance camera then looks to Adam
the poisoned

LAWRENCE
(trying to be nonchalant) So you uh
still want that cigarette

ADAM
Umyeah sure

Lawrence makes a show of reaching into the box where

cigarette is but takes the other un-dipped one

instead He throws

Adam just
exhales in
drag then
gurgling sound

it to Adam who reaches down and picks it up from where
Lawrence throws the lighter as well Adam puts the
between his lips and reaches down picking up the
glances over at Lawrence who watches him intently
shrugs then lights up He takes a long drag then
a sigh of relief and with a smile He takes another
suddenly freezes his head jerking and a strange
coming from his throat His head jerks more then the
his body his eyes widening His hand drops the
goes to his throat as he turns still jerky and making
almost squeaky choking sound in his throat The sound
as he falls to his knees then back a bit his left arm
out in front of him dramatically He falls backwards
floor twitching some more still choking He lets out
cough suddenly stops jerking and closes his eyes The
in its entirety is very very fake
LAWRENCE

(watches Adam then turns to the surveillance

camera speaks with angry finality)

There I’ve done it I’ve killed him

with the poison just like you wanted

(shouting) Now where’s my family Where
are they
Suddenly we go to a shot of Adam lying there anda
loud electrical

buzzing sound is heard as his body jerks to life and he
cries

out He spasms and jerks around as he is electrocuted
and Lawrence

looks upon him in shock Finally the electrocution
stops and

Adam sits up slightly gasping eyes wide

ADAM
(he shrieks in pain and shock) Jesus
Christ

Lawrence’s reaction is not one of concern he simply
can’t believe
that Adam just screwed up the plan

LAWRENCE
(disbelief) What

ADAM
(wide eyed) I just got electrocuted

LAWRENCE
What (he rolls his eyes Unbelievable
He speaks in a hushed tone) That was
our way out

Adam looks at him in shock cannot believe Lawrence
would think
he’d make something like that up

ADAM
(yelling at him) Did you hear what I
said (he desperately grabs at the manacle
around his ankle pulling at it and
shrieking) Get this thing off me Get
it off

LAWRENCE
(pissed off) Stop acting

ADAM
(stops pulling at the manacle and chains
now he’s pissed at Lawrence for his
disbelief) You think I would make that
up just to mess up your stupid fucking
charade

LAWRENCE

(gives up on Adam frustrated once more)
All right that’s it (He leans over

and picks up his saw sits down and

starts trying to saw through his chains
again grunting Adam in the meantime
just sits back against the wall breathing
heavily looking dazed Lawrence continues
to franticly saw but it doesn’t work

He gets pissed off and throws the blade
down) Ah Damn it

Back to Adam still looking dazed Suddenly a look of

dawns upon his face The electrocution has jogged his

ADAM
(wide-eyed) I remember everything now
(Lawrence glances over at him) I remember
how I got here

decrepit dingy and old truly a shithole apartment as
it earlier There is graffiti on the door and walls

The camera cuts to a shot of the newest photo through a

the grafittied door of the darkroom before the shot
black industrial music playing over the shot

He takes a few steps forward speaks

ADAM

of him) I can hear you (He takes another
picture the flash lighting up a living
room area Nothing yet He moves forward
more into the kitchen entryway snapping
away for light)

from behind him an EVIL DOLL LAUGH is heard

spinning around

ADAM
(his voice alarmed but confused at the
same time) What the (He snaps a

picture in its direction and sees the
Puppet from Jigsaw’s workshop and video
sitting in an armchair continuing its
evil laugh) Christ (He reaches down
and finds a baseball bat on the floor
and starts hitting the doll as hard

as he can until the laugh starts to
fade and then just dies out ) What

He hears the sound of movement again coming from just

him in a closet He goes on alert again holding up the

bat and the camera

Suddenly

ADAM
Who is that Who’s in there (he moves
towards the door shaking but trying
to be a tough guy) Come on out I’1l
kill you you motherfucker (He opens
the door holds the camera and takes
a picture As soon as the flash goes
off we see the red-robed pig thing that
originally grabbed Lawrence quickly
move forward and grab Adam)

the cell phone rings Lawrence looks down at

slight surprise Adam snaps out of his daze to look at
well Lawrence glances over at Adam and then carefully

reaches

down picks it up and answers it The scene will cut
back and

forth to Diana and Alison in the room and Lawrence on
the phone

for the duration of the conversation

LAWRENCE
(not sure what to expect) Who is this

DIANA
(on the phone sobbing) Daddy

LAWRENCE
Diana (he stands)

DIANA
Daddy is that you (cut to a shot of
her being held by Zep the phone to
her ear)

LAWRENCE
(getting sniffly) Yeah baby it’s me
I’m here (Adam watches him intently)

DIANA
(sobbing) I’m scared Daddy

LAWRENCE
(trying his best to reassure her) Don’t
worry honey everything’s going to be
okay Where’s Mommy

DIANA
She’s here with me

LAWRENCE
(Staying as calm and collected as he
can for his daughter) Let me talk to
her sweetie okay Put Mommy on

DIANA
The bad man from my room is here He
has us tied up and he has a gun

LAWRENCE
Wwhat man

DIANA
Please come home Daddy (Zep kisses
her on the top of her head and takes
the phone away to give to Alison)

LAWRENCE
Hello Hello Diana

Zep pushes some of Alison’s hair behind her ear with
the barrel
of the gun

LAWRENCE
(desperate) Diana Diana

Zep puts the phone up to Alison’s ear

ALISON
Larry

LAWRENCE
Ally Is that you (We see a shot of
Alison giving a threatening look through
her tears to Zep)

ALISON
Is Adam there

LAWRENCE
(surprised looks to Adam who continues
to watch him worriedly) How do you know
Ally what is going on

ALISON
(through her sobs trying to calm them

and get this message to him) Don’t believe
Adam’s lies He knows you He knew all
about you before today (Zep quickly
takes the phone away hangs up Cut
back to the bathroom Lawrence on the
phone)

LAWRENCE
(a dial tone is heard from the other
end hanging up Lawrence is desperate)
Hello Ally Ally (No answer just
the dial tone He stands up) Hello
(He looks to the surveillance camera
screaming) God damn you If you so much
as lay a finger on them I’11 kill you
You hear me You son of a bitch I’11l
kill you (He sits down leaning forward
over the floor crying a bit He slams
his fist fiercely against the floor)

ADAM
(quietly as though cautiously approaching
a dangerous animal) Are they okay

LAWRENCE
(sits up His voice is calmer but rage
is clearly underneath the surface) My
wife she uh she mentioned your name

ADAM
(a brief Oh shit look appears in his
eyes but he acts surprised) What did
she say

LAWRENCE
(not looking at him yet Speaks very
firmly trying to suppress his rage)
She told menot to believe you

ADAM
(cannot even look at Lawrence) Believe
me about what (There is no doubt he’s
hiding something)

LAWRENCE
(Finally turns to look at him the look
of 1000 deaths) She told me you knew
me (He stands looming menacingly
the look stronger on his face) Who are
you

ADAM
(still trying to cover up and losing
still not making eye contact) You know
who I am

LAWRENCE
(snaps shouting at him) Stop the lies
You’re a liar I need to know the truth

ADAM
(His tone changes he’s had it with
hiding had it with Lawrence) I’ma
liar (Finally he looks up right at
Lawrence His voice is firm and accusing)
What did you do last night Lawrence
Work at a hospital Saving sick children
You told me that after you left your
house last night you went to work at

a hospital

LAWRENCE
(defensively) That’s because it’s the
truth

ADAM

(almost deadly) No it’s not Your wife
is right Larry (Lawrence is now the
one wearing the Oh shit look) You don’t
recall getting your picture taken in
that parking lot

Brief flashback shot of Lawrence in the parking garage
pausing

and covering his eyes for a moment when the camera
flashed We

see a shot of Adam holding the camera and taking the
shot from

around a corner ducking back behind the column
Lawrence looks

up at the flash startled

Cut back to the bathroom Adam stands up his stance
and body

language accusing of Lawrence He speaks fiercely
disgusted

with Lawrence’s two-faced bullshit

ADAM
I can prove that you didn’t go anywhere
near a hospital last night (He leans
over and pulls out the garbage bag from
the tub Lawrence stands staring at
him in near disbelief He has been caught
Adam takes a handful of photos from
the baggie he’d kept hidden inside the
garbage bag holds them up and throws
them down scattering them) It’s not
the first time I’ve done it either
Larry (Lawrence leans over to look
at the photos on the floor in front
of him with complete and utter disbelief
picking one up and looking down at it)
I’ve been taking pictures of you for
a few days now (Shots of some of Adam’s
pictures Lawrence going into a building

Lawrence at an outdoor café eating lunch)

LAWRENCE
(still holding the photograph) Butwhy

ADAM
You wanna know what I do I get paid
to take pictures of rich guys like you
who go to seedy out-of-the-way motels
to fuck their secretaries (we start
seeing more shots Adam took while following
Lawrence) Last night I went to your
house (Flashback of Adam holding his
camera then cut to several photographs
of Lawrence leaving his house glancing
over his shoulder and moving down the
sidewalk) I watched you leave I followed
you (Lawrence in the parking garage
photographs of the exterior of the Hotel
Barfly Lawrence inside the hotel knocking
on the door to one of the rooms while
Adam hides around the corner with his
camera) all the way to that shitbag
hotel (Photographs of Lawrence standing
outside then going into the room)

LAWRENCE
(calm with rage just beneath the surface)
You’ve uh had these with you the whole
time

ADAM
I found them in there (points to the
toilet quick flashback of Adam pulling
the bag out of the top of the toilet
then Adam opening the bag and seeing
the hacksaws and a glimpse of something
else in the bag) with the hacksaws
(Flashback of Adam tossing the bag into
the bathtub while Lawrence isn’t looking)
I don’t know how they got there

LAWRENCE
(angry) Yeah right You’re so full
of it (He angrily crumples up and throws
the photo he was holding at Adam)

ADAM
(scoffing tone) Aww face it Larry
we’re both bulls hitters But my camera
isn’t It doesn’t know how to lie It
only shows you what’s put right in front
of it Just out of curiosity what did
you do in that motel room You got out
of there pretty fast

Cut to a flashback the hotel room Carla the pretty
Asian girl

from the hospital is inside the room now in a black
lacy top

and a grayblue skirt waiting for him She opens the
door taking

a step back as he enters He looks unsure of the whole
situation

a changed attitude this evening from all the others He
shuts

the door behind him and Carla smiles at him
Lawrence’s tone

when he speaks is unhappy Not enraged just somewhat
disapproving

LAWRENCE
Why did you um deem it necessary to
page me when you knew I was at home

CARLA
I didn’t know if you were going to make
it (turns goes and sits on the bed)

LAWRENCE
(sounding very business-like) But I
gave you a precise time at which to
page me (He puts the briefcase on a
chair by the door then goes over and
sits down next to her on the bed) You
can’t do that

CARLA
It’s not like I know the rules for this
sort of stuff (She starts unbuttoning
her shirt Lawrence holds out his hand
and stops her She looks up at him
concerned) What’s wrong Dr Gordon

LAWRENCE
(a sigh in his voice) Look it was wrong
for me to makes you come here

CARLA
(confused hurt) But I thought we-

LAWRENCE
-Please (very softly) I’m sorry (He
stands and heads over to the door Carla
remains sitting on the bed She sniffles
slightly but doesn’t cry)

Suddenly the hotel room phone rings Carla and
Lawrence both

look at it unsure startled Carla looks to Lawrence

LAWRENCE
You tell anyone you were here

CARLA
No (She stands goes over to the phone
and answers it) Hello (She listens
turns to Lawrence) It’s for you (She
holds out the phone)

LAWRENCE
For me (He walks over takes the phone)
Hello

The voice on the other end is male slightly raspy It
is unidentifiable

it could be either Tapp or Zep or someone else It is
very accusing

VOICE
I know what you’re doingDoctor

LAWRENCE
I- (but the other person hangs up and
a dial tone is heard)

Lawrence hangs up the phone turns and moves to the
door Carla

moves with him watching waiting for him to say who it
was

LAWRENCE
(nervous) I have to go
CARLA
What happened

LAWRENCE
I’ve got to go (He picks up his briefcase
from the chair and heads out the door

Cut to the underground parking lot the same shot as
where Adam

took Lawrence’s picture He walks along pauses to
wince and

cover his eyes then the flash He looks up startled

The shot cuts back to Lawrence leaning forward against
the wall

in his corner hand against a pipe He slowly looks up
at Adam

thinking of something

LAWRENCE
Who was it

ADAM
Who was what

LAWRENCE
The person who paid you to follow me
who was it

ADAM
(internal shrug) He calls himself Bob
and he gives me the money up front
Two hundred bucks a night If I’d have
known I was gonna end up here I would’ve
asked for a hell of a lot more

LAWRENCE
(pissy) What does that mean Does that
mean you saw what happened to me

ADAM

(internal eye roll speaks as though
he’s been over this 100 times before)
What I saw was you get into your car
That’s it I didn’t ask your name I
didn’t know who you were I don’t know
how I got here I don’t know how you
got here I just took the shots (As

he speaks a quick flashback of Adam
taking a picture going up apartment
stairs then in the darkroom) and went
straight home to develop the Next thing
I know I’m chained to a pipe in some
prehistoric bathroom staring at the

guy I’ve been taking shots of all night

LAWRENCE
(seeing a major break in this mystery)
Clearly whoever paid you to take the
pictures of me is the one who put is
in here

ADAM
(they don’t know that for sure) Maybe

LAWRENCE
Maybe What do you mean maybe Of course
it is What did he look like

ADAM
(internal shrug) I don’t know he was
just a guy (Shot of inside Adam’s apartment
and an unidentifiable figure towards
the back of the room the image darkened
so we can’t make him out The figure
slowly takes a step towards usAdam)

LAWRENCE
Was he tall was he skinny obese what

ADAM
I don’t take notes about his appearance
(Shot inside apartment the figure moves
closer)

LAWRENCE
(aggravated how can he not remember
anything) You must remember something
about him

ADAM
I can’t (Shot of inside the apartment
the figure moves closer)

LAWRENCE
You’re telling me you don’t remember
a thing about the guy
ADAM
I told you I- (inside apartment the
figure moves closer just about close
enough for identification)

LAWRENCE
(enraged throwing his hands up) Oh
for fuck’s sake I give up

ADAM
(gives up his playing dumb tone gives
in due to irritation with Lawrence)
He’s a tall black guy he’s got a scar
around his neck okay (Shot of inside
the apartment the figure moves into
a viewable light It is Tapp)

Lawrence is leaning against the wall facing away from
Adam At

hearing Adam’s description he slowly moves back turns
around

to face Adam

LAWRENCE
Tapp (shot of inside Adam’s apartment
Tapp handing usAdam money Adam’sour
hand reaches out and takes it quickly
Then back to Lawrence) Detective Tapp

ADAM
Whoa the guy who paid me to take these
photos was not a cop

LAWRENCE
No no he was discharged from the police
force (Shot of Tapp at his desk with
the Amanda video looking at notes)
He broke down after his partner was
killed (Tapp and Sing sitting next to
each other in Lawrence’s office) but
that didn’t stop him from harassing
me (Lawrence sitting in the car next
to Tapp) The guy became obsessed (Tapp
in his current apartment adjusting the
camera in the window then a shot of
him leaning over a notebook going over
notes) He’s convinced himself that
I must have somehow been involved with
the murders He’she’s crazy (Tapp
at the corner desk in his apartment
giving a crazy-sounding Heh heh heh
laugh The shot cuts back to Lawrence
who points accusingly at Adam) And
you helped him (disgusted) You took
money from him to invade my privacy
How could you do that

ADAM
(bite me tone) Call it my need to eat

LAWRENCE
(sarcastic) Right right You know what
Adam You’re not a victim of this game
youre a part of it (Points accusingly
at him as he says this)

ADAM
Oh really Obviously this cop thinks
you’re the one behind it all

LAWRENCE
(Facing into the corner of his cell
turning around slightly internal eye
roll) I told you he’s not a cop He’s
a bottom feeder just like you (A slight
sneer from Lawrence at Adam Lawrence
turns back into his corner)

ADAM
(getting REALLY pissed at Lawrence’s
attitude towards him) What are you more
pissed off about The fact that I took
some shots of you or the fact that I
took some shots of you while you were
cheating on your wife

Lawrence spins out of his corner screaming in rage

LAWRENCE
I did not cheat on her

ADAM
What do you care what I think anyway
I don’t give a crap if you covered yourself
in peanut butter and had a 15-hooker
gang bang

A pause then Lawrence collapses onto the floor He’s
lost the

last of any strength level headedness or control he
had before

LAWRENCE
(weakly) How did I get here (Adam sits
down on the pipe in his corner leaning
forward a bit) I hadI had everything
in order (he lays down on his side
facing Adam who watches him with sympathy)
My whole life was in perfect order
(He holds up and looks at the picture
of Alison and Diana gagged)

Cut to the Gordons’ Bedroom Zep puts Alison’s gag back
then leaves the room Alison moves her head around to
the gag then spits it out She tries to fight her sobs
speaks softly to Diana
ALISON

Sweetheart are you okay (Diana shakes

her head no) Mommy just needs you to

be really really really strong right

now I’m not gonna let anybody hurt

you You got that (Diana nods) Okay

that’s my good girl (She starts crying

as her hands work behind her to loosen

the rope around them)
Cut back to Adam in the bathroom looking up slightly
position He glances back down at the photographs on
notices something odd about one of them He furrows his
and gets down on his hands and knees reaching over and
it up leaning back and looking at it studying it
to a shot of Lawrence through the black and white
camera sitting on the floor Adam’s next line is a

over this shot

ADAM
Hey was there someone else at your
house last night besides your wife and
daughter

LAWRENCE
(on camera) No
clock with

moving

She quickly
position
and Zep
eyebrows

ready to

ADAM
(still on camera) Well there’s someone
here (He tosses the photo to Lawrence
whosits up picks it up and looks at
it After a moment the shot cuts back
to a regular view of them in the room)

LAWRENCE
(realization) I know him (We see the
photo as well It is a shot looking
up into Lawrence’s window with Zep
standing there looking out completely
unaware of his picture being taken)
Zep (Cut to a shot of Zep listening
The shot goes back and forth between
him as his eyes widen while Lawrence
makes his threats) His name is Zep
He’s an orderly at my hospital (his
voice becomes a growl furious) Zep
You perverted little psychopath I’m
gonna take great pleasure in seeing
you pay for this You bastard fuck

Suddenly the shot cuts to Adam who looks up at the
a very worried look He points up to it
ADAM
Look (Lawrence momentarily breaks from
his Zep rage looks up The clock reads

at 600) We’re out of time

DIANA
(crying) Mommy help me

Alison continues to untie her Cut to Zep getting up
chair turning to go into the bedroom Alison hears him
near sees his form through the frosted glass doors

to her head and his gun in front of
her chest)

Quick cut to the bathroom where Lawrence is still

the slightly crumpled picture of Zep in the window

rings startling them both Lawrence quickly answers

LAWRENCE

gets up from his corner moves forward
slightly) I know its you you son of

alone in

here He can’t handle this alone He needs his calm

collected

Doctor no matter how badly Lawrence has treated him

ADAM
(crying out close to tears) Lawrence
Get up I need you (He leans down and
finds a piece of debris on the floor
throws it at Lawrence It doesn’t hit
him He leans down picks up another

floor but ricochets and hits Lawrence
who begins to stir A moment and Lawrence
starts to move more reaching for his

in relief) Oh thank God I thought

loudly)

ADAM
(Frightened but trying to stay calm
for Lawrence) Lawrence calm down
There must be a way out of this (It
seems to be a complete role reversal
for the two of them from the beginning
where Adam was the one freaking out
and Lawrence was calm Here Adam is
terrified but still calmer than Lawrence
who has just lost it)

LAWRENCE
(screaming) I can’t be calm My family
needs me No God (He cries and screams
still can’t get the phone He quickly
turns and sits up grabbing the chain
and pulling it as he lets out a terrible
scream of rage Adam’s hands are up
clutching his head trying to keep his
cool but having a very hard time)
