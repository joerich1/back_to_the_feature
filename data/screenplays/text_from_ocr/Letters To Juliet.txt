INT SOPHIA AND VICTORS APARTMENT NEW YORK -- NIGHT

A well-decorated one-bedroom in the Meat Packing District

OPEN ON Long strands of freshly made pasta hung to dry in
the living room Hundreds of pieces Draped off lamps across
tables over chairs everywhere Its an extraordinary sight

Amongst this adornment of noodles we find a beautiful young
woman on the couch working on a laptop trying to
concentrate She seems a bit distracted by the pasta that
surrounds her She is SOPHIA MARCUS

Sophia sighs as she looks up from her computer at the sounds
of cooking that can be heard coming from the

INT KITCHEN WHERE

A man toils over a pot of simmering tomato sauce He is a
handsome Italian-American with big brown eyes He is VICTOR

Victor tastes the sauce hes cooking the way a sommelier
tastes wine Slow and deliberate Hes pleased but subdued

Victor carefully plates some of that fresh pasta with his
sauce and takes it into the living room

Sophia looks stressed out She keeps glancing at what looks
like a draft of a magazine article certain parts have been
highlighted Shes in the middle of typing something when
Victor approaches with the plate of food

VICTOR
Here taste

SOPHIA
OK gimme a second

Victor waits impatiently as Sophia finishes typing She sets
aside the article and dutifully takes a forkful and eats it
Victor watches her closely as she chews tastes swallows

SOPHIA
Delicious Your best yet Really

Sophia reaches for the article just as a piece of pasta slips
off a lamp and falls onto the page She picks it off

Sophias affirmation hasnt convinced Victor he tastes just
the sauce as if trying to pinpoint a flaw

VICTOR
Theres not too much garlic
Sophia looks up from her laptop - a little annoyed

SOPHIA
Just enough garlic

VICTOR
Too spicy

SOPHIA

Good spice
She tries to go back to work Hes still standing there

VICTOR
Maybe it needs more basil

SOPHIA
(exasperated)
Victor Im saying its delicious

VICTOR
Youre saying its delicious but
youre not telling me its
delicious

SOPHTA
Sweetie please I have to finish
this Bobby needs this tonight I
still have to pack could you think
out loud in the kitchen Youre not
doing much for my concentration

Realization flashes in Victors eyes He tastes again

VICTOR
Thats it Its too concentrated

Victor plants a big kiss on a startled Sophia

VICTOR
Thanks babe

Sophia shakes her head and goes back to work as Victor heads
into the kitchen muttering to himself

EXT APARTMENT BUILDING NEW YORK -- MORNING

INT VICTORS RESTAURANT -- DAY

The restaurant is basically a building site Its a fantastic
space but right now itd take an experienced eye to fully
appreciate its potential

Victor is looking at an assortment of light fittings with
MARK his bartender

Sophia walks through the mess with a slightly detached air of
curiosity BUILDERS are at work all around her

Her cell rings She checks the ID Takes a breath Answers
SOPHIA
Hey Bobby

INT MAGAZINE EDITORS OFFICE WHERE

BOBBY BROOKS editor-in-chief a rotund bald but benevolent
looking man is talking on a wireless earpiece in a cluttered
office Hes looking at an 8x10 photograph of Donald Trump

BOBBY
Why cant we say Trumps comb over
wraps around clockwise Im looking
at the picture were running with
the piece Its wrapping clockwise

INTERCUT Sophia has made her way outside the restaurant

SOPHIA
You can say it You just cant
state it as a fact

BOBBY
It works better as a fact Its a
fun little detail People love fun
little details

SOPHIA
I looked at every picture I could
find of him in the last ten years
I talked to his stylist The hair
changes Its a fact if you qualify
with usually or typically

BOBBY
People hate qualifiers

Sophia shrugs as if to say What do you want me to say
SOPHTA
Those are the facts

BOBBY
Yeah well your facts are getting in
the way of my fun

Bobby sets the picture aside A beat

SOPHIA
Hey While I have you I wanted to
talk you about something

Sophia is pacing now Shes visibly nervous - like shes
debating whether or not to just get off the phone

BOBBY
Talk

SOPHIA
Well I was thinking Since Im
going to Italy already Maybe I
could try doing a travel piece or
something as a feature or--

BOBBY
I have writers that do travel
features You dont do travel
features You do fact checking

SOPHIA
Yeah I know I just I was
thinking I could try something new

BOBBY
Why do you want to try something
new Youre good at fact checking
Too good

Bobbys Assistant hurries out to answer a ringing phone

SOPHTA
I feel like I can contribute more--

BOBBY
You contribute plenty My writers
count on you They cant do what
they do unless you do what you do
Youre good at something be happy
for that be grateful for it a lot
of people are good at nothing

SOPHIA
Yeah I guess Its just--
His Assistant signals that Bobby needs to take the call
BOBBY
Keep swinging in your wheelhouse
Youll get more hits
She sighs - deflated Bobby suddenly remembers something
BOBBY
Oh and I need a table at Babbo this
Friday Can you take care of it
SOPHIA
Seriously Bobby You do know that

BOBBY
I do But she doesnt know the
Maitre d You do You got it

SOPHIA

BOBBY
Youre one in a million kid

He rolls to that waiting call

INT CAB -- LATER

Sophia sits staring out the window lost in her thoughts
Victor gets in breathless and excited

VICTOR
Verona here we come

He notices Sophia not sharing his enthusiasm

VICTOR
Whats wrong

Sophia just kind of shakes her head as if to say nothing

VICTOR
Whatd Bobby want

SOPHIA
To argue about which direction
Trumps comb over wraps

VICTOR
Counter clockwise
SOPHTA
He still treats me like Im his
assistant Hell always treat me
like Im his assistant

VICTOR
Its not that bad He values you
Hey youve got job security right
She just looks at him

SOPHIA
Right

Content hes made her feel better Victor dives back into his
Gourmet Magazine They ride in silence Until

SOPHIA
I took the job because I thought
itd be a stepping stone to

features or covers or something
But there are no steps there are
no stones theres just Donald
Trumps hair

She sighs - a sigh thats looking for reassurance

VICTOR
You know you could always come work
with me at the restaurant

SOPHIA
I know And I appreciate it

VICTOR
Youd be great in fine dining

SOPHIA
So Ive been told by you

VICTOR

place if you wanted

She smiles
SOPHIA

VICTOR

He puts an arm around her and pulls her towards him

VICTOR
Come on Cheer up Just forget it
Thats why were going to Italy

SOPHIA

Sophia wants to believe him but still looks skeptical

VICTOR

and Juliet How romantic is that

SOPHIA
Didnt exactly work out for them
though did it

EXT NARROW STREET VERONA -- DAY

A street that embodies true Verona hidden away from the well-
worn tourist routes A small restaurant runs down one side of
the street with tables filled with LOCALS eating lunch

Sophia sits on the balcony of a rented apartment just above
this restaurant Shes reading a guide book to Verona while
occasionally looking down on life in the street below

INT RENTED APARTMENT -- BEDROOM -- LATER

Sophia walks in from the balcony looking at her guide book
just as Victor comes out of the bathroom drying his hair
SOPHTA
So I think we should start with the
Verona Arena then head over to the
Museo Castelvecchio

Victor takes the guide book from her tosses it on the bed
VICTOR
No no no no what are you doing
That stuffs for tourists To
discover the true heart and soul of
any country first you have to
indulge in its smells and tastes

She just looks at him Sometimes hes so full of it

EXT ITALIAN COUNTRYSIDE -- DAY

A small Fiat Cinquecento races down a road that cuts through
the heart of the countryside

INT WINERY -- DAY

Victor tastes a variety of wines with a dashing VITICOLTORE
Sophia is trying to talk with one of the FIELD HANDS who just
brought in a bushel of grapes when she sees Victor by the
wine barrels waving her over with his camera She sighs

INT IN FRONT OF THOSE WINE BARRELS

Victor and the Viticoltore pose with their glasses raised in
toast for Sophia who prepares to take their picture

As her camera flashes we cut to the STILL PHOTO itself

EXT EDGE OF FOREST OUTSIDE VERONA -- DAY

The middle of nowhere The kind of place where the mob buries
bodies Sophia seems acutely aware of this

Sophia and Victor are with a furtive looking MAN dressed in
army camo fatigues Theres a SMALL DOG at his side The man
is holding a cloth covered basket He removes the cloth with
a theatrical flourish to reveal a basket full of truffles

Victor takes one out and smells it Hes awestruck

VICTOR
Wow

Sophia checks her watch Shakes her head
FLASH CUT TO

Victor The Man and Dog posing with the basket of truffles

EXT FARMHOUSE ITALY -- DAY

A rustic farmhouse set in the middle of acres of olives

INT OLIVE PRESS -- LATER

Its dank and dark No electricity No indoor plumbing
Victor sits at the end of long table tasting olive oils with
a gnarled walnut colored OLD MAN There are dozens of
bottles of emerald green olive oil in-front of them

Sophia has wandered to the other side of the room where she
watches WORKERS operating an ancient olive press Something
drips on her from the ceiling

Victor dips a piece of bread in a saucer of oil and tastes
it Hes in seventh heaven He picks up a bottle

VICTOR
This is the one

Sophia is talking with one of the Workers when she sees
Victor waving to her from across the room with that camera

FLASH CUT TO

Victor and his chosen bottle of olive oil posing in front of
the ancient olive press with The Old Man

INT CURING ROOM -- LATER

Victor and Sophia are in a huge ham curing room Its
basically a giant poorly-lit shack full of ham

Theres a row of cured pig heads hanging from hooks Sophia
stares at one of them It stares back This unsettles her

A BUTCHER slices thin pieces of prosciutto for them to taste
Sophia turns down her taste - still staring at the pig head
Victor tastes his chews then closes his eyes

VICTOR
Thats incredible Can you imagine
when people in The City taste this
(MORE)

VICTOR (contd)
I see lines Wait Maybe we should

have a deli next to the restaurant

SOPHIA
Thats actually not a bad idea

VICTOR
I know I know Im on fire

She has a thought Then takes out her cell and steps outside

EXT MANHATTAN WHERE

Bobby is hustling down a congested street Hes walking fast
like hes late for something His cell rings He answers

BOBBY
Bobby Brooks

INTERCUT Sophia just outside the shack of ham on her cell

SOPHIA
What if I did a piece on the food

BOBBY
An expose on how good Italian food
is Bold kid I smell a Pulitzer

SOPHIA
You know the Mediterranean diet is
one of the healthiest in the world
They have the lowest incidences of
coronary disease in Europe because
of all the pulses they eat

Bobby shakes his head - she just doesnt get it

BOBBY
Jesus Sophia I gave you a
vacation Go vacate Get drunk go
to a museum get drunk then go to a
museum

Sophia looks at Victor through the window getting ready to
taste a piece of one of the pig heads She looks nauseous

BOBBY OS

SOPHTA
Wait What if I

Bobby is about to walk into a high rise

BOBBY
Ciao Bella
He hangs up She looks at her cell - disappointed deflated
Then she sees Victor waving her over with his camera through
the window She rolls her eyes and dutifully walks back in
FLASH CUT TO

Victor and The Butcher posing with a huge ham between them

EXT CURING ROOM -- LATER

Sophia and Victor walk back to their car
VICTOR

VICTOR

to get up there before he closes

SOPHIA

VICTOR

He looks at her A disappointed beat

VICTOR
Alright Ill drop you in town

She smiles affectionately at his pouting

VICTOR
Youre missing out though

She kisses him

SOPHTA
I know

EXT OUTDOOR CAFE VERONA -- DAY

Sophia sits at table on the patio by herself sipping coffee
The town bustles around her Shes got her laptop open And a
blank note book open beside that

She stares disdainfully at the blinking cursor on a blank
word document as if willing it to inspire her

She finishes her coffee and looks around at the LOCALS and
TOURISTS chatting laughing shopping

She looks about ready to give up when something catches her
eye through the crowds

A YOUNG GIRL about fourteen years old is sitting on a curb at
the entrance to a courtyard across the street from Sophia

The girl is reading a letter through a flood of tears The
constant stream of PEOPLE passing by on their way in and out
of the courtyard hardly seem to notice her But Sophia has

The Girl looks up from her letter and sees Sophia watching
her She looks back through those tears and the crowds They
look at each other long and hard Sophia smiles The Girl
looks away

The Girls shoulders heave with a great silent sob as she
takes a last look at the letter signs it puts it an
envelope then disappears through the courtyard entrance

Sophia watches her go A beat of consideration Then she
packs up her laptop puts money on the table and leaves

EXT COURTYARD CASA DI GIULIETTA -- VIA CAPELLO VERONA -- DAY

Sophia enters a strange eerily quiet scene This is the
supposed courtyard of Juliet Capulets house Its become a
shrine to TEENAGE GIRLS their conversation is subdued
Theres an atmosphere of almost religious reverence

Sophia walks past a group of girls looking up at The Balcony
Another group gazes upon the Statue of Juliet - her left
breast polished from years of superstitious touching

Sophia finally comes upon the girl from the street so
desperate yet so full of hope Shes standing before a wall
thats covered in envelopes and letters

Some are wedged between bricks others are held in place by
chewing gum but all are addressed to the same name Juliet

Sophia watches as the girl finds a place for her letter She
leaves it and turns to go The girl is wiping away tears as
she passes Sophia on her way out of the courtyard Their eyes
meet

SOPHIA
Are you OK

The girl either doesnt understand her or has no interest in
discussing her problems with a stranger She leaves without a
word Sophia watches her go

BELLA 0S
Her heart is broken

Sophia turns to find a pretty Italian woman in her twenties
who just watched that whole exchange She is BELLA

SOPHIA
Do you know her

Bella shakes her head

SOPHIA
How do you know her hearts broken

Nods to her letter on the wall

BELLA
She wrote to Juliet
SOPHTA
And
BELLA

When your leg is broken you go to
the doctor When your heart is
broken you come to Juliet

Bella approaches the wall Sophia follows her She looks over
the dozens of proclamations of love and longing

SOPHIA
There are so many of them

BELLA
Its like this every day

SOPHIA
Why do they do it

BELLA
They want answers

SOPHIA
That theyll never get

BELLA
Says who

And with that she starts collecting the letters beginning
with the girls from the street

Sophia is startled at this intrusion it doesnt seem right

SOPHIA
Hey Whoa Wait What are you
doing You cant do that

BELLA
Why cant I

SOPHIA
Because its like taking pennies
out of a wishing well or something
these are peoples wishes you
cant just take peoples wishes

BELLA
But then how are we supposed to
give them answers

This throws Sophia She gives Bella an inquiring look

SOPHTA
Whos we

BELLA
Come Ill show you

They walk out of the courtyard and across an alley to a
restaurant Sophia looks up and sees that its called
Lettere a Giulietta

INT LETTERE A GIULIETTA RESTAURANT -- LATER

Bella walks through the restaurant into the kitchen Sophia
follows The kitchen is very busy In the middle of it all is
the head chef ANGELINA a round woman in her sixties with a
no nonsense air about her Shes barking orders at her staff
when Bella and Sophia approach (Italian in Italics)

BELLA
Mama this is Sophia Im just
gonna show her upstairs

Angelina smiles at Sophia Sophia smiles back Angelina looks
at the basket of letters Bella is carrying

ANGELINA
Looks like youll be having a busy
night
Bella nods then turns to Sophia

BELLA
This way

They walk through the kitchen and up some stairs into

INT THE OFFICE OF THE SECRETARIES OF JULIET -- LATER

Its a small modern-looking office just above the restaurant
Big arching windows overlook a courtyard Posters on the wall
show scenes from Romeo and Juliet movies of the past

There are desks and filing cabinets and computers Three
friendly-looking WOMEN look up as Sophia and Bella walk in

BELLA
Ladies this is Sophia

Sophia kind of half waves at the smiling women

BELLA

These are The Secretaries of

Juliet We respond to the letters

she receives from around the world
SOPHIA

You mean you actually write back

To everyone

Bella smiles

BELLA
We give answers

INT THE SECRETARIES OFFICE -- LATER

Bella leads Sophia on a tour of the office

SOPHIA
So How do you decide which of you
answers which letter

BELLA
We all have our areas of expertise

They pass a kindly looking woman in her seventies MARIA

BELLA
Maria has been happily married for
fifty-one years so she tends to
handle mostly marital issues

At the next desk is a bookish woman in her late fifties who
has the air of someone who has seen it all FRANCESCA

BELLA
Francesca made her living as a
nurse so she usually does illness
and caring for the sick

Lastly they approach an diminutive elderly woman reading a
letter and slowly shaking her head DONATELLA

BELLA
Donatella has twelve children
twenty-seven grandchildren and six
great grandchildren
(obviously)
She handles family matters

SOPHIA
And what about you

Bella hesitates to answer The other Women all look up from
their work with big smiles at this question

DONATELLA
Anything to do with love

MARIA
Bella is our romantic

FRANCESCA
Our hopeless romantic

BELLA
At least Im some kind of romantic

Sophia is still trying to get her head around all of it

SOPHIA
So Who pays for all this

BELLA
Were all volunteers We pitch in
what we can when we need to

Bella nods Sophia is blown away

SOPHIA
Wow

Maria walks over with the basket of letters Bella collected

MARTA
Were gonna start reading

Bella notices Sophia looking curiously at the letters

BELLA
Would you like to help

SOPHIA
Oh No I shouldnt I couldnt
Im not much of an expert on love
or romance or

Bella gently places a letter written in English in her hand

BELLA
You just have to read

Sophia takes the letter

CLOSE ON Envelopes being opened with postage marks from all
over the world

A volunteer TRANSLATOR works to transcribe some of the
letters written in foreign dialects

Sophia and The Secretaries sit reading and sorting the days
letters As they read we watch their reactions as we hear
certain portions of those letters read to us by the authors

The VOICES are young and old different accents different
tones but all are drenched in the same sense of longing

ITALIAN GIRL VO
Dear Juliet how do you know when
youre in love Can you know

AUSTRALIAN WOMAN VO
duliet I dont think I want to
marry him but I so want to get
married What should I do

AMERICAN TEEN VO
Is it weird to think sex is
gross I mean cause it kinda is
right Im not like weird for
thinking that am I

Sophia places the teens letter in one of several piles

INT THE SECRETARIES OFFICE -- LATER THAT EVENING

The letters have been read and sorted The Secretaries are
busy composing their responses - all by hand

Sophia sits watching Bella write

SOPHIA
Do you ever worry about being
wrong

BELLA

What do you mean

SOPHIA
Youre giving answers but how do
you know theyre the right answers

Bella considers the question for a beat

BELLA
We dont tell anyone what to do we
just share our experiences we let
them know theyre not alone There
are no wrong right or wrong answers
when you write from your heart

Sophia smiles at that sentiment

INT JUST OUTSIDE A BOARD ROOM IN NEW YORK WHERE

Bobby has excused himself from an editors meeting to take a
call The look on his face tell us he regrets doing so

BOBBY
So people all over the world are
crazy enough to write love letters
and ask the advice of a fictional
teenage suicide and these women
are all crazy enough to write back
under the alias of the very same
fictional teenage suicide is
that pretty much the gist of it

INTERCUT Sophia is on her phone in The Secretaries office
She stutters and stammers - trying to spin it

SOPHIA
Well Yeah No Id probably focus
more on their moving self-less
attempts to spread hope and
answer loves unanswered questions

Bobby considers for a beat - a beat more than usual Before

BOBBY
Its not a feature Theres no
hook Get me a hook then maybe
just maybe Ill let you go
fishing And Sophia

SOPHIA
(hopeful)
Yeah
BOBBY

Next time you call it better be to
find out what kind of wine I like

EXT LETTERE A GIULIETTA RESTAURANT -- PATIO -- THE NEXT DAY

Sophia sits at a table with her laptop open Shes glaring at
that cursor blinking on that blank document

Bella approaches with a huge bowl of pasta topped with
steaming meatballs in a tomato sauce

SOPHTA
I didnt order

BELLA
My mothers meatballs theyre
legendary Just a little thank you
for your help last night

SOPHIA
Little

Victor approaches carrying the Verona guide book smiling

VICTOR
Supplier meetings are officially

Sophia turns to Bella

SOPHIA

The Secretaries I told you about

Bella smiles at Victor but hes not looking at her just now
Hes caught a scent

VICTOR
Whats that smell

He looks at the plate in front of her

SOPHTA
Victor

He picks up her plate and sticks his nose very close to it
and inhales deeply Hes staggered by the aroma

VICTOR
My God

He grabs her fork and tastes He groans with pleasure

BELLA

BELLA
Oregano garlic parsley bread

He shakes his head no then pauses for effect

VICTOR
History Years and years

history Who made this

SOPHTA

VICTOR

Victor goes without waiting for Bella who looks at Sophia
curiously then follows him Sophia is alone at the table

She looks at the meatballs suspiciously then tastes one

SOPHIA
Thats a good meatball

EXT LETTERE A GIULIETTA RESTAURANT -- PATIO -- EVENING

Sophias plate is long since empty She looks at it and then
at her watch She gets up and heads back towards the

INT KITCHEN WHERE

She finds Victor in chefs whites cooking with Angelina He
looks up at Sophia as she walks in

VICTOR
Have you met Angelina
SOPHIA

VICTOR
Shes a genius
SOPHIA
She is
ANGELINA

Hes such a charmer

SOPHIA

He hesitates Victor treads lightly around the following

VICTOR
Yeah sure heres the thing
though Angelinas offered to let
me work a dinner service with her
tonight Shes gonna teach me to
make that marinara Can you imagine
that marinara in Manhattan

Sophia is clearly annoyed

SOPHIA
And what am I supposed to do

Bella steps forward

BELLA
You could always help us

Victor jumps all over this suggestion

VICTOR
Great idea That is a great idea
You write Ill cook Win-win

Sophia just looks at him thinks about arguing then doesnt

EXT COURTYARD CASA DI GIULIETTA -- LATER

Sophia and Bella gather up the days letters in silence
Sophia is clearly still miffed about Victor bailing on her

BELLA
Your Victor is very passionate

SOPHIA
About food My Victor is very
passionate about food

This revelation unsettles Bella she looks like she wants to
say something more but stops herself

They finish collecting and are headed out when Sophia notices
a letter they missed stuck on a remote corner of the wall

SOPHIA
Forgot one

Sophia jogs back to get it when she pulls it from the ancient
wall a large piece of mortar falls at her feet She looks
back at Bella as if to sorry Bella shrugs it off

BELLA
It happens

Sophia picks up the piece of mortar and tries to slide it
back in place when something catches her eye hidden deep
within the newly made crack in the wall It looks like paper

Sophia slides her fingers into the crack She manages to grab
the paper and pull it out She stares in amazement

CLOSE ON An envelope Its old and stained The writing is
quaintly old fashioned in that spidery kind of way

SOPHIA OS - PRELAP
Look at the date
INT SECRETARIES OF JULIET OFFICE -- LATER

BELLA
1951 My God

The Secretaries are gathered around Sophia who is holding an
old handwritten letter

BELLA
What does it say

SOPHIA
I didnt go to him Juliet I
didnt go to Alfonso I was on
holiday with my parents he was a
local boy he picked grapes at a
vineyard It was his eyes I still
remember the first time those eyes
found me My parents would never
approve so we made plans to run
away We were supposed to meet at
that vineyard but when the time
came I couldnt bring myself to
go My parents and I returned to
London the next morning Im so
afraid I fear the only thing
worse than not being with him would
be knowing he doesnt want to be
with me Please tell me what to
do With love Claire Smith

Silence Sophia just stares at the letter affected

BELLA
I think she came back She flew in
the face of her parents and her
friends to find her one true love
And she made sweet love to her
Alfonso for the rest of her life

FRANCESCA
I think she found him They had ten
children Then he got old and bald
and fat and she wonders every day
what happened to that gorgeous
Romeo she left her family for

MARTA
I think she stayed in England where
she married a Duke and lived
happily ever after in his castle

DONATELLA
And Ill bet when shes making love
to that Duke shes imagining her
first love I do that all the time

Everyone laughs except Sophia whos still holding the letter

SOPHTA
Id like to write back

The women all stop laughing and look at her

MARTA

Why Shes probably moved
DONATELLA

Or died
FRANCESCA

Probably moved and died

SOPHIA
Probably But she wanted an answer

Bella smiles at this she gives Sophia a pen and paper

BELLA
So give her one

CUT TO

SHOTS OF The Secretaries quietly going about reading and
replying to that days batch of letters efficiently

They write dozens of different letters throughout the night
But Sophia works only on that one letter to Claire Smith She

chooses each word carefully

INT SECRETARIES OF JULIET OFFICE -- LATER THAT NIGHT

The Secretaries have left for the evening Only Bella and
Sophia remain Bella looks over her shoulder at Sophias
letter - its rather long at this point

BELLA
Lets hope if she gets it she has
some time on her hands

SOPHIA
Too long
BELLA
No
(smiles)

-not for a novella

Bella puts on her coat and heads out the door

BELLA
Lock the door and turn off the
lights when youre done OK

INT SECRETARIES OF JULIET OFFICE -- EVEN LATER THAT NIGHT

Sophia has finally finished the letter Shes addresses the
envelope and puts on a stamp She stretches yawns Theres a
knock at the door Sophia turns to find Victor coming in with
a plate of anti pasti She smiles He smiles back

SOPHIA

He sets down the plate of food and kisses her

VICTOR

SOPHIA

Howd it go with Angelina

VICTOR
It was unreal I thought I was good

Silence as he lets that last sentence just hang there Sophia
realizes what hes asking why he brought her the anti pasti
She stops eating it and just looks at him

SOPHIA
You promised this trip wouldnt
just be about the restaurant

VICTOR
I know I know I did But this is a
chance to learn sixty years of
culinary knowledge in a week Its
a once-in-a-life time opportunity

Sophia sighs
VICTOR

SOPHIA

VICTOR

Victor enjoys himself in the kitchen amongst all the noise
and chaos Hes chopping stirring tasting the guy sweats

VICTOR
No no Ill do it

Victor picks up the bowl makes the sign of the cross then
should barges his way out into the restaurant where

The Secretaries of Juliet are sitting at a long table with
Angelina drinking wine and laughing loudly

Victor proudly places the bowl of meatballs in the middle of
the table and then declares in his best flawed Italian

VICTOR
Ladies I give you my balls

There is a pause before the women burst out laughing

VICTOR
Please help yourselves

MARTA
If were thirty years younger I
would

The women laugh again and start serving them out

FRANCESCA
Attempting Angelinas meatballs
either very brave or very stupid

They all taste them adjudicating as they chew For Victor
this is sheer agony All eyes are on Angelina It seems like
an eternity before she starts to slowly nod her head
approvingly The others follow suit and start clapping

Victor is so overcome that he sweeps Angelina into his arms
and kisses the old woman passionately on the lips Everyone
cheers Angelina is quite flustered and flushed by the kiss

SOPHTA
I remember when he used to have
that effect on me

Bella laughs and stands up tapping her wine glass

BELLA
To our new friends Who leave us
tomorrow as they continue onto
Palermo but will remain in our
hearts To Victor and Sophia

Everyone raises their glass

ALL
To Victor and Sophia

They clink and drink Victor takes in the moment He smiles
at Sophia like someone trying to keep a secret who cant

VICTOR
Sophia

She turns to see him smiling big at her

SOPHIA
What

VICTOR
I want you to be my front of house

SOPHTA
Your what

Victor theatrically drops to one knee - playing to the crowd

VICTOR
(takes her hand)
Will you be my front of house

A beat of confusion

SOPHIA
Is that like code or a metaphor or
something

VICTOR
I want you to run the restaurant

She just stares at him - flabbergasted He stands up

SOPHIA
What about my job

VICTOR
You hate your job

SOPHIA
But I love writing I still want to
write You know that

VICTOR
You always talk about taking a step
forward making a change this is a
change

SOPHIA
I was thinking more like a change
to The New Yorker not Zagats

Silence This isnt going how Victor has envisioned

VICTOR
I want us to do this together It
wont be the same without you

Sophia doesnt know what to say or where to look She just
stares at him speechless Before she can answer a subtly
handsome Englishman enters the restaurant He is CHARLIE

CHARLIE
Excuse me Im sorry to interrupt
but are you the Secretaries of
Juliet

BELLA
You found them

CHARLIE
Great So which one of you wrote
this letter to my grandmother
Claire Smith
Sophia cant believe it How fantastic She steps forward

SOPHTA
I wrote it

CHARLIE
It was a very thoughtful letter

SOPHIA
Thank you

CHARLIE
Now if you wouldnt mind telling me
what the hell you were thinking

A deathly silence This is not what she was expecting

INT LETTERE A GIULIETTA RESTAURANT -- LATER

Sophia and Charlie sit at table removed from the others
Victor is visible in the background serving The Secretaries

SOPHTA
She deserved an answer

CHARLIE
Fifty seven years ago maybe Not
now

SOPHIA
Why not
CHARLIE
Because she was a fifteen-year-old
girl then Shes a seventy-two-year-
old woman now

SOPHTA
I can do math Math is not a reason
not to write a letter

CHARLIE
It was a teenage infatuation a
holiday romance can you imagine
what couldve happened if she
hadnt seen sense

SOPHIA
Well you wouldnt be here I mean
at all Which Id have to say would
be an upside

CHARLIE
What good did you think could
possibly come from writing her that
letter

SOPHTA
What harm could come from it

Pause as they eye each other up

SOPHIA
So thats it You came all the way
from England to give me a lecture
Im impressed Or did you just
happen to be in town

CHARLIE
No I came because I couldnt let
my grandmother come on her own

SOPHIA
Claires here Why

CHARLIE
I think even you might be able to
work that one out

SOPHIA
Oh my God shes come to find her
Alfonso thats awesome I want to
meet her

CHARLIE
I want to play for Manchester
United but Im shit at football

SOPHIA
You honestly dont think shed want
to meet me

CHARLIE
I honestly think she has no
interest in meeting a woman who can
Manage to jam oh my God and
awesome into the same sentence

SOPHIA
Did you ask her

CHARLIE
It just wouldnt occur to her

SOPHIA
Where are you staying

CHARLIE
(laughs)
Dyou really think Im that stupid

SOPHIA
I havent decided yet

A beat Charlie gets up from the table

SOPHIA
Why did you come here tonight

CHARLIE
I was just curious to see what kind
of imbecile would think writing
that letter was such a great idea
I shouldve known itd be an
American Good night

He strides out of the restaurant Sophia is appalled at his
rudeness and is stuck to her chair for a moment

She looks across the room at Victor serving The Secretaries
their entrees They applaud his efforts Hes beaming

Sophia thinks for a beat Then grabs her coat and leaves

EXT LETTERE A GIULIETTA RESTAURANT -- LATER

Sophia emerges from the restaurant and looks around to see
which way Charlie has gone She spots him and starts to
follow him at a discreet distance

At one point he gets the feeling hes being followed and
stops He quickly turns around just as Sophia ducks into a
shop doorway

Finally he arrives at his hotel and heads inside Sophia
waits for a moment before heading in herself

INT HOTEL VERONA -- RECEPTION -- LATER

Sophia waits as the RECEPTIONIST looks something up on a
computer screen

RECEPTIONIST
Claire Smith - room 32

SOPHIA
Thank you

INT HOTEL VERONA -- CORRIDOR -- LATER

Sophia walks down the hallway to room 32 Shes nervous as

she takes a deep breath and knocks on the door She adjusts
her hair and straightens her dress The door opens And her
face drops as she is confronted by Charlie

CHARLIE
(whispers )
What the bloody hell are you doing
here

He moves out pulling the door semi-closed behind him
SOPHIA

I think maybe even you can work
that one out

CHARLIE
I told you she doesnt want to meet
you

SOPHIA

You told me it wouldnt occur to
her to want to meet me

A voice comes from inside the room

CLAIRE OS
Who is it Charlie
SOPHIA
(shouts )
My name is Sophia I wrote the
letter
CLAIRE OS

Well for goodness sake come in

Charlie looks daggers at her then reluctantly opens the door

INT CLAIRES ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Sophia walks into the room and there she is CLAIRE SMITH a
regal beauty at the age of seventy two She gets up and for a
fleeting moment bathed in a Veronese backlight she almost
looks like the fifteen year old who sent that letter all
those years ago

They take each other’s hand and don’t let go They take a
long look at each other - so many questions on either side

SOPHIA
You look like I thought youd look

CLAIRE
Since you wrote to a fifteen-year-
old Ill take that as a compliment

Sophia smiles Claire smiles Charlie isnt smiling

CLAIRE
How did you find us

SOPHIA
Charlie found me actually

Claire turns to Charlie who shrugs as if to say surprise
SOPHIA
He told me you were here and said
you might like to meet me
CLAIRE
How uncharacteristically thoughtful

of you dear

Slight pause He looks at Sophia who smiles innocently
CHARLIE
Well in the circumstances it
seemed a little churlish not to
meet the person responsible for
this voyage of lunacy

CLAIRE
Charlie doesn’t approve Which
makes it all the more fun Would
you like some tea Oh no of
course you’re American We’1l
order coffee Charlie

He obediently goes to the phone

INT CLAIRES ROOM -- LATER
They all sit having coffee while Claire talks

CLAIRE
I waited for a reply to that letter
for two years Once I even plucked
up the courage to run away and find
him But it only lasted as far as
Waterloo Station I’m afraid

CHARLIE
So why is it you never mentioned
him to me till last week then

CLAIRE
It was such a long time ago dear
And I met your grandfather and over
the years I did my best to forget
that summer in Tuscany and the
bronzed Adonis of a boy who kissed
me for the first time He was the
first person to ever tell me I was
beautiful And boy did it sound
more romantic in Italian

SOPHIA
Ill bet

CLAIRE
“Clara siete cosi bella”

CHARLIE
But you and Gramps were happy
enough weren’t you
CLAIRE
That’s exactly right - happy
enough We were a “good couple”
with much to be grateful for
Except for you Charlie you’ve been
the bane of my existence

Sophia smiles intrigued by these two

CLAIRE
Then when Jack died - there’s a lot
of Jack in Charlie funnily enough -
I grieved profoundly for years But
as time went by his memory became a
distant warm glow instead of a
searing pain in my side Then
unexpectedly at odd hours of the
day in my dreams at night I found
myself thinking about Alfonso
which made it all the more
extraordinary when out of the
blue your letter arrived I’m so
grateful you wrote it There were
so many reasons not to

CHARLIE
Ill say

SOPHIA
So what happens now

CLAIRE
Well the thing is I think weve
found him

SOPHIA
Really Where

CLAIRE
Just outside Verona Quite close to
where he used to live actually

SOPHTA
No Thats incredible

CLAIRE
Charlie thinks its a dreadful
mistake

SOPHTA

It’ll be fine really it will

Sophia looks at her watch

SOPHIA
I’m so sorry I have to go Im
flying down to Palermo with my
boyfriend for a few days before we
go home He’s found some kind of
weird cheese down there

CLAIRE
(slightly disappointed)
Of course you are Thank you so
much for the letter

They hug Sophia turns to Charlie who extends his hand
stiffly

CHARLIE
Its been a pleasure

SOPHIA
I guess your idea of pleasure and
mine are two very different things

For a moment he seems charmed by her directness and honesty
He smiles Claire gives her a piece of paper

CLAIRE
My phone number back in London
Will you call me

SOPHTA
I will I have to know how it ends

INT VERONA APARTMENT -- BEDROOM -- LATER THAT NIGHT

Sophia and Victor are in the middle of packing for Palermo

Sophias head is still in Claires hotel room Victor is
focused intently on packing hes not really listening

SOPHIA

I so hope it works out for her
VICTOR

Hmm
SOPHIA

I mean imagine if they found each
other after fifty years

VICTOR
Thatd be something

SOPHIA
Because I found a letter in a wall
its crazy its like no story
thats ever been told

VICTOR
Right

Sophia pauses on this thought Then the penny drops

SOPHTA
I have to write it

VICTOR
You can start on the plane

SOPHIA
I have to stay

Victors listening now

VICTOR
Wait What

SOPHTA
I have to know out how it ends

VICTOR
What about Palermo The cheese

SOPHIA
You dont need me for cheese You

Sophia starts unpacking her suitcase Victor stammers

VICTOR
Cant we at least discuss this

SOPHTA
I started it I have to finish it

VICTOR
But Who are these people Youre
just gonna go off with them They
could be serial killers

SOPHIA
Killers who oh-so-cleverly planted
a half century old love letter ina
wall for me to find How devious

She smiles keeps unpacking Victor just stands there racking
his brain for a reason she has to come with him

VICTOR
But Whos gonna take the pictures

INT HOTEL VERONA -- LOBBY -- LATER
Sophia is walking through Claires hotel on her cell phone

SOPHIA
I already have the title Does
True Love Have a Shelf Life

INTERCUT Bobby in his office on the phone with Sophia Hes
eating Chinese food as he scrolls through and answers e-mail

BOBBY
You cant actually think shell

SOPHIA
But what if hes not What if she
does What if that spark is still
there after fifty years

He cant He nods to himself Takes a bite of an egg roll

BOBBY
Could be something there
SOPHTA
So I should write it
BOBBY

Sophia smiles - good enough for her

INT HOTEL VERONA -- CORRIDOR -- LATER
Sophia is standing at Claires door Charlie opens it

SOPHIA
Hi

CHARLIE
Oh God

EXT STREETS OF VERONA -- DAY

Sophia Claire and Charlie walk through the streets towards
Juliet’s house Charlie casts a disbelieving glance at Sophia
- What is she doing here

CLAIRE
Alfonso had such a way with plants
Working those fields was spiritual
for him Hed always talk about the
land in Tuscany the way it
smelled the moisture in the soil
perfect for the grapes he’d grow
there one day He used to say all
he needed to be happy were days in
those fields and nights with me

Sophia smiles at this

CLAIRE
When he was working I’d pray for
the sun to come out because then
hed have to take off his shirt

CHARLIE
Nana

CLAIRE
He was so solid and brown The
sweat would glisten off his back
like little jewels The thought of
it still sends shivers down my

spine

CHARLIE
Alright I think we get the
picture

CLAIRE

What you dont approve of your old
Gran having carnal thoughts

CHARLIE
Oh for heavens sake

CLAIRE
Youre such a prude And youre
ageist

CHARLIE
I am not I love old people

SOPHIA
So long as theyre not thinking
dirty thoughts

Charlie bristles Before he can think of a deft reply

SOPHIA
Here we are

They walk into Juliet’s courtyard

CLAIRE
Gosh I remember this so well We
were on our way home I was so sad
Then I looked up at her an thought -
shed know what to do Ill ask
her

SOPHIA
Sorry it took her so long to get
back to you

Claire smiles

CLAIRE
No matter Im here now

A familiar voice comes from behind them

BELLA 0S
Is this her

Sophia turns and finds Bella holding a basket of the days
letters Bella is looking at Claire

SOPHTA
Claire This is Bella Shes one of
The Secretaries

CHARLIE
Ah yes another interfering
busybody Perfect

Neither Bella nor Claire pay him any mind They smile

BELLA
Its such a pleasure to meet you

CLAIRE
And such an honor to meet you

Claire goes to shake her hand but Bella grabs her and hugs
her and kisses her on both cheeks

INT LETTERE A GIULIETTA RESTAURANT -- LATER

Claire is the guest of honor at the head of a table with
Charlie Sophia and the rest of The Secretaries Theyre
eating dinner The Secretaries are all smiling at Claire

BELLA
Are you nervous

CLAIRE
A bit I suppose What if I’ve
turned him into something he isn’t
He’s always existed in my mind’s
eye as a model of perfection Like
a ‘57 Bentley Continental What if
he’s actually a clapped out old
Alfa Romeo with bundles of nose
hair What if he doesn’t remember
me at all - if I was simply not to
him what he was to me

Slight pause as they all think about this Charlie wades in

CHARLIE
Right Let’s go home then before it
all ends in tears

SOPHIA
What is it with you Its like you
really dont want this to work out

Charlie is aghast at such a suggestion - a little too aghast

CHARLIE
Im a realist not a fantasist
thats the point

BELLA
No its not The point is youre
English

MARIA
No romance

FRANCESCA
Lots of cynicism

DONATELLA
Cold as fish

CHARLIE
You dont have to be a cold fish to
think the idea of true love lasting

forever is ridiculous
(MORE)

CHARLIE (contd)
Actually come to that the very
idea of true love at all leaves one
struggling

BELLA
Well in that case we take it all
back

Everyone laughs except Charlie Claire smiles softly at him

CLAIRE
Charlie why don’t you get yourself
out of the line of fire and settle
the bill

He motions for the waiter to bring the bill As soon as she
sees this Angelina comes striding across the restaurant

ANGELINA
No charge

CHARLIE
Im sorry we couldnt possibly

ANGELINA
Im sorry you can possibly

He looks at her - realizes this isn’t someone you mess with

EXT STREETS OF VERONA -- LATER THAT NIGHT

The Secretaries are walking with Claire laughing and
chatting Charlie and Sophia follow at a short distance

CHARLIE
You know I’m not the buttoned up
buttock clenching killjoy you lot
are trying to make me out to be

SOPHIA
Right We made you argue that true
love is ridiculous Thanks for
clearing that up

CHARLIE
Its just that I am genuinely
worried for her

SOPHTA
Shell be fine
44

CHARLIE
Physically yes But what if he
breaks her heart What if he laughs
in her face What if he doesn’t
remember her Is it so unreasonable
for me to worry about that

SOPHIA
My gut says thatll never happen

CHARLIE
Then you really do have greater
faith in mankind than I do

They walk on watching the women walking ahead Sophia smiles

CHARLIE
You really think its possible two
people can be apart for so long and
pick up right where they left off

Sophia reflects on the question

SOPHIA
I dont know I hope it is

CHARLIE
Why are you doing this

SOPHIA
To find out I guess
(smiles)
Plus I think Ive got a bit of a
crush on your grandmother

He looks at her slightly disturbed

INT HOTEL VERONA -- SOPHIAS ROOM -- NIGHT
Sophia sits at a desk with her laptop open She starts to

type Stops for a moment She closes the laptop Something
doesnt feel right

INT HOTEL VERONA -- NEXT MORNING

Sophia Claire and Charlie are loading up the rental car

SOPHIA
Before we go anywhere I need to be
straight with you both My being
here is not entirely selfless It
started as that

(MORE)

SOPHIA (contd)
And I do want to help But I’d also
like to write an article about what
happens I want to tell your story

Claire

CHARLIE
A bloody journalist I shouldve
known

SOPHIA

Hardly Im a fact checker Ive
never had a word published

CHARLIE
And you think Grans story is your
ticket to being published Yeah

SOPHIA
I think her story is a story worth
telling

Claire smiles her approval

CLAIRE
Well I think that’s simply
marvellous We both get something
out of it It’s a what d’you call
it A win win

Sophia smiles appreciatively

CHARLIE
I’m so pleased for you both but
where exactly do I fit in

CLAIRE
Don’t worry dear Every story
needs a comedy character

She gets into the car Sophia smiles at Charlie

SOPHIA
This is going to write itself

Something starts buzzing in her bag She fishes around in it
and brings out her cell phone She grimaces

SOPHIA
I missed Victor I had it on silent
all night Hes probably frantic

CHARLIE
I would be I’d have probably
killed myself by now - in a most
violent manner leaving a poignant
note which would haunt you forever

CLAIRE 0S
(from inside the car)
Charlie

Sophia cant help but smile at Charlie as she dials Victor

SOPHIA
I hope hes not too worried

INT AN ORGANIC DAIRY FARM IN PALERMO WHERE

Victors looking anything but worried as hes enthralled with
an assortment of samples of a stocky CHEESE MAKERS finest
Italian cheeses Hes a kid in a candy store He tastes some
fresh made pecorino romano It leaves him speechless

His Black berry - set on silent - is flashing on his belt
buckle CLOSE ON The Display The ID reads Sophia

CUT BACK TO

Sophia putting her phone away and getting in the car with
Charlie and Claire

CHARLIE
Was he frantic

SOPHIA
I couldnt get him Hes probably
out in the country out of range

CHARLIE
Or hes working on that note

Claire smacks Charlie on the top of his head Sophia laughs

SOPHIA
How about you Is there some lucky
girl who makes you frantic

CHARLIE
There is one - was one - until
recently Patricia But the less
said about her the better so
currently no I am without
“frantic” in my life and the sense
of relief is palpable

SOPHIA
For everyone Im sure

IE CAR (DRIVING) -- LATER

They travel towards Arezzo Charlie driving Claire beside
him and Sophia in the back leaning forward between the seats

SOPHIA
Victor used to work at this little
Italian place in The City Id go
there to work every week Id get a
double espresso and a water - no
ice And hed come by my table
tell jokes make small talk Then
one week he bought my espresso a
week later he bought me lunch then
dinner a week after that he cooked
me dinner at his place and three
months later I moved in with him

CLAIRE
How romantic

With a longing that tells us this was as romantic as it got

SOPHIA
Yeah it was
CHARLIE
So you live with a waiter then
CLAIRE
Charlie youre such a snob
CHARLIE
I am not He might have been a bus
boy
SOPHIA

Hes a chef actually A talented

one Hes opening his own place
(slight pause)

Its gonna be great I know it He

wont let it be anything else

CLAIRE
Sounds like quite a catch Your
mother must be pleased

SOPHTA
Im sure she would be

Claire looks worried shes made a dreadful assumption

CLAIRE
Oh dear Has she passed on then

SOPHTA
Moved on is more accurate She left
when I was little

CLAIRE
Im sorry

SOPHIA
(shrugging it off)
Dont be Im not

Charlie looks at her in the rear view mirror as she stares

out of the window and sees that nothing could be further from
the truth as she displays a rare moment of vulnerability

EXT FARM HOUSE OUTSIDE VERONA -- LATER

The car stops at a narrow country road in front of an old
farmhouse surrounded by meadows and olive groves

Claire Sophia and Charlie look at the old house through the
car window Claire doesn’t move Sophia takes her hand and
gives it a squeeze Claire smiles then gets out of the car

EXT FARM HOUSE -- FRONT DOOR -- LATER

The trio approaches the door Charlie glances at Claire She
nods yes Charlie reluctantly knocks on the door They wait a
moment Nothing He shrugs

CHARLIE
No one in Come on Lets go

SOPHTA
Charlie

He takes Claire’s hand and starts for the car Then the door
opens They stop and turn as ALFONSO appears at the door
he’s 73 dark and ruggedly handsome Sophia and Charlie gape

CHARLIE
(in fluent Italian)
Are you Alfonso De Annunzio

The man nods Charlie and Sophia exchange a glance - weve
found him - but alas Claire knows immediately that

CLAIRE
Thats not him

SOPHIA
Are you sure

CLAIRE
Its not him

SOPHTA
But he looks

CLAIRE
Its the eyes

CHARLIE
Do you remember what you were doing
in the summer of 1951

ALFONSO
(smiles wistfully)
Ah the summer of 1951 Ill never
forget it I met the most beautiful
girl with long brown hair

CHARLIE
Nana

But Claire has already turned away disappointed and is
walking towards the car

CLAIRE
Theyre not his eyes Its not him

ALFONSO
We married that year and she
gave me nothing but trouble from
that day on I curse that woman

CHARLIE
Right

He and Sophia follow Claire to the car as Alfonso continues
raving from his doorstep

ALFONSO
I curse her eyes I curse her
teeth I curse her mustache

They get into the car A beat of silence

CHARLIE
Right well thats that We gave it
a fair shot Cant say we didnt
try Sorry Nana Truly

SOPHIA
Are you for real

CHARLIE
If I actually knew what that
question meant I might attempt to
answer it

SOPHIA
He can’t be the only Alfonso De
Annunzio in Tuscany

CHARLIE
Hes the only one around here Are
you suggesting we knock on the
doors of every Alfonso we can find

SOPHIA
Are you suggesting we dont

Charlie looks at Claire Its obvious she wants to keep
looking Charlie sighs as if to say Fine

CHARLIE
This is madness Total madness

SOPHIA
How many can there be

EXT HOTEL SWIMMING POOL -- THE NEXT DAY

Claire is lying on a sun bed in the shade Charlie swims
relentlessly up and down the pool - quite clearly for
exercise rather than pleasure Sophia sits at a nearby table
working away at her laptop She finishes typing

SOPHIA
Thirty six

CLAIRE
That many

Claire sighs Sophia has an idea
SOPHIA

I might be able to find some
pictures online Give me a minute

At this point Charlie hauls himself out of the pool He has a
surprisingly well toned body This guy obviously works out
Sophia can’t help but notice

SOPHIA
(quietly to herself)
Whoa

She sees Claire smiling at her She blushes

SOPHIA
Did I just say that out loud

CLAIRE
I believe “ripped” is the
appropriate modern term isn’t it

SOPHTA
(smiling)
Ok here we go Ive found photos
of two of them

Claire takes a look and sighs

CLAIRE
No Sorry
SOPHIA
So that leaves us with thirty four
CHARLIE
(approaching)

Thirty four what

SOPHTA
Contestants for Italian Idol

CHARLIE
Fantastic

He walks away drying himself off
SOPHIA
Is he really unhappy about this or

just pretending

CLAIRE
A bit of both I think

Claire watches Sophia working on her laptop as if weighing up
whether she’s going to ask her what’s on her mind

CLAIRE
Tell me about your mother

SOPHIA
(without looking up)
Nothing to tell

CLAIRE
Indulge a nosy old lady

Slight beat Sophia looks at this woman with such kind eyes
and sees someone who genuinely wants to know

SOPHIA
There’s nothing much to say really
I was young I dont remember much
Then one day she just upped and
left Just like that No warning
no note no forwarding address not
even a goodbye or good luck

CLAIRE
How old were you

SOPHIA
I was ten

CLAIRE
And you havent seen her since

SOPHIA
Dont expect I ever will

CLAIRE
That mustve been very hard

Sophia shrugs as if to say not really

SOPHIA
I started packing my own lunches
probably ironed a few more of my
dads shirts than I would have

CLAIRE
You dont ever think about trying
to find her

SOPHTA
I used to Until I realized that
she didn’t feel like she could
waste her time on me so why should
I waste a minute of mine on her

Sophia looks down in an attempt to control her feelings
Claire takes her hand and gives it a squeeze
INT HOTEL RESTAURANT -- NIGHT

The three of them are having dinner

CLAIRE
Charlie have you told Sophia about
the Green Alliance

CHARLIE

Cant imagine shed care
SOPHIA

Try me
CLAIRE

Charlie’s going to stand for
parliament on the environment
ticket

Sophia looks genuinely surprised

CHARLIE
You know the kind of thing -
planting trees air fare taxes
bicycle lanes eliminating cars
from Central London - great idea
pity it doesn’t stand a chance
really

SOPHIA
Thats amazing

CHARLIE
You look surprised

SOPHIA
I guess I am I didnt have you
pinned as a Save the planet type

CHARLIE
And what type did you have me
pinned down for exactly

SOPHIA
I dont know I was leaning towards
the elitist Oxford prig type but
now that you mention it self-
satisfied do gooder fits too

CHARLIE
Well thank you very much

Sophia laughs So does Charlie Claire smiles at this

CLAIRE
Oh don’t be fooled by all the
posturing he’s just a little teddy
bear really

She ruffles up his hair

CHARLIE
Get off

CLAIRE
He’s still trying to work out our
carbon print for this little jaunt

CHARLIE
Anther good reason not to have
come

CLAIRE
Hell have me planting trees for
months
(she yawns)
Well Im off to my bed You two be
nice to each other now

She kisses them both on the head and leaves

SOPHTA
Shes incredible

CHARLIE
Yeah shes alright

But with her gone it seems they have nothing to talk about
So they just sit there in silence A pantomime of
embarrassment An exchange of awkward smiles Then finally

CHARLIE
Right Well Time to hit the sack

Sophia smiles she knows hes just trying to get out of this

SOPHIA
It must be at least nine thirty
CHARLIE
Long day tomorrow Need my rest and
all that
SOPHIA

Oh of course

CHARLIE
Right Alright Good night then

He gets up and strides off leaving her at the table Then he
stops in the entrance His back is turned to her for a moment
then he swivels round and marches straight back

CHARLIE
Forgive me Where are my manners

SOPHIA
I have absolutely no idea

CHARLIE
I don’t know what it is but you
seem to bring out the very worst in
me

SOPHIA
I figured it’d be my fault somehow

CHARLIE
Please may I buy you a night cap

A beat She smiles politely

SOPHTA
No thanks Im tired

CHARLIE
Right Of course Apologies

SOPHIA
Accepted

He stands there for a minute unsure what to do

CHARLIE
Well Good night then Again

SOPHIA
Good night Charlie
INT CAR (DRIVING) -- THE NEXT MORNING
A beautiful day in the Tuscan countryside They drive along
with Puccini’s “La Boheme” blaring from the stereo Charlie
is driving He looks at Sophia curiously in the rear view

mirror Claire notices this and smiles to herself

La Boheme continues over the next few scenes

EXT ITALIAN VILLAGE -- LATER

Sophia and Charlie are talking to an OLD MAN wearing a flat
cap a baggy black suit which has seen better days and a
threadbare white shirt Hes sitting outside at a cafe with
another MAN playing chess Claire is standing at a distance
watching

Sophia turns round to look at her and Claire shakes her head

EXT LAKE -- WATER SKI AND WIND SURFING SCHOOL -- LATER

A speedboat hurtles arcing towards the shore The WATER
SKIER behind it lets go and after a few feet sinks into the
water near the jetty

Claire Sophia and Charlie walk towards the jetty as the
speedboat approaches THE INSTRUCTOR jumps out he is a
bronzed seventy-three-year-old man with an enormous pot
belly covered in gold jewelry and masses of white body hair
Beneath his stomach he is wearing the tiniest most obscene
inappropriate thong you’ve ever seen When he turns to
someone and flashes his weary pitted buttocks their way
Claire utters a little shriek Sophia tries to suppress a
grin but Charlie is beside himself with laughter

Sophia hits him playfully The man waves as they approach but
from Claire’s horrified look it obviously isn’t him

EXT CHURCH -- LATER

They are with a sweet looking PRIEST dressed in cassock and
hat outside his church He is holding both of Claire’s hands

as he shakes his head gently He is not her Alfonso Then he
makes the sign of the cross over Claire as a blessing

EXT PALAZZO -- LATER

They drive a tree-lined street to a gorgeous stately Palazzo
CHARLIE
You sure weve got the right
address

Sophia double checks

SOPHIA
This is the place

EXT PALAZZO -- FORMAL GARDENS -- LATER

They are talking to a very handsome beautifully dressed and
groomed Italian man This guy is probably a COUNT He shakes
his head Claire smiles
COUNT
Alas it wasn’t me If it had been
I’d’ve never let you go

And with that he kisses her hand

EXT PALAZZO -- DRIVEWAY -- LATER
They walk towards the car Claire is still slightly flushed
SOPHIA
What is it with you and Italian
men They just fall at your feet
Charlie takes one last look at the Palazzo He sighs
CHARLIE
Such a shame I think I could’ve

been happy here

Sophia and Claire exchange looks

INT OLD FOLKS HOME SIENA -- LATER

Sophia Claire and Charlie wait patiently and quietly ina
waiting room Sophia is trying to stay upbeat but the sight
of so many ill and lonely OLD PEOPLE has definitely lowered
the mood of all three

A NURSE comes to them holding the arm of yet another ALFONSO
a sweet man bald wearing sunglasses with a bright smile
He walks right up to Claire

ALFONSO
Your face it is so familiar

Sophia and Charlie exchange a hopeful glance
CHARLIE
Alfonso this is Claire do you

remember Claire

ALFONSO
Claire Of course Of course

Alfonso takes off his sunglasses to get a better look at her
Sophia and Charlie instantly look at Claire It’s not him

SOPHIA
(quietly)
Shit

Hes confused her for someone else Claire plays along so as
not to hurt the sweet old mans feelings She hugs him

CLAIRE
It was good to see you Alfonso

ALFONSO
You too my angel Thanks for
visiting Come back soon

He waves to them as they go - they made his day

Sophia sighs

INT HOTEL ROOM NEAR SIENA -- NIGHT

Sophia is on her cell in her room Her notebook is open on
the desk next to her laptop She’s clearly been working on
the story The remains of her dinner are on a plate nearby

SOPHIA
I hope we’re doing the right thing
She’s so full of hope one minute
then deflated the next The ups and
downs are killing me I cant
imagine whats it like for her

INT SMALL RESTAURANT IN PALERMO WHERE

Victor has a Bluetooth ear piece in Hes paying close
attention to every detail about how the restaurant is running
and not paying any attention to what Sophia is saying Thus

VICTOR

SOPHIA
Did you listen to a word I just
said
VICTOR OS

I miss you beautiful
Sophia rolls her eyes - hes so transparent

SOPHIA
Miss you too

A WAITRESS brings Victor a plate of food He smiles his
thanks and wafts the steam coming towards his nose

VICTOR
If you could see the plate of food
I’ve just had put in front of me

Victor eagerly lays a napkin in his lap
VICTOR
Hey Can I call you back I feel
like I should have all my senses
for this

SOPHIA
Yeah Sure Enjoy

Sophia hangs up She sighs a sigh that says Did my boyfriend
really just get off the phone to pay attention to a meal

INT SOPHIAS HOTEL ROOM -- LATER THAT NIGHT

Sophia sits at the desk with her laptop open Shes looking
at that cursor blinking at the end of a full page of writing

She smiles - pleased at this
Theres a knock at her door She answers Its Charlie
CHARLIE

Shes gone to bed - shattered poor
thing
SOPHTA
Think shell be OK

CHARLIE
Oh yeah yeah she’ll be fine
Tough as old boots that one Don’t
be fooled by the frail old lady act
- she’s Churchill in a dress

Sophia laughs Charlie smiles He clears his throat

CHARLIE
You fancy a spot of dinner

SOPHIA
I already ate I needed to get
started

He sees the notebook and laptop

CHARLIE
Hows it coming

SOPHIA
Slowly

CHARLIE
Am I in it

SOPHIA
You are

CHARLIE
Can I read some then

SOPHIA
No

CHARLIE

Oh go on Please

SOPHIA
When its finished Maybe

CHARLIE
But how am I to be sure that Im
being properly portrayed

Sophia smiles

SOPHIA
Youre just going to have to trust
me

CHARLIE
Just a peek A sentence or two

He tries to look over her shoulder She blocks his view

SOPHTA
You dont trust me

CHARLIE
(matter of fact)
Youre an American

Sophia cant help but laugh

CHARLIE
Youre sure you wont let me read
just a bit to ease my mind

Sophia shuts the door From the other side of the door

CHARLIE 0OS
Is this one of those situations
where youre really saying the
opposite of what you actually mean

SOPHTA
Its not

CHARLIE 0S
Right Good night then

SOPHIA
Good night

They each remain where they are on either side of the closed
door smiling and waiting for the other to move Finally he
moves away and she leans back against the door more than a
little charmed

INT HOTEL NEAR SIENA -- LOBBY -- THE NEXT MORNING

Sophia is waiting in the lobby writing in her notebook
Charlie comes down the stairs and over to her

CHARLIE
Grans not feeling well

SOPHIA
What is it Whats wrong

CHARLIE
I dont know
SOPHTA
Should we call a doctor

CHARLIE
Best just let her rest

Sophia suddenly looks and feels very guilty

SOPHIA
I shouldnt have pushed her

CHARLIE
It’s not your fault Truth is she
made her decision the moment that
letter arrived And neither I nor
the entire regiment of the
Household Guard would’ve been able
to stop her from coming

SOPHIA
But if I hadnt come back from the
airport

CHARLIE
If you hadn’t come back from the
airport I would’ve been denied the
pleasure of spending a day in your
glorious company showing you the
sights of San Gimignano and Siena

Sophia smiles - she feels better already

INT

They drive together through the Chianti countryside

SOPHIA
You can actually be quite charming
when you put your mind to it

CHARLIE
Oh dont let it fool you

CAR (DRIVING) -- LATER

SOPHIA
So whats your story Charlie

CHARLIE
Not worth telling really Certainly
not worth writing about

SOPHIA
Cant I just be curious

CHARLIE
You can be whatever you want

SOPHIA
Okay So how does a guy your age
come to live with his grandmother

CHARLIE
She lives with me actually

SOPHTA
Well that makes all the difference

CHARLIE
It does rather

SOPHTA
How does the rest of the family fit
in Mom Dad brothers and sisters

CHARLIE
Im an only child

Sophia laughs - of course he is

SOPHIA
Why doesnt that surprise me

CHARLIE
-And my parents were killed in a
car crash when I was fourteen

Sophia’s mouth is still open from laughing but she now seems
incapable of either shutting it or speaking She just stares

CHARLIE
Hit head on by a tourist driving on
the wrong side of the road An
American tourist

He reaches over and gently pushes her jaw closed with the
tips of his fingers A beat

CHARLIE
Ive had ambiguous feelings towards
anything American every since

SOPHTA
Understandable

Charlie smirks - trying to ease a maudlin moment

CHARLIE
Could have something to do with my
cynicism and pessimism and general
lack of faith in true love lasting
forever Not a great believer in
happy endings Im afraid

SOPHTA
(quietly)
Oh God Charlie Jesus

CHARLIE
Yes well they weren’t much help
either But Gran stepped in and
took this angry bereft and
shockingly unpleasant young man
under her wing and made me well
into the superb specimen of screwed-
up manhood you see before you now

He laughs She doesnt She puts her hand on his arm

SOPHIA
Im so sorry

He looks at her hand on his arm and raises his eyebrows
gently mocking her She quickly takes her hand away

CHARLIE
I owe everything to that woman She
looked after me when no one else
would when no one else could

SOPHIA
And now its your turn

CHARLIE
Right She

Charlies voice cracks with emotion He smiles at her
CHARLIE
Sorry Momentary slip Wont happen
again
Sophia smiles at his English stiff upper lip then looks away
out of her window to spare him any embarrassment

EXT PIAZZO DEL CAMPO SIENNA -- LATER

Sophia sits outside a cafe Charlie appears from inside with
two of the largest ice cream cones you’ve ever seen

SOPHIA
Little indulgent dont you think

He gives her a cone

CHARLIE
Ah but the thing is theyre
calorie free Clever buggers the
Italians

She looks at her cone suspiciously as he starts to eat his

SOPHIA
No way

CHARLIE
Yes way Thousands of calories free
with every mouthful

Sophia laughs - not at joke but at him for making the joke

SOPHTA
That was bad

CHARLIE
I thought it was funny Youve no
sense of humor

She pushes his ice cream into his face He takes it away to
reveal his nose and mouth covered His stone faced
seriousness and slight look of hurt make her laugh

SOPHIA
That was funny

He wipes his face with a napkin
CHARLIE
It’s just as well I’m a gentleman
otherwise I might be tempted into
some sort of juvenile revenge

SOPHIA
Im grateful believe me

They sit eating their cones for a beat She looks at him
He smiles

Shes not

They sit quietly eating for a beat Charlie shrugs

She looks at him as she tries to work this through

SOPHIA
I had a great time today It was
nice actually doing the tourist
thing with someone Thanks

She studies him for a moment

SOPHIA
Whats the real reason youre so
against Claire being here

CHARLIE
(smirks)
Every good story needs an
antagonist right

letting him off that easy

SOPHIA
Theres something else going on in
that head of yours You jealous

CHARLIE
Of an old man Ive never met No

SOPHIA
So What is it Are you worried
youll lose her

CHARLIE
Something like that

CHARLIE
Okaytruthfully Its just that I
feel if we find Alfonso and Gran
discovers that leaving him all
those years ago was indeed the
biggest mistake of her life then
what does it say about me and my
family It makes it all a bit of a
sham doesn’t it If theyre meant
to be then were we not Its like
were second best

SOPHIA
But you know thats not true

CHARLIE
Maybe But it feels true

forward noticing something on her face

He leans

CHARLIE
Youve got something on your

With that he pushes her ice cream into her nose She screams
There’s ice cream all over her face He gets a napkin and
gently wipes it off When he finishes he doesn’t move away
Suddenly both their cell phones ring They look at them

CHARLIE SOPHIA
Patricia Victor

Neither of them answer Charlie looks at her - surprised

CHARLIE
You didnt answer Very naughty

SOPHIA
Neither did you

CHARLIE
But I have a good excuse Shes a
tiresome self-centered neurotic
Shes mad Madder than a mad cow
Your Victor on the other hand is a
dashingly handsome chef about to
become a New York culinary
sensation sounds like everything
any girl could ever want

Sophia smiles as she knows what Charlies saying is true

SOPHIA
He is I suppose

Her smiles fades She looks at him sincerely
SOPHIA
(almost to herself)
What if Im not just any girl

Charlie smile diplomatically - hes not gonna go there

EXT HOTEL NEAR SIENA -- DUSK

Charlie’s car pulls up He and Sophia get out of the car
They walk towards the hotel in silence Until

SOPHIA

Me too

She smiles then turns and walks away

INT HOTEL NEAR SIENA -- LOBBY -- LATER

Charlie and Sophia walk back into the hotel past the bar and

There sitting at the bar large cocktail in hand sits Claire

CHARLIE
Feeling better

CLAIRE
Right as rain dear Thank you

CHARLIE
(slowly)
Good

CLAIRE
So How was your day Did you two

She smiles sweetly as both of them realize in the same moment
what she’s been up to They share a look and a smile

EXT CEMETERY NEAR FLORENCE -- NEXT DAY

Claire Sophia and Charlie are escorted through a cemetery
by an old GRAVE DIGGER They stop The Grave Digger points at
a new tombstone and goes off silently They stand together

SOPHIA
(silently to herself)
God no Please no

They look at the grave from a distance Claire slowly
approaches it as Charlie and Sophia hang back

CHARLIE
This was what I feared most

Charlie trails off and watches as Claire approaches the grave
- her back to us She stops and kneels

Sophia and Charlie stand there saying nothing Claire stands
up and walks back to them She Long pause

SOPHTA
Is it

CLAIRE
Its not him My Alfonsos middle
name was Paolo Its not him

Relief washes over Sophia But not Charlie who still stands
there with concern etched all over his face

SOPHIA
OK So We keep looking

CHARLIE
No

They turn to him And wait for him to say more but he just
stands there silently staring as if trying not make a scene

SOPHTA

Charlie its not over
CHARLIE

Yes it is Its over Im done
SOPHTA

But-—-
CHARLIE

(snaps )

Don’t you see what we’re doing
What we’re putting her through
What if it had been him What if
there’s another grave around here
with her Alfonso in it I’m sorry
Gran I am But this is the end of
the line for me I cant do this

Claire looks at her beloved grandson and can see the sincere
concern and pain on his face She takes his hand Sighs

CLAIRE
OK

SOPHIA
Youre giving up Just like that

CLAIRE
Hes right dear Its too much

Sophia stares at Charlie Shes stone faced

CHARLIE
What

SOPHIA
This is what you wanted all along

CHARLIE
No What I wanted was for you to
never have written that letter
What I wanted was to never come on
this ridiculous goose chase

SOPHIA
Why are you so desperate for this
to fail

CHARLIE

Im trying to protect her Because
unlike you I cant just stand idly
by and watch her get hurt

SOPHIA
What is that supposed to mean

CHARLIE
It means youre not here for her
And youre not here cause youre
some romantic who wants to believe
in love lasting forever Youre
here for the story Here to see how
it all ends Doesnt matter to you
if its a happy ending or a sad
ending as long as its compelling
right As long as theres drama

CLAIRE
Charlie Please

Sophia just stands there stunned hurt

SOPHTA
You think thats true

Charlie shrugs as if to say isnt it

CHARLIE
Im just looking out for her

SOPHIA
Youre not Youre not walking away
for her youre walking for you

They look at each other Both fuming Both pretty sure
theyve crossed a line

CHARLIE
She’s dealt with enough grief in
her life Shes lost her husband
her daughter her son-in-law Now
you come along and set her up to
lose someone she already lost fifty
years ago But why should I expect
you to understand You dont know
anything about real loss

This cuts her She just looks at him for a moment then walks
over to the car and gets in the back seat

CLAIRE
Youre wrong Charlie She lost her
mother That was very wrong

CHARLIE
Its different

CLAIRE
It is Her mother chose to leave
her You always knew your parents
loved you

She walks back to the car leaving him to think for a moment

INT CAR (DRIVING) -- LATER

They ride in silence as the sun sets A very unsmiley car

INT HOTEL NEAR FLORENCE -- EVENING

Sophia sits at the dressing table brushing her hair Theres
a knock at the door She thinks for a moment whether to
answer it Another knock She gets up and opens the door
Claire is standing there

CLAIRE
Just wanted to make sure you were
alright

SOPHIA

Of course I am Totally fine Hey
we gave it our best shot didn’t we

CLAIRE
We did

She sees the hairbrush in Sophia’s hand

CLAIRE
May I
SOPHIA
(a little taken aback)
Sure

She goes back to the dressing table and sits Claire stands
behind her and starts to brush her hair

CLAIRE
One of the great unsung luxuries in
this world - having someone brush
your hair

SOPHIA
(smiles)
Yeah I guess it is

CLAIRE
My mother used to do it for me

They continue in silence then slowly tears begin to fall

down Sophia’s face It’s clearly the first time anyone has
done this since for Sophia since she was a little girl

INT RESTAURANT FIESOLE -- LATER THAT NIGHT

Claire Sophia and Charlie look at their menus in silence
Charlie steals glances at Sophia who just studies her menu
He looks at Claire who raises her eyebrows interrogatively as
if to say “ball’s in your court” He clears his throat

CHARLIE
I should apologize I was wrong

SOPHIA
You should or you are

CHARLIE
Didnt I just

SOPHIA
Im not sure that you did

Claire intercedes

CLAIRE
An apology dear is when you look
at someone straight in the eye with
contrition and sincerity and
actually say the words “I’m sorry”

He does his best under the scrutiny of his grandmother

CHARLIE
Sophia Im sorry enough
contrition and sincerity for you

CLAIRE
Six out of ten

CHARLIE
Whatd you want me to do get on my
knees and beg

Charlie starts to do just that Sophia smiles She stops him

SOPHIA
Please dont Im sorry too

Claire smiles as the tension eases Charlie picks up a wine
list

CLAIRE
Excellent Now that hostilities are
over Lets get drunk

Sophia laughs as the waiter comes over to Charlie

CHARLIE
A bottle of your best local Chianti
please

The waiter goes off to fetch the wine

CLAIRE
So Sophia what for you now

SOPHIA
Back to Verona see Bella and the
girls then fly home I guess

CHARLIE
With the dashingly handsome Victor

She seems slightly perplexed by his saying this and he looks
embarrassed like he just thought out loud She smiles

SOPHIA
With the dashingly handsome Victor

Somehow though the prospect doesn’t seem so alluring
CLAIRE
Despite what my emotionally stunted
pig of a grandson thinks you did a
wonderful thing for an old lady
Ill never forget it

SOPHIA
Even though it led nowhere

CLAIRE
It’s been an adventure There
aren’t many adventures left at my
age And It didnt lead nowhere I
got to meet you didnt I

SOPHIA
I guess Though a new friend isnt
much consolation for an old love

CLAIRE
Depends on the friend

Sophia smiles

CLAIRE
Unfortunately you had to meet
Charlie but then we can’t have
everything can we

SOPHIA
It wouldn’t have been quite the
same without him

CHARLIE
Thank you

SOPHIA
My pleasure

He looks at her - not all sure what that means
CHARLIE
You have a knack of saying things
which could be taken as gorgeous
compliments or sarcastic digs

SOPHIA
It’s taken years of practice

The waiter arrives with the wine He pours them a glass

CLAIRE
To Alfonso wherever he may be

each
CHARLIESOPHIA
Alfonso

They raise their glasses and drink

CHARLIE
Damn that’s good wine

CLAIRE
(looking at the bottle)

She smiles broadly

CLAIRE
But then so it should be

She turns the bottle round to them

CLAIRE
Look at the label

Charlie picks it up and reads it
CHARLIE
“D’Annunzio” How do I know that
name

Sophia and Claire share a smile and a shake of the

CLAIRE
I sometimes find it hard to believe
I’m actually related to you

SOPHTA
You don’t think

As the penny drops Charlie beckons the SOMMELIER
CHARLIE
Excuse me The makers of this wine

Are you familiar with them

SOMMELIER
Iam Yes

Claire hardly dare ask
CLAIRE
And is there an Alfonso Paolo

D’Annunzio

SOMMELIER
Signora there are three

INT SOPHIAS HOTEL ROOM -- LATER THAT NIGHT

Sophia is at her laptop typing She looks out of the window
for a moment and sees Charlie wandering out of the hotel into
the garden He looks up at the sky and then lies down on the
lawn his arms spread-eagled She smiles

EXT HOTEL GARDEN -- LATER
Sophia comes out of the hotel and wanders over to him

SOPHIA
You OK

CHARLIE
Just looking at the stars

She lies down beside him

CHARLIE
You can see the Milky Way

SOPHTA
Its beautiful

CHARLIE
Its awesome

She laughs and hits him Charlie is no longer looking at the
night sky

CHARLIE
You have a wonderful laugh

SOPHTA
You have a wonderful frown

Slight pause They both look away
CHARLIE
So what do you think will happen

tomorrow

SOPHTA
If it’s him

CHARLIE
Oh it’s him alright

SOPHIA
How d’you know
CHARLIE
Because weve come too far itd
just be too unfair if it wasn’t

SOPHIA
Charlie Am I hearing right Is
that optimism I detect

CHARLIE
Im capable of it on occasion

SOPHIA
Well whatever happens something
tells me they’1ll be great friends

CHARLIE

I hope so She deserves it
SOPHIA

She does
CHARLIE

And what about you What’s in the
stars for you and Victor

We can tell Sophia has been thinking about this

SOPHTA
Wish I knew

CHARLIE
Successful business Marriage Lots
of dashing children

SOPHIA
Successful business marriage lots
of kids Victor becomes a celebrity
chef travels the world cooking for
royalty while I stay at home
microwaving leftovers for the kids

CHARLIE
And you think Im cynical

SOPHIA
When it comes to cynicism and love
were not even in the same league

CHARLIE
Sounds like we’d make quite a pair

SOPHIA
Shame Im spoken for

CHARLIE
You dont strike me as the kind of
girl whod let anyone speak for
her

She smiles He sits up Hes confused

CHARLIE
So what about all that romantic
true love codswallop you peddled
about Gran and Alfonso then

SOPHIA
I want them to prove me wrong
That’s all I want to believe two
people can reconnect and it can all
be OK I’m clinging to the wreckage
of “there’s always hope”

Charlie looks at her It suddenly makes sense to him

CHARLIE
Because of your mom Yeah

She looks at him Shrugs as if to say probably

SOPHTA
Its what a shrink would tell me

They lie there in the grass in silence for a moment

SOPHIA
You know all the things your
parents are supposed to give you -
safety food a roof over your head
- the one thing everyone takes for
granted is the most important
unconditional love

She smiles at him bravely A tear falls down her cheek He
leans over and wipes it away She manages another smile

SOPHIA
Sorry Momentary slip Won’t happen
again

He smiles at her

Theres a moment

humor She looks at him He looks at her
Then suddenly he kisses her And she kisses

back hungrily passionately For a few seconds theyre
unaware of anything but each other

Then Sophias head catches up to her heart She pulls back

SOPHIA
Okay Time out Not good I mean
too good So really not good
She gets up and heads back into the hotel He stands up

CHARLIE
Sophia wait I

She starts running and she’s gone He pauses a moment then

walks into the hotel As he does so we see Claire standing in
her bedroom window smiling gently having observed it all

CHARLIE
Has Miss Marcus checked out

EXT ROAD IN FIESOLE -- LATER

Bright and early The car speeds along a dusty country road
along the perimeter of a vast vineyard

They pass a sign that says “D’Annunzio Vineyards 1961”

EXT DRIVEWAY -- DANNUNZIO VILLA -- LATER

The car stops at a large farm house nestled in the midst of
the vineyard The vines are bursting with young blue grapes

As Claire steps out of the car she looks around and sees
something in the distance that nearly stops her breathing

A handsome YOUNG MAN around 16 shirtless solid and brown
from the sun he works repairing an irrigation line He
looks up and sees the three strangers in his driveway and
smiles a shy welcome

Claire can’t believe her eyes

CLAIRE
My God That’s him That’s Alfonso

CHARLIE
That can’t actually be him

SOPHIA
If it is then Im writing a
completely different article

CLAIRE
Are you Alfonso DAnnunzio

ALFONSO III
Yes maam

At that moment a middle-aged man comes round the corner He
is ALFONSO D’ANNUNZIO JR Alfonso III’s father

ALFONSO III’S FATHER
Did someone call me

CLAIRE
Are you Alfonso DAnnunzio too

Before he can answer a voice comes from inside the house

DON ALFONSO’S VOICE
I know that voice

Suddenly a sweet old man tanned from the sun comes stepping
out of the house He is DON ALFONSO PAOLO D’ANNUNZIO

He looks at the three strangers - then focuses on Claire
Without saying a word Claire smiles she knows this is him
The young man from all those years ago It’s the eyes

As she walks toward him he stares at her disbelieving as
years and years flicker through his memories

DON ALFONSO
Claire

She nods The tears are already starting to form And shes
not the only one as Sophia hastily wipes a tear away

Claire and Alfonso stop opposite each other They stare into
each other’s eyes older certainly yet indelibly etched in
each others hearts Theres a long silence Neither sure
what to say or do Claire manages a coy little smile

CLAIRE
Sorry Im late

Alfonso smiles He opens his arms She walks into them
Claire and Don Alfonso embrace Everyone watching smiling
Something prompts Sophia to look down It’s Charlie’s hand
reaching out for hers She takes it and looks up at Charlie
He turns to her his eyes looking suspiciously tearful He’s

about to say something but can’t She smiles

SOPHTA
You’re welcome

EXT DANNUNZIO VILLA -- OPEN FIELD -- SUNSET

A space behind the D’Annunzio house filled with tables and
trees The vineyards all around Don Alfonso’s big family is
out en masse to celebrate the reunion of their patriarch with
his childhood sweetheart

Four generations CHILDREN GRANDCHILDREN AND GREAT-—
GRANDCHILDREN Tables laden with food

Claire and Don Alfonso sit together drinking and catching up
after the years of separation

Sophia is surrounded by sprightly D’Annunzio grandchildren
who play a game with her She stops and looks around as she
realizes someone is missing

She goes off in search of Charlie

She finds him alone by some trees staring at the horizon
Hes deep in thought She takes a moment to just watch him
She smiles then walks up slowly

SOPHIA
Hes a widower just lost his wife
two years ago And now Claire
Here On his doorstep after fifty
years how does that happen

CHARLIE
You made it happen

Sophia smiles Charlie goes back to staring at the horizon

SOPHIA
Happy or sad I can’t tell

CHARLIE
Bit of both actually Happy for
them A little sad it’s over

SOPHIA
Mission accomplished

CHARLIE
If you like

SOPHTA
You have to admit it was kinda fun

CHARLIE
It was

Pause

CHARLIE
About last night

SOPHIA
Don’t worry about it

CHARLIE
Really

SOPHIA

Mistakes happen

CHARLIE
A mistake Yeah

They look at each other both not telling the truth both
knowing it neither has the courage to take the first step

CLAIRE
Maybe I’m afraid to be happy again

DON ALFONSO
There are so many worse things to
be afraid of at our age

He takes her hand and smiles sweetly She smiles back
comforted by his words They hug each other reassuringly

He turns to Charlie and holds out his hand Charlie takes it

CHARLIE

She smiles hoping its for the reason she thinks it is

DON ALFONSO OS
There she is Theres our angel

Sophia turns to find Don Alfonso beaming at her Shes
visibly taken aback at his appearance Hes so much thinner
and what little hair he had left has turned a shade greyer
he walks with a cane now and has a pronounced limp but still
he looks like royalty in a fine Italian tuxedo His grandson
Alfonso III escorts him on his way

Don Alfonso stops and kisses Sophia on both cheeks

DON ALFONSO
Thank you for coming

SOPHTA
Wouldnt miss it for the world

CHARLIE
Papa they need you at the altar

He smiles and kisses Sophias hand before continuing on into
the church Sophia watches him limping on that cane She
turns and looks at Charlie She doesnt even have to ask

CHARLIE
He fell About two months ago He
and Gran were walking in his
fields Tripped on vine Shattered
his hip Had to have it replaced

Sophia watches Don Alfonso smiling and welcoming guests as he
slowly makes his way down the aisle

SOPHTA
Thats terrible

CHARLIE
Saved his life actually

Sophia turns back to Charlie who takes a breath before

CHARLIE
He only fell a few feet but the hip

shattered like a vase
(MORE)
CHARLIE (contd)
(beat)
A tumor had hollowed it out

Sophia just stares - speechless

SOPHTA
Is he OK Is he

CHARLIE
They think a year maybe two maybe
more maybe less Different doctors
give different answers none of
them straight you know how it
goes

SOPHIA
My god How awful

Charlie looks with a smile at Don Alfonso who has finally
made it to his place at the altar He shakes his head

CHARLIE
Actually theyve been
extraordinary Really Its
humbling Theyre living proof that
if you find love for even the
shortest moment you have to grab
it with both hands

Charlie catches himself being sincere He tries to play it
off with a wry shrug and smile

CHARLIE
Tis better to have loved and all
that

She manages a smile back

SOPHTA
And all that

They look at each other for a long moment Sophia looks as if
shes about to say something when

PATRICIA 0S
There you are

At that moment a strikingly beautiful English woman in a gown
that matches Charlies suit approaches She is PATRICIA

PATRICIA
You need to get outside Shell be
here any second
Sophia just stares at her Momentarily speechless

CHARLIE
Patricia This is Sophia

Doing her best to hide her disappointment

SOPHIA
Hi

Realization flashes in Patricias flawless eyes

PATRICIA
The Sophia

CHARLIE
The Sophia

Sophia shrugs and smiles
PATRICIA
Oh its so nice to finally meet
you Youre kind of a legend around
here you know

A silent beat Patricia turns to Charlie

PATRICIA
Ill see you up there Dont trip

CHARLIE
As if Im not nervous enough

She kisses his cheek smiles at Sophia and heads off down

the aisle

SOPHTA
Shes beautiful

CHARLIE
Yeah Scrubs up well I suppose

SOPHTA
And is she

Before she can ask the question an old Italian limousine
rolls to a stop at the front steps as Alfonso III walks up

CHARLIE
And there she is Places everyone
(to Alfonso III)
Can you show Sophia to a seat

Alfonso III hold out his arm Sophia takes it She looks at
Charlie He looks at her and smiles

CHARLIE
Show time

Charlie heads out to the white limo as Alfonso III ushers
Sophia down the aisle The church is idyllic festooned with
white flowers everywhere The floral arrangements at the end
of the pews contain bunches of dark purple grapes

The Secretaries of Juliet are together in a pew They wave to
Sophia as she passes Bella ever the romantic is already
crying handkerchief in hand

When Sophia gets to a seat she looks to the altar where Don
Alfonso stands waiting for his bride He turns to look at
Sophia He smiles sweetly then closes his eyes for a few
seconds in a silent expression of gratitude She smiles

Then the organ begins and a hush falls over the congregation

Charlie escorts Claire down the aisle She looks beautiful
All the excitement and radiance of a teenage bride

As they pass she sees Sophia and her whole face just lights
up She gives her a discreet wave Sophia smiles and waves
back but its all too much and the tears begin to come

Charlie walks Claire to Don Alfonso He gives her away

EXT SMALL VILLAGE IN TUSCANY -- LATER

THE WEDDING PARTY is led through the narrow streets of the
village towards the vineyard by a loud brass band

VILLAGERS outside bars stand and applaud Others lean out of
upstairs windows throwing confetti whistling and cheering

Alfonso walks arm-in-arm with Claire at the center of it all

Beside them Patricia and Charlie and Alfonsos son and
grandson

And lastly the gathering of GUESTS Sophia is among the first
cluster just behind the wedding party Everyones eyes are on
The Bride and Groom except Sophia whos watching Charlie

The parade continues Its a colorful joyous carnival of an
occasion A day not soon forgotten in this little village
EXT DANNUNZIO VILLA -- OPEN FIELD -- SUNSET

Tables have been laid for the wedding feast The BAND plays
CHILDREN run around FRIENDS and FAMILY chat and laugh

At the head table sit the bride and groom Charlie and
Patricia are seated on either side of them

Sophia is at another table with the Secretaries of Juliet
She steals glances at Charlie over her glass of wine

Charlie stands and taps his glass Everyone turns to him
The band stops and silence falls Charlie clears his throat

CHARLIE
Its been a sincere honor giving
away my Gran today Though shes
left me in the market for a room
mate if anyone knows anyone some
light cooking and laundry required

This gets a chuckle Charlie smiles at Claire as he says

CHARLIE
Im not allowed to make a speech

Someone shouts “Shame”

CHARLIE
So Ill just get right to it
then Ladies and Gentlemen may I
present for the first time Mr and
Mrs Alfonso DAnnunzio

Everyone stands and cheers Claire and Alfonso kiss

CHARLIE
Now I believe Mrs DAnnunzio would
like to say a few words Gran

Everyone claps Claire kisses Charlie and stands He sits

CLAIRE
I won’t keep you long as Im sure
most of you have heard the story of
how my husband

Everyone cheers and whistles at the first mention of the
word She smiles It gets quiet again

CLAIRE
Fifty-seven-years ago I wrote a

letter that asked a question
(MORE)
CLAIRE (contd)
Fifty-seven years later I got an
answer

(she looks right at)
Sophia Dear Would you stand up

Sophia hesitates then stands reluctantly She turns red with
embarrassment Charlie smiles at this

CLAIRE
Sophia gave me my answer

Everyone starts clapping and cheering her as Claire unfolds a
piece of paper Sophia recognizes it - turns redder

CLAIRE

She wrote me a letter This letter
Without it none of this wouldve
been possible none of us would be
here today and so it seems only
fitting to share some of it

(she starts reading)
What and ‘if’ two words as non-
threatening as words come But put
them together side-by-side and they
have the power to haunt you for the
rest of your life ‘What if

She looks at Sophia now and basically reads the letter to her
as if no one else were there

CLAIRE
I dont know how your story ended
But I know that if what you felt
then was love - true love - then
its never too late If it was true
then it why wouldnt it be true
now You need only the courage to
follow your heart

Sophia is looking at Charlie who looks straight back at her

CLAIRE
I dont know what a love like that
feels like a love to leave loved
ones for a love to cross oceans
for but Id like to believe if I
ever felt it Id have the courage
to seize it I hope you had the
courage to seize it Claire And if
you didnt I hope one day that you
will

She folds the letter and looks at Sophia - we can see the
glaze of tears forming as everyone starts clapping
Charlie sees those tears forming too

Sophia looks at him sitting there beside Patricia and then
abruptly turns and walks off away from the gathering

The tears have started to fall She wipes them away

SOPHIA
Im sorry I have to go

Charlie watches Sophia go He catches Claire looking at him
as if to say What are you waiting for A beat

Then he gets up and goes after her

EXT DANNUNZIO VILLA -- LATER
Charlie walks around to the front of the house

CHARLIE
Sophia

He walks to the front door and calls inside

CHARLIE
Sophia

He walks round the corner towards the vineyards and looks
down the rows of fruit laden vines

CHARLIE
Sophia

He goes back towards the house and then spots her in a first
floor window redoing her make up in front of a mirror A vine
grows up this side of the house up to and beyond the window

He walks up to the house and shouts from below

CHARLIE
Sophia

She looks out of the window - it should of course be
reminiscent of Shakespeares balcony scene

CHARLIE
What are you doing

SOPHIA
I’m leaving

CHARLIE
Why
SOPHTA
I shouldnt have come here

CHARLIE
Did you listen to what Gran just
said To what you wrote

SOPHIA
I’m happy for you She’s gorgeous
Not at all how I imagined

CHARLIE
Who

SOPHTA
Patricia

CHARLIE

Patricia She’s my cousin

SOPHIA
Your cousin Good God Is that
legal in England

CHARLIE
Different girl Same name She’s
like a sister to me And a daughter
to Gran We practically grew up
together after you know

This gives Sophia pause She looks down at him

CHARLIE
Don’t go

SOPHIA
Why Why should I stay Charlie

He starts to climb the vine towards her with some difficulty

SOPHIA
What are you doing

CHARLIE
The thing is I’ve watched Gran and
Alfonso over the last few months
and I’ve realized that I can’t
wait fifty years to say

He’s level with her now but has to pause to get his breath

CHARLIE
«-I love you Sophia
SOPHIA
What

CHARLIE
That kiss wasnt a mistake Poorly
timed yeah But not a mistake

SOPHTA
You love me

CHARLIE
I do

SOPHIA
So why are you looking at me like
that

CHARLIE
Like what

SOPHTA
Terrified

CHARLIE
I remembered about half way up the
vine I’m a bit scared of heights

She looks at him Smiles

SOPHIA
I love you too

Slight pause She leans into kiss him But he doesnt move

SOPHIA
So are you gonna kiss me Or

CHARLIE
I would Yeah It’s just that I
appear to have lost my foot--

And with that he disappears from the window - screaming all
the way down until he hits with a thud

SOPHTA
Charlie

She looks down to see him lying prostrate in a bush

INT MAIN HOUSE -- LATER

She rushes through the villa down the stairs and out
through the hall to the front yard
She runs up to him Hes moaning in pain

SOPHIA
Are you OK

CHARLIE
(groans )
Please tell me no one saw that

Sophia looks up and sees the entire wedding party looking at
Charlie lying there

SOPHTA
No one saw it

CHARLIE

SOPHTA

Can you move
He stays completely still as he smiles

CHARLIE
Only my lips

She leans over and kisses him as Claire and Alfonso watch
approvingly from a distance As we

FADE TO BLACK
