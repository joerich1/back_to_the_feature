INT JEAN-DO’S ROOM NAVAL HOSPITAL - DAY
Blackness Silence
The blackness slowly very slowly begins to lighten

As if ata distance THE SOUND OF TWO VOICES a man’s and a womans
chatting little more than intermittent murmurs

Then suddenly close

AFEMALE VOICE
(urgent)
Look He’s waking -

AMALE VOICE
Page Dr Cocheton Quickly

Almost immediately

THE FEMALE VOICE
Dr Cocheton come to room 119 please
Dr Cocheton to room 119 please -

ASUDDEN FLASH the faces of TWO NURSES one male the other female
Then justas suddenly blackness again

THE MALE VOICE
No no Jean-Dominique open your eyes -

Like a flickering eyelid a picture begins to take shape a small bare hospital
room the faces of the NURSES either side of a bed both looking down
expectantly directly into CAMERA

THE CAMERA IS JEAN-DOMINIQUE BAUBY KNOWN AS JEAN-DO

As his eyes open he sees first the foot of his bed then curled paralysed
hands on the yellow sheets the V pole hanging over him and THE TWO
NURSES smiling leaning towards him

THE FEMALE NURSE pats his cheek

FEMALE NURSE
(gentle)
Jean-Dominique
(a flicker)
No no keep your eyes open youve been
asleep for a long time youre waking up

Brief silence then the sound of a door opening and closing Another figure
suddenly appears the NURSES giving way for him as he comes close to
the head of the bed

He’s DR COCHETON mid-30s handsome confident He wears a white
coat stethoscope round his neck He looks down at JEAN-DO

DR COCHETON
Monsieur Bauby Excellent Now open

INT CAR- DAY

QUICK FLASH the face of a young boy (THEOPHILE) seated in the front
beside the driver (unseen) terrified and

INT JEAN-DO’S ROOM NAVAL HOSPITAL - DAY
As before COCHETON and THE NURSES

JEAN-DO’S VOICE
(a whisper)
Vaguely -

DR COCHETON
(slowly and insistent)
Do you remember what happened

JEAN-DOS VOICE
I said vaguely -

COCHETON tries to conceal his anxiety
DR COCHETON

(gently)
You’re in the Naval Hospital Berck-sur-

Mer On the coast In Normandy You were
treated firstin Paris and then brought
here Do you remember that

JEAN-DO’S VOICE
Im not sure -

COCHETON flicks a look of concern at the NURSES

DR COCHETON
You see Jean-Dominique youve had a
stroke You’ve been in a coma for almost
three weeks But now you’re waking up
and youll be fine promise you I’m just
going to give you one or two simple tests

JEAN-DOS eyes follow COCHETON as he edges slowly down the side of
the bed to the foot then to the other side

DR COCHETON (contd)
Good You understand -

JEAN-DOS VOICE
Of course understand -

DR COCHETON
When say blink please blink

JEAN-DO’S VOICE
Céleste Théophile

COCHETON glances at the NURSES who are also plainly concerned Then
COCHETON again looks at JEAN-DO

DR COCHETON
All right don’t worry its a slow process
Your speech will come back

JEAN-DO’S VOICE
I can’t speak

But COCHETON and the NURSES leave the immediate vicinity of the bed
and huddle in a corner where they confer in whispers their backs to JEAN-
DO

JEAN-DO’S VOICE (contd)

Why can’t you hear me

(a dread realisation)
Oh Christ can’t speak

(he looks at his curled lifeless

hands)

I can’t move Whats happened to me
can’t remember --1-

(a hollow cry)
My name is Jean-Dominique Bauby

(COCHETON and the

NURSES continue to confer)

Oh my God -

(trying to calm himself)
All right all right ve had a stroke - my
speechll come back - mymemorywill
come back -

(becoming drowsy)
- Ill be patient - oh God - okay okay -
believe you - believe - believe -

His voice trails off and his eyes close

The screen goes black

INT JEAN-DO’S ROOM NAVAL HOSPITAL - DAY

Blackness
Achapel bell begins to toll seven

JEAN-DOS eyes slowly open to see a frayed curtain over a window
admitting the first rays of dawn

His eyes find the wall by his bed to which there are pinned a variety of items
photos of two children - a boy and a girl - posters signed photos of two or
three good-looking women (one of them SYLVIE) children’s drawings
especially one of Mickey Mouse And dozens of get-well cards And there’s
an intercom nearer the door

Then also on the wall but close to the bed he catches sight of a glass
frame in it a cover of Elle’ magazine with two beautiful models ina
seductive pose

But he also sees his own very dim REFLECTION in the glass a prostrate
figure in a bed and two staring eyes

The bell finishes tolling
His eyes linger on the reflection
The door opens and the FEMALE NURSE bustles in

FEMALE NURSE
Monsieur Bauby -

She goes to the window and with a flick opens the curtain to admit early
morning sunlight As more light enters his image in the glass frame
disappears She turns to the bed all smiles

FEMALE NURSE (contd)
Now Lets see -
(checking the drip feed and
tracheostomy)
- what have you been up to during the
night

JEAN-DO’S VOICE
paid a flying visit to New York What
happened to you

FEMALE NURSE
(filling in a chart)
Youre doing very well And this morning
you have an important visitor Dr Lepage
your neurologist So we want you at your
very best -
She goes to the TVset at the foot of his bed turns it on and leaves

ON THE TV SCREEN a cartoon of a FROG leaping about swimming
hopping insanely to the accompaniment of appropriately jaunty music

JEAN-DOS VOICE
If could only be that frog

HE CLOSES HIS EYES SCREEN GOES DARK HE OPENS THEM AGAIN

The door bursts open and DR LEPAGE enters smiling He is in his 50s
avuncular kindly well-meaning He is accompanied by DR COCHETON
and the TWO NURSES

DR LEPAGE

(as he enters)
Good morning good morning My name’s
Alain Lepage Im your neurologist You
know Dr Cocheton of course

(sits on the bed)
Jean-Dominique - no no your friends call
you Jean-Do so that’s what I’m going call
you Jean-Do Because want you to think
of me as your friend and as your friend

(smiles and then becomes

serious)

Jean-Do know how difficult this is for you
also know that nobody has explained to
you the full extent of your condition Well
thats myjob Yes My job

(accepts the burden with a

sentimental smile)

You’ve had what we call a cerebrovascular
accident It’s put your brain stem out of
action The brain stem is an essential
component of our internal computer the
link between the brain and the spinal cord
n the past we would have said youd had
a massive stroke You would very probably
have died But now we have such
improved resuscitation techniques that
we’re able to prolong life

JEAN-DO’S VOICE
Is this life
DR LEPAGE

(overlapping)
Yes prolong life Im not going to mince
words You are paralyzed from head to toe
And as you now must have realised you
are unable to speak

(allows it to sink in)
You have what we call ‘locked-in
syndrome’

(very clearly)
‘Locked-in syndrome’

And while he allows that also to sink in

JEAN-DO’S VOICE
(a gasp)
Oh Christ Noirtier de Villefort -

INSERT A 19TH CENTURY IMAGE OF NOIRTIER

DR LEPAGE
It will be of no comfort to you but your
condition is extremely rare Extremely rare
And we simply don’t know the cause You
don’t smoke and youre not a heavy
drinker So Im afraid its just one of those
things However apart from being totally
paralysed we believe you are normal in
every other respect

JEAN-DO’S VOICE
Normal

DR LEPAGE
(overlapping)
And so there is hope Yes hope We know
your brain is functioning You’re able to
understand us You follow our movements
with your eyes Although I’m not entirely
happy with your right eye -
(He pulls at JEAN-DO’S EYES
and slightly distorts the
picture)
- but Ill take a second opinion on that
Good So We want you to take iteasy fora
few days -
He stands

JEAN-DO’S VOICE
What d’you think Im doing now

DR LEPAGE
- and when you’re stronger two beautiful
young women wiil visit you envy you
because when say beautiful mean
beautiful Theyre therapists and theyre
miracle workers And so as I say there’s
hope Ill come again Soon Youll be well
looked after Well looked after

And while he confers with COCHETON who takes notes -

JEAN-DO’S VOICE
(echoing)
Locked-in syndrome -

The sound of bubbling water and

ON THE BLINK

Into the murky green sea a large diving bell of shining silver is lowered

panicked breath on the glass He’s hammering desperately at the porthole
with his fists Then

Close to the bed a man in a white coat and surgical gloves the
ophthalmologist DR MERCIER is taking needle and thread from a small
padded box He has a gruff manner and never once looks at JEAN-DO

DR MERCIER

He starts threading the surgical needle

Rapid blinks

He starts to stitch JEAN-DOS right eye on CAMERA
Soon half of the screen goes black
He closes his good eye and the screen goes completely dark

JEAN-DO’S VOICE
Now please don’t get God please

HE OPENS HIS EYES AGAIN AND HIS PLANE OF VISION HAS CHANGED
(THE CAMERA HAS CHANGED LENSES)

DR MERCIER finishes stitching

never looking at JEAN-DO)

resignation)
No

And as DR MERCIER turns to the door it is flung open Into the room come
a great host of white coats led by DRS LEPAGE and COCHETON DR
LEPAGE pushes a wheelchair

DR LEPAGE
Good morning good morning

DR MERCIER shoves aggressively through the mob and goes

JEAN-DOS VOICE
Hello hello

bed

LEPAGE leans over him

DR LEPAGE

(cheerful as ever)

(to the students in a low voice)
First were going to dress him Good for

(to JEAN-DO)
And then we have a wonderful surprise for
you Awonderful surprise

JEAN-DOS VOICE
Let me guess you’re going to sew up my
other eye -

Nurses produce a plaid shirt old pants and a shapeless cashmere
sweater

JEAN-DO’S VOICE (cont’d)

my old pants make me want to cry- but if
I must drool it might as well be on
cashmere

LEPAGE and COCHETON at the foot of the bed smiling They are
temporarily obscured as the sweater is pulled over JEAN-DO’S head and
adjusted

DR LEPAGE
(beaming)
Chic very very chic Now we’re going to try

Two attendants come either side of JEAN-DO take his shoulders lift him off
the bed and dump him in the wheelchair

DR COCHETON
Bravo

DR LEPAGE
Wheel him up and down will you
(to JEAN-DO)

trigger uncontrollable muscular spasms
Sorry bear with us please bear with us -

He is wheeled back and forth across the small room

COCHETON
He needs a cushion behind his head -

Acushion is placed behind his head changing the angle of vision All

ring of a life sentence

DR LEPAGE
Thatis very good news Very good news

(to the nurses)
Blankets We dont want him catching cold -

They cover JEAN-DO in blankets

INT ELEVATOR NAVAL HOSPITAL - DAY

Descending There’s a mirror that covers one entire side of the elevator but
LEPAGE COCHETON and an ATTENDANT obscure most of JEAN-DO
except that he can see his lifeless hands on the arms of his wheetchair
and a rug covering his legs

As the elevator shudders to a hait -

DR LEPAGE
And now for the surprise -

INT MAIN HALL HOSPITAL - DAY

Large echoing Other patients in wheelchairs Gurneys bearing prostrate
patients being pushed at speed

One wall is lined the entire length with glass-fronted cupboards A stained-
glass window depicts Empress Eugenie the wife of Napoleon Ill the
hospital’s patroness

JEAN- DO accompanied by LEPAGE and COCHETON is wheeled slowly
by the ATTENDANT out of the elevator down the length of the hall towards
the far end where open double doors admit winter sunshine

In the glass-fronts of the cupboards he catches glimpses of his reflection
mouth twisted hair tousled one eye sewn shut the other bulging But this
image is seen intermittently in one glass-front after the other almost like a
cubist painting

JEAN-DO’S VOICE
Oh my God whos that Its a monster No
no its me ls that my surprise To see
myself look as if Ive emerged from a vat
of formaldehyde Christ if only they could
hear me don’t want this dont want to
see myself

The last of the images of JEAN-DO and his entourage in the glass-fronts of
the cupboards as he is wheeled towards the open double doors and out
into the pale sunlight

EXT TERRACE HOSPITAL - DAY

JEAN-DO emerges through the double doors on to a large tiled terrace
overlooking a grey sea

The terrace is empty but for the silhouette of an elegant woman standing a
little distance away the sun behind her

JEAN-DOS VOICE
(a whisper)
Sylvie -

Slowly he is pushed towards her She takes a step forward but stops trying
vainly to control her reaction at seeing him She is slim and vibrant Her
name is SYLVIE LAROCHEFOUCAULD late 30s

She gazes at him with infinite sadness
LEPAGE moves towards SYLVIE and looks at JEAN-DO

DR LEPAGE

JEAN-DOS VOICE
She’s not mywife She’s the mother of my
children

everything Everything If you aska
question make it a yes-or-no question
He’ll blink One for yes two for no Just
keep talking to him Im sure you have a lot
to say to each other

He stops realizes his clumsiness and goes quickly followed by the others

The gentle sound of the sea Asoft breeze ruffles SYLVIE’S hair She leans
towards him and gently caresses his face

JEAN-DO’S VOICE
H only could feel that

She is usually a woman of great energy and vivacity but she’s subdued

now

Silence

JEAN-DOS VOICE (contd)
Yes youre trying not to let me know that
Im horrible to behoid know Ive seen

SYLVIE
(ata loss)
Oh my dear

JEAN-DO’S VOICE

(one blink)
Ive met the speech therapist Sandrine

Silence Somewhere very distant the sound ofa train

Impulsively she takes hold of his paralysed hand and kisses it gently fora
long moment

JEAN-DOS VOICE
If could only feel that kiss -

INT HOT TUB ROOM NAVAL HOSPITAL- DAY

being washed ina therapeutic bathtub

He is twisted and turned by the MALE and FEMALE NURSES

HIS EYES swing to the ceiling to the wall to the room to the ceiling again
Other patients are also being bathed

Aparalysed arm comes into a view a lifeless leg

JEAN-DOS VOICE
Up down up Im finding this funny I really

undersheet)

JEAN-DO’S VOICE (contd)

over him)
But as someone’s poet said only a fool
laughs when there’s nothing to laugh at -

INT JEAN-DO’S ROOM NAVAL HOSPITAL - DAY

I know you you’re Pierre Roussin

ROUSSIN tries to conceal his shock

ROUSSIN
You don’t remember me

JEAN-DO’S VOICE
Of course I do
(one blink)

SANDRINE
(to ROUSSIN)
He blinks once for yes and twice for no
Do you want me to leave

JEAN-DO’S VOICE ROUSSIN
(blinks twice) You can stay
Please No

Roussin lights a cigarette

ROUSSIN

t heard what happened to you And I just
wanted - no lwas compelled to come
and see you because of what happened
to me Ina way know what you’re going
through and thought could be of some
help

(he stares at JEAN-DO)
Being taken hostage is not so different
from what you’re going through

(turns to Sandrine)
Am right

SANDRINE
Hostage

Awkward silence

ROUSSIN
Sorry am allowed to smoke

SANDRINE
You’re already smoking

ROUSSIN

(to Sandrine)
Anyway Jean-Dominique was kind
enough to give me his seat on a flight to
Hong Kong Then unfortunately for me
the plane was high-jacked and
remained a hostage in Beirut for four
years four months two weeks five days
and seven hours

(He smiles nervously)

(to Jean-Do)
Pve been told you have locked-in
syndrome They kept me ina cellar Very
small Dark It was hard to breathe
called it my tomb Yes

(to Sandrine)
know a lot about wines used to recite
aloud the wines of the Bordeaux
classification of 1855 That’s what
preserved my sanity Or what passed for
sanity

He lights a new cigarette off the old one He smiles at the memory but it’s
more of a twitch than a smile

ROUSSIN (contd)

Of course there were times was in
despair Suicidal Angry The beatings
the filth the cruelty The passage of time
was the worst But survived survived
because held fast to my own humanity
That’s all could do because that’s all
had And that’s all you have Jean-
Dominque

(fervently)
Cling to your own humanity and youll
survive
just had to come and say that to you
Face to face In person know it sounds
ridiculous but I felt it was - I felt it was my
duty Tell yourself every day that the
human spirit is indomitable Christ knows
why It has no reason to be But it is
Indomitable

(silence)
just had to say that to you in person
Good-bye

(a blink)

SANDRINE
Good-bye thank you for coming

Roussin walks away

lam ashamed never called him after he
returned from Beirut But felt too guilty

SANDRINE

(overlapping)
That makes me very angry There are
people who love you and care for you Im a
complete stranger and yet care for you
And you’re alive So don’t say you want to
die It’s offensive Its - its obscene

(long silence she stares

menacingly at him)

You want to go on with this

Right Ill come back another time and see
if youve changed your mind

And as she turns to march out of the room he closes his eye

it bounces and settles and the snow continues to fall But then a strange
noise the noise of a clockwork toy

EXT TERRACE HOSPITAL - DAY

ATOY MOTORCYCLE on a table top travelling in circles And when it nearly
falls over the edge AHAND reaches out and saves it

The hand belongs to LAURENT 42 shaggy untidy bear-like Acrash-
helmet on a chair

Spring weather THE FEMALE NURSE sits a little apart She knits from a
pattern and pays no attention to them

This area is an extension of the terrace In the distance out atseaa
lighthouse with red and white stripes A light aircraft drones overhead

LAURENT

bring would have asked Sylvie to suggest
something but -

LAURENT (contd)

While was out here waiting for you a little
beauty came up to me and she gave me
this -
(takes the alphabet card pen
and note pad from his
pocket)

not surprised’ and she said had to cheer
you up
(shows the card to JEAN-DO)

What about a better view of the sea
(calling to the NURSE)
Is it all right to move his chair

FEMALE NURSE
Of course -

He wheels JEAN-DO to a vantage point from which he can look atthe sea
and the lighthouse

JEAN-DO’S VOICE
Im so tired And I’m so happy don’t have
to answer him back Poor fool we can
both drown

LAURENT
Hows that

He begins to lope aimlessly JEAN-DO doesn’t bother to follow him so
LAURENT just comes and goes in and out of JEAN-DO’S line of vision

LAURENT (contd)
lve never been a good hospital visitor I’m
the sort who brings the patient grapes and
then eats them What an awful thing Jean-
Do You of all people Everybodys talking
about it was in Café de Flore last night -
no the night before - the usual crowd
don’t know who it was but heard
someone Say ‘Did you know that Jean-Do
Baubyis now a complete vegetable’ And
someone else said Yes heard a
complete vegetable’ And wanted to say
‘Im going to see him and bet you he’s
not I’ve heard his mind is working
perfectly

He breaks off He’s out of JEAN-DO’S eyeline But JEAN-DO swivels his eye
to find LAURENT looking helpless and forlorn

JEAN-DO’S VOICE
(outraged)
Avegetable A vegetable Who said was
a vegetable Who

LAURENT
Im an idiot Christ I’m sorry hope
havent upset you But you know me -

He turns away and gazes atthe sea

which resembles Antonioni’s “la Ventura” He glimpses corners of the

a vast series of balconies that open onto
a landscape heavy with the poetic and off-
beat charm of a movie set

EXT SHORE and SEA - DUSK

JEAN-DO and CLAUDE by the sea enjoy the view In the distance
buildings and nearer the sea

Ahandful of buildings at the foot of the
sand dunes give the illusion of a ghost
town in a Western
As for the sea itself it foams such an
incandescent white that it might be the
product of the special-effects department

EXT TERRACE- DUSK TO NIGHT

JEAN-DO is in his wheelchair on the terrace as the sunis setting and the
light slowly fades CLAUDE is taking dictation

The lighthouse can be seen in the distance

But my favorite sight of all is the
lighthouse tall robust reassuring in red
and white stripes place myself under the
protection of this brotherly symbol
guardian notjust of sailors but of the sick
whom fate has cast to the far edge of life

CLAUDE closes her notebook It’s the end of a workday She leaves Jean-
Do alone to enjoy the view

The lighthouse beam switches on and the light sweeps across Jean-Do’s

She is dressed all in pink sneakers jeans and sweatshirt

ANUN walks down the column

THE NUN
(calling out repeatedly)
If it rains everyone into the basilica

JEAN-DO and JOSEPHINE walk alongside the helpless and the badly
handicapped

They have to stop to wait for a jam to clear

JEAN-DO smiles at a paraplegic who sticks his tongue out JEAN-DO
deeply embarrassed turns away

And then a chant starts

PILGRIMS

And Ave Marias are chanted

The chant and prayers continuing

JEAN-DO
Joséphine there’s no way I’m going on

JOSEPHINE
Pity it could do a sinner like you a lot of
good -

JEAN-DO
Don’t be so sure it might be dangerous
What if someone in perfect health
happened to be here when the Madonna
appeared One miracle and he’d end up
paralyzed

A dozen heads turn to see them

JOSEPHINE
Youre an imbecile

JEAN-DO
Thank you -

JOSEPHINE

into the ornate gold frame He’s mixing lather in a bow with a shaving
brush

Among the PHOTOGRAPHS a boy in a turn-of-the-century sailor suit a
pretty woman in her 20s holding a baby more recently in colour a girl in
riding gear (Céleste) and another of a boy (Jean-Do) aged 11 in black and
white on a miniature golf course

JEAN-DOS VOICE

its been warming

He approaches his father known as PAPINOU seated hunched in a red
armchair and wearing a dressing gown

PAPINOU is 92 years old but still astonishingly handsome with a plume of
white hair crowning his tall frame

JEAN-DO wraps him in the towel

with a brush)
You mean she feeds you every four hours

PAPINOU

his eyes

INT GRAND PARIS RESTAURANT - NIGHT

From a high angle we see SIX WAITERS carrying platters filled with
assorted gourmet dishes Like dancers ina minuet they glide in the
spacious ornate room

The camera takes flight and we hear the fluttering of wings It floats from
tray to tray mimicking a butterfly in a field of flowers

The camera settles on a large platter of oysters ona bed of ice lemons
brown bread and butter which is being offered to JEAN-DO wearing
casual chic the only customer

He nibbles thinly-sticed salami off a tooth-pick while sipping a glass of
champagne

JEAN-DO takes up a shell unhooks the oyster with a fork slides it into
his mouth He closes his eyes as the oyster slips down his throat He
smiles He opens his eyes

He looks across the room and sees CLAUDE looking beautiful Their eyes
meet and he invites her over to savor his treats He immediately slides
an oyster into her mouth He is able to show his charm generosity and
his connoisseurship by sharing his feast

Each taste that JEAN-DO will experience seems to be an overwhelming
experience sending him into ecstasies of silent delight and profound
pleasure

THE SOMMELIER approaches with a bottle of Chablis JEAN-DO examines
the label nods THE SOMMELIER pours for him to taste which he does
and nods again

CLAUDE happily watches JEAN-DO enjoy his feast

THE WAITERS as if choreographed serve him a medley of gastronomic
pleasures with expertise elegance and theatricality

WAITERS wheel a serving station on which rests a silver salver with a
grilled sole

One presents it for JEAN-DO’s approval JEAN-DO nods sips his wine and
watches the man expertly and speedily fillet the fish and serves it to them

JEAN-DO with child-like anticipation sprinkles a little salt squeezes lemon
and then eats elegantly and delicately always making sure Claude is also
enjoying

The red wine is produced shown and decanted THE SOMMELIER lights a
smail candle under the decanter to check the colour and consistency of the
wine JEAN-DO smiles admiringly He pours it for JEAN-DO to taste

Jean-Do and Claude toast

AWAITER serves them a magnificent steak another spoons on Béarnaise
sauce and yet another piles exquisite pomme frite on the plate JEAN-DO
makes the first cut and the knife slides down the steak as if going through
butter Then he tucks in hungrily eating at terrific speed cleaning up the
juice on the plate with a chunk of bread

An enormous cheese trayis produced JEAN-DO points to five assorted
cheese which are served to him He eats and drinks

He eats an enormous exaggerated soufflé and drinks a sweet wine

JEAN-DO

Beside this drawing are five dashes for the word the second dash has an
‘A’ and the lasta‘Y’

dune facing the others as though she were on a stage She cartwheels and
cavorts while she sings

songs think Papinou teaches her

THEOPHILE
She shows off Pop Tell her to stop

Not far away the chapel clock chimes
After a moment

THEOPHILE
When can we go home

The clock finishes chiming
Silence but for the sound of the sea and distant laughter

SYLVIE
Go and change Céleste time to go home
soon

The children go to change out of their swimming costumes leaving JEAN-
DO and SYLVIE alone

JEAN-DO swivels his head to see the tide receding and some bathers far
out just dots Other are leaving the beach trudging homeward

He turns his head to her SYLVIE takes hold of his inerthand and holds it
tightly

He sees himself and then he sees tears running down from behind her
glasses

Animals song ends

‘The Kangaroo escaped the Zoo
“Goodbye zoo cried Kangaroo Cleared

The nurse leaves Jean-Do gazing at a bust of the Empress Eugenie
enclosed ina vitrine that reflects his own deformed image Wheelchairs
and gurneys come and go

JEAN-DO’S VOICE
Not only am exiled paralyzed mute half
deaf deprived of all pleasures and
reduced to the existence of a jellyfish
but am also horrible to behold There
comes a time when the heaping up of
calamities brings on uncontrollable
nervous laughter- when after a final blow
from fate we decide to treat itallas a
joke

Down the hallway Empress Eugenie wearing a hat with yellow ribbons
and carrying a silk parasol and a chattering flock of ladies-in-waiting
approach Jean-Do and appears behind him in the glass

Eugenie runs her fingers through his hair

EUGENIE

(gently)
There there my child you must be very

patient

The municipal band begins to play a waltz

Jean-Do’s face moves and he starts laughing Eugenie soon joins in
touches his face and she encourages him to stand up which he does

JEAN-DOS POV - HOSPITAL and SHORE

Against the sky the hospital He is seeing it seated in his wheel-chair from
a little way out at sea The great sprawling building the beach packed with
little specks of carefree bathers the sea and the cloudless sky

He turns his head to find CLAUDE with as usual her note book They are
on the deck ofa small fishing boat

TWO MALE NURSES near the prow smoking cigarettes They have a
cassette player which plays pop music (Lou Reed’s “Pale Blue Eyes”)

do you good

He blinks

JEAN-DO opens his eyes to see CLAUDE sitting opposite him a book in
her hands On the worn jacket THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO by
ALEXANDRE DUMAS’

CLAUDE
It’s not a first edition but it’s pretty old

She begins to recite the alphabet - and make notes - which insists itself and
fades as necessary

INT WAX MUSEUM - NIGHT

Great crashing chords on an organ

Nightmarish atmosphere Turn-of-the-century style distorting mirrors ina
distorted hall walls aslant narrow archways undulating ceiling And the
frightening music played on the organ at full blast

JEAN-DO glides through an arch sees himself distorted

JEAN-DOS VOICE
Talking about dreams is boring
especially other people’s dreams But
last night dreamt visited Paris’s wax
museum

He wanders towards another arch over which there is a sign
TODAY
He enters

There are only two wax models One is of DR MERCIER the
ophthalmologist grotesque leering with his hands covered in congealed
blood

The other is Monsieur Noirtier

As JEAN-DO passes them MERCIER winks and Monsieur Noirtier cackles
electronically

There’s yet another arch and over it the sign
A SURPRISE
BEATRICE and FEMALE NURSES all in outrageously sexy outfits

JEAN-DO’S VOICE (contd)
If only
As he passes BEATRICE crosses herself and one of the NURSES wiggles
her hips

Above the next arch the legend
TOMORROW

Itis an exact replica of his Room 119 but the photos and drawings are ill-
defined as if the wall melted

There is no one in the bed just a hollow in the middle of the yellow sheets

But surrounding the bed are wax models of DR LEPAGE and DR
COCHETON SANDRINE SYLVIE CELESTE THEOPHILE and CLAUDE

He weaves his way between them examining them closely SANDRINE
smiling SYLVIE with frozen tears on her cheeks the children smiling too
the others have their hands stretched out towards the hollow in the bed as if
in supplication or a benediction

Where the speaker-phone should be there is a lever with a sign
PULL ME

He pulls the lever and from the ceiling like confetti a great rain of paper
descends

Theyre the letters of the alphabet and they stick to the wax models and to
JEAN-DO in nonsensical order

Above the next arch the legend
YESTERDAY

Jean-Do sees himself sitting in a first class seat on an airplane All of the
other seats on the plane are empty A man Roussin approaches the
