As the film nears the end the CAMERA PULLS BACK A dozen
German officers are scattered in groups around a large day
room
Their faces reflect a mixture of emotions Some seem lost in
a kind of dream-like reverie as if to say Ah yes those
were the days Others appear mildly resentful A few are
plainly bored One dozes
CLOSE - LT KRAUS
A faint smile of mocking cynicism
CLOSE - LT DIETRICH

Deeply concentrated on film troubled

A meticulous corporal nurses the flickering lémm projector
as the film ends The lights snap on

FAVORING LT DIETRICH AND LT KRAUS

We see a mask of non-committal indifference cover the
emotions seen in the dark They stretch and light
cigarettes As the projectionist changes the reel there is
a low murmur of conversation around the room

LT KRAUS
(turns around to
projectionist)
What are we going to see tonight
Willy

PROJECTIONIST
Romance on the Danube sir

LT KRAUS
(mock seriousness)
But weve seen that seven
times Why dont you get us a
Betty Grable picture

ANOTHER OFFICER
Dont be so impatient Oskar
Thats all youll be seeing pretty
soon
CLOSE - LT DIETRICH
He pays no attention to conversation and seems depressed

SHOT - GROUP

Murmur of officers laughter A SERGEANT enters He salutes
in front of Lts Dietrich and Kraus

SERGEANT
The car is ready sir

LT KRAUS
So soon
(rises with Lt Dietrich)
Well gentlemen I hope you have a
splendid evening

They exit as the romantic strains of the Blue Danube Waltz
rattle out of the projector

EXT LONG SHOT OF BARRACKS - 10TH PARATROOPER REGIMENT - DAY
Before the war the buildings were a school They are
shuttered two-story stone barracks in two rows along a brick
street In the playing fields behind the barracks are
parachute training apparatus
At the end of the street is the headquarters building There
is a large Swastika over the door and a staff car and courier
bicycles parked outside

MAIN TITLES

DISSOLVE TO
EXT LONG SHOT DOWN ROAD - DAY
Two wrecked trucks burn with an oily yellow-black flame
Along each shoulder of the road a column of infantry trudges
wearily toward the camera They carry their weapons slung

over their shoulders and their machine guns high across their
backs
As the left hand column reaches the burning trucks they
skirt out on the road to avoid the heat and then move back on
the shoulder

A dot far down the road moves toward the camera As it
nears it is seen to be the camouflaged jeep

SLOW PAN - JEEP TROOPS BURNING TRUCKS

The driver is in front and Lieutenants Dietrich and Kraus are
in the back The troops pay no attention and do not look
either right or left Their heads are hunched on their
shoulders and steam rises in the cold air from their warm
bodies The driver eases the jeep past them The passengers
glance at the troops and the burning trucks and at two men
hanging from a tree

SHOT - TWO DESERTERS HANGING FROM TREE

There are cardboard signs hanging across their chests
indicating their crime

EXT ROAD - SHOT FOLLOWING THE JEEP - DAY

The road is elevated above wet fields on both sides The
driver slows as he nears a crowd of mixed soldiers and
civilians many obviously refugees The jeep creeps along
until motioned to a halt by a black-uniformed SS SERGEANT
with a swastika armband The jeep stops right in front of
him

DRIVER AND SERGEANT

SS SERGEANT
(giving an order)
Identification check Pull into
line on the left

The driver looks around to Lt Dietrich

LT DIETRICH
Sergeant

SS SERGEANT
Yes Oberlieutenant

LT DIETRICH
We are overdue in Karlstadt already
with these muddy roads

SS SERGEANT
You can move to the front of the
line sir The Captain can help
you

PAN SHOT - THE CHECKPOINT
An SS CAPTAIN is at the head of the column questioning each
person in turn Behind him two corporals with SMGS lounge

idly against the fenders of the truck

Herded into the back of the truck are about a dozen men in
uniform or civilian clothes They are dejected and scared

On a signal from the captain the corporals move in on a man
search him and shove him on the back of the truck

The captain waves up the next man just as the jeep eases up
to the front of the line

The SS officer looks up with mild interest as Lt Dietrich
gets out but goes back to his questioning of a private

Dietrich and Kraus light cigarettes and watch
SHOT OF CHECKPOINT - FAVORING SS CAPTAIN AND SIGNALMAN

SS CAPTAIN
Your papers

SIGNALMAN
Here they are sir Private Erich
Hovlund 7746539 the 124th
infantry

SS CAPTAIN
Where is your unit and why arent
you with them

SIGNALMAN
(without hesitation)
I believe theyre at Wurtzburg Im
trying to reach them

SS CAPTAIN
You believe Why havent you
reached them I see no leave
authorization

SIGNALMAN
I lost the company last night near
Gretsburg I took the wrong turn
coming from filling my canteen and
couldnt catch up in the dark

SS CAPTAIN
It must have been very dark You
seem to have strayed off your course
for Wurtzburg However
(tapping the papers)
You seem right on course for your
home in Koenigshofen

SIGNALMAN
No sir Im trying to get to
Wurtzburg

SS CAPTAIN

Undoubtedly but well hold you for
the moment until we can check with
your unit

(he turns toward the

truck)
Corporal Hartl put him in the
truck
VARIOUS SHOTS - ACTION SEQUENCE

As the corporal starts forward the private suddenly jumps
back into the crowd and dodges back down the road

The crowd stands quietly as he pushes them aside and knocks
one down in his hurry

The two corporals race after him They cannot fire because
of the crowd

The private jumps down the embankment to avoid the sergeant
heading him off

He starts across a muddy field towards a small woods

The machine gunner on the truck snaps his bolt several times
and the ejected rounds clatter on the truck roof in the
silence

Many of the crowd squat down The gunner pauses what seems a
long time as the private rushes desperately for the woods

He has almost made it when the gunner squeezes off a long
burst which follows the man slowly at first then catches up
holds him a long moment and stops abruptly The last rounds
crash loudly in the woods as the man skids in the mud on his
face and lies still

VARIOUS SHOTS OF THE CROWD

The crowd watches the dead body in silence They get back to
their feet Several shuffles back to the rear of the line

SS CAPTAIN AND LIEUTENANTS DIETRICH AND KRAUS

SS CAPTAIN
(gesturing to his men)
Keep them in line back there And
get the body

LT KRAUS
(unemotionally)
Sad but stupid He didnt weigh the
chances A man cant outrun a
machine gun

LT DIETRICH
(depressed indifference)
He was obviously a deserter or else
he wouldnt have run

SS CAPTAIN
(approaching)
Yes Oberlieutenant You wish to
pass through

LONG SHOT - MUDDY FIELD

The two corporals are splashing across the muddy field for
the body of the dead man
THREE SHOT
Dietrich watches

LT KRAUS
(with slight irony)
You have an exciting job here
Captain

The corporals have reached the body and are dragging it back

SS CAPTAIN
(following his gaze)
Yes That is regrettable But they
think the war is over

LT DIETRICH
Yes we wish clearance These muddy
roads are making us late in
Karlstadt

SS CAPTAIN
What is the nature of your business
in Karlstadt

LT DIETRICH
Of a personal nature sir

SS CAPTAIN
Im sorry but I must have a more
explicit answer

LT DIETRICH
We are going to visit the wife of a
comrade sir

SS CAPTAIN
(dirty laugh)
Nothing to be ashamed of
lieutenant We all need a little
relaxation now and then

LT DIETRICH
(coldly)

Do you wish to see our papers sir

Dietrich and Kraus exchange glances while the papers are
scrutinized

SS CAPTAIN
These are in order I am sorry to
have detained you lieutenant
They exchange salutes and drive off in the jeep
DISSOLVE TO

STREET IN KARLSTADT - LONG SHOT - DAY

Complete ruin Half shells of houses still standing The
street is plaster dust broken glass and rubble

Two boys are throwing stones at the house while a younger
girl sits on the curb watching and shouting comments at them

The jeep noses around the corner and haltingly moves through
the rubble in low gear

SHOT - JEEP AND CHILDREN

The jeep pulls up and Kraus and Dietrich get out slamming
the doors The children have been watching them in silence
all this time

LT DIETRICH

(to the children)
Do any of you know where
Elizabethstrasse 14 is

1ST BOY
(he points)
Thats it right in front of you

Dietrich looks at the house which is a burned-out hulk with
the top floor completely gone He starts to climb over the
rubble to go in

2ND BOY
Nobody is home I wouldnt go in
sir

LITTLE GIRL
(importantly)
I went in looking for Pauli and they
bit me The rats Two big ones

She sticks out her leg The bites are wrapped in a dirty
cloth

LT DIETRICH
(gently)
Do you know where Frau Koenig has
gone She used to live here

The children shake their heads

LT DIETRICH
She was tall and dark

The children look dumbly at each other
LT DIETRICH
She had a boy Klaus -- about your

age

One of the boys throws quickly at a rat in the rubble

2ND BOY
Did you see him Hans I almost got
him

1ST BOY

(suddenly remembering)
Yes sir I remember her She is
safe but I dont know where she
lives now Were the only ones left
on this street after last weeks
raid

His concern for Frau Koenig satisfied he allows the
depressing condition of the children to penetrate fully

LT DIETRICH
Can I give you some money

1ST BOY
(politely)
No thank you sir No one wants it
around here
(notices package under
Dietrichs arm)
Have you got any vodka

LT KRAUS
You cant be over ten You dont
drink it

1ST BOY

Sometimes sir But mostly we trade
it for food The soldiers like it

LITTLE GIRL
We used to get turnips at the
hospital but the sisters went away

Dietrich hands the boy the bottle wrapped in paper

1ST BOY
Thank you sir

LT KRAUS
Thats the best Yugoslavian
slivowitz Make sure they give you
a lot of food for it
(he musses the little
boys hair)
Lets go

1ST BOY

Dietrich turns back pauses then nods vacantly to the boy

They start down the stairs into a basement cafe

STREET PARTIALLY DAMAGED BY BOMBS - DUSK

Dietrich pulls out

A LUFTWAFFE

LIEUTENANT stumbles up the stairs drunk He bumps into
slips to one knee Dietrich pulls him up roughly

Dietrich

LT DIETRICH
(brusquely)
You are drunk Lieutenant Your
uniform is filthy I suggest you go
back inside and get yourself cleaned
up

LUFTWAFFE LT

(jerking away)
Your pretty uniform may impress the
girls but uniforms are going out of
style quicker than German heroes

(staggers up the sidewalk
Drunkenness is in style Herr
Oberlieutenant And your fine
medals will they get you a high
position in the coming Fourth Reich

LT DIETRICH
Lieutenant you are making a fool
out of yourself

LUFTWAFFE LT
(salutes drunkenly)
Go straight to hell Herr
Oberlieutenant

During this exchange the driver has come up

JEEP DRIVER
(to Dietrich)
Shall I have him placed under
arrest sir

CLOSE - DIETRICH

He is greatly agitated and obviously upset

LT DIETRICH
No let him go
(emotionally indignant)
Disgusting to see an officer make
such a fool of himself
LT KRAUS
Youre right -- but he is drunk

LT DIETRICH
That is no excuse
(spoken with child-like
conviction)
He should know that the uniform is
nothing but what the man inside
brings to it

LT KRAUS
Of course Paul Lets go inside

They enter the cafe

INT CAFE - VARIOUS SHOTS OF THE CAFE - EVENING

Smoke noise singing music and laughter Several men are
already passed out on the floor their heads resting on their
arms

PAGE MISSING

She kisses Kraus passionately and laughs Kraus wont let
her go She makes a mock protest and kisses him again

LT KRAUS
(as if incredulous at her
passion)

What have you been drinking
They sit

LISE
(hysterically cheerful
Everything and plenty of it But
thats not why Im so happy Four
days without a bombing Anda
Colonel told me the Americans are so
close there wont be any more

LT KRAUS
Aha I knew there was a master plan
behind our retreat

Lise laughs then screws her face into a thoughtful pose
She rests her chin in her hand

LISE
How close are they

LT KRAUS
(very serious)
I dont know exactly but I heard
they captured an American officer
outside the Cafe yesterday He was
nailing up a sign saying Off
Limits

LISE
How can you tease about such things
Oskar
LT KRAUS
Whos teasing

LISE
You may joke all you like but I
think were in for a hard time

LT DIETRICH
(sullenly)
You have nothing to worry about
Your talents will never go
unappreciated

Stops angrily her mood changes to icy dislike

LISE
Well well the high and mighty
Oberlieutenant Dietrich is finally
joining the party

LT DIETRICH
One never likes to interrupt such
witty and brilliant conversation

LISE
We will see just how high and mighty
Herr Oberlieutenant is when the
Americans get here

LT DIETRICH
(flushing anger)
Just what did you mean by that
remark

LISE
Nothing just wondering whether you
plan to sell apples or sweep the
streets

LT DIETRICH
(rises to leave)
Go to hell you ignorant little
whore

LT KRAUS
(grabs Dietrichs arm)
Come come children We are here
to have a good time Lets not
spoil everything

CLOSE - LT DIETRICH

Eyes downcast his anger changes into self-disgust

CLOSE - LISE

Regains her composure and realizes how deeply she has hurt
Dietrichs pride Brushing back her hair with a careless

gesture she smiles

LISE
I apologize Paul Its just that

misunderstanding Everyones

LT KRAUS
I propose a toast To the three of

twelve years of madness each in
their own way

LISE

thought Then Lise leans forward to Kraus confidentially

LISE
(nostalgically)
Its really lost isnt it

LT KRAUS
(smiles)
Of course And you can thank heaven
for that
LISE

How long until the end

LT KRAUS
A week maybe two at the most If
it isnt over by then it will be
the Americans against the Russians

LISE

(a bit drunkenly)
Its hard to believe its really

started We were all just kids

(sudden change of tone)
You know what I look forward to most
is soap Soap and hot water
Scalding hot water and soap

LT KRAUS
(pseudo-Valentino)
You dont have to wait until then
I have some soap and some matches

He exits A man in civilian clothes (GESTAPO AGENT) stands
up at the next table and follows him outside

EXT STAIRS TO CAFE AND STREET - NIGHT

There is a mist in the air Dietrich stops at the head of
the stairs and takes a deep breath The man in civilian
clothes appears behind him in the doorway

GESTAPO AGENT
One moment please Lieutenant

LT DIETRICH
Yes what can I do for you

He notices a drawn Luger in the mans hand

GESTAPO AGENT
(flashing card)
You are under arrest for being a
party to treasonous propaganda and
making defeatist and disloyal
statements

LT DIETRICH
You must be joking

GESTAPO AGENT
I assure you Im not

LT DIETRICH
But then this is completely
ridiculous

GESTAPO AGENT

GESTAPO AGENT

question

LT DIETRICH
I dont know who you mean

GESTAPO AGENT

GESTAPO AGENT
And the girl

LT DIETRICH
Shes with him
GESTAPO AGENT
You have a rare wit Herr
Oberlieutenant We shall see how it
holds up at headquarters Start
walking to the corner if you

VARIOUS QUICK CUTS

The agent has laid one hand on Dietrichs arm Suddenly
Dietrich stomps heavily backwards on the agents foot and
ankle hurting him painfully and throwing him backwards

Turning swiftly Dietrich pounds a vicious closed-fist judo
chop into the side of the agents neck Stunned he drops
heavily to his hands and knees

Dietrich gives him a brutal kick in the jaw with his boot
tumbling the agent over on his back in collapse

CLOSE - DIETRICH

Dietrich gets up His mouth is open and he pants loudly from
the adrenalin fear and exertion His face is in a sweat

He looks quickly around Dietrich pulls the agent to the
curb and tumbles him under a truck with a push of his boot

EXT NIGHT - JEEP PARKED IN AN ALLEY

His jeep is parked in a deserted alley just off a main
street Opening the front door Dietrich finds the driver
lying on the front seat wrapped in a blanket and asleep He
shakes him

LT DIETRICH
Wake up Soderbaum Come on wake
up

Soderbaum gets up with a start It takes his eyes a few
seconds to focus Seeing Dietrich he slides over behind the
wheel the blanket still around his shoulders Dietrich gets
in Soderbaum tries twice before getting the cold motor to
turn over

INT FRONT OF JEEP - DRIVER AND DIETRICH

INT HALLWAY AND STAIRS - NIGHT

cord from a chandelier Trash dirt and broken plaster are
everywhere Dietrich looks at the directory on the wall It
is obviously out of date but written on the wall in lipstick
with an arrow pointing to apartment 7 is the name Koenig
He starts up the stairs The rail is broken off

INT LANDING - NIGHT

Dietrich looks closely at one door in the dim light and then
at the other On the second he sees the impression of the
number 7 in the chipped paint He knocks on the door He
waits a moment and knocks again From within a womans
voice

WOMANS VOICE (0OS)
Just a moment Who is it

The door opens ANNA is a strikingly attractive woman in her
thirties Her full but slender figure is revealed under a
turtle-neck sweater and skirt

LT DIETRICH
Good evening Anna

ANNA

The apartment is shabby with broken furniture cracked
plaster and a single lamp

LT DIETRICH
Its so nice to see you again

(taking coat off)
Thats perfectly all right I am

ANNA
Im afraid thats not true But Im

LT DIETRICH
One of the girls at the Cantina told

More awkward moments

ANNA
Which girl

LT DIETRICH
Oh little Lise

ANNA
Yes I know her

LT DIETRICH
You were bombed out

ANNA
Yes fortunately it was a daylight
raid and we werent home I was

taking little Klaus to the doctor

LT DIETRICH
How is little Klaus

ANNA
He is much better now but he had a
terrible cough It kept him awake
at night for a week You know how
hard it is to get any medicine or
find a doctor

LT DIETRICH
Where is he now

ANNA
He is sleeping in the other room

Would you like to see him

LT DIETRICH
If it wont wake him up

FOLLOW SHOT - ANNA AND DIETRICH

on the floor No other furniture is in the room A wooden
crate and some sheets of newspaper complete the decor

FOLLOW SHOT
They watch him sleep then exit

LT DIETRICH
Hes a wonderful boy

ANNA
Yes and so much like his father

Some awkward beats Dietrich sits down again Silence
Anna folds her hands in her lap and smiles

ANNA
Why have you been such a stranger
lately

LT DIETRICH
My duties at the base have kept me
very busy

ANNA
You and Klaus are such good friends
We talk of you often

CLOSE - DIETRICH
He tries to find an approach to the subject
CLOSE - ANNA

She adjusts herself with great composure Starts to speak
then stops Thinks a moment and folds her hands

ANNA
(matter of factly)
You are here because of Klaus
arent you Something has happened

LT DIETRICH
(haltingly)
Yes he is dead Im sorry Anna
I should have been more direct

ANNA
It was not difficult to guess the
purpose of a visit at this hour

LT DIETRICH
I am terribly sorry Anna You have
my greatest sympathy

ANNA
Yes its tragic But Ive been
expecting the news ever since he
left five days ago

LT DIETRICH
Then you were prepared
ANNA
Yes one must In these times one
must be prepared for anything

As she speaks the last lines she accidentally knocks some

change off a table

pfennigs

she begins to cry Gently at first

wracking sobs

Anna gets

LT DIETRICH
I know what Klaus must have meant to
you

ANNA
(crying)
Klaus dead I almost cant believe
it

LT DIETRICH
You must remember he was a brave
man he died defending the
Fatherland

ANNA
The Fatherland What does it matter
now Klaus is dead

LT DIETRICH
In these times such men dont live
to an old age

ANNA
But what will I do now What will I
do without him

LT DIETRICH
Anna you must listen to me Iam
proud of Klaus and you should be
too Death is not such a tragedy
We will all be dead A few years
more or less should not be that
important What is important is
that he died honorably

ANNA
Thats easy for you to say

LT DIETRICH
I dont expect you to understand now
but someday you will

a handkerchief and blows her nose

ANNA
(sniffling)
Someday Thats the day we all wait
for Lets have a drink

LT DIETRICH
Id like to but Im afraid I must
be leaving If theres anything I

As she bends to pick up the scattered

then in great
CLOSE - ANNA
She smiles ruefully

ANNA
I wish you wouldnt leave just yet

CLOSE - LT DIETRICH
Thinks for a moment

LT DIETRICH
Well I guess I can stay for a
while

bottle

ANNA
I have some Steinhager left Is
that all right

LT DIETRICH
Excellent

ANNA
Water

LT DIETRICH
Nothing thanks

ANNA
Thats the way I like it too

She returns with two water glasses and the bottle and sits
down beside him She pours the Steinhager carefully They
both touch glasses

LT DIETRICH
To the memory of Klaus

They both toss the drinks down Anna utters a little
contented sigh as the drink warms her

ANNA
At least you are one of the lucky
ones

LT DIETRICH
(gloomily)
Yes I am one of the lucky ones

A few seconds pass

ANNA
(after a pause)
Another drink

LT DIETRICH
(kindly)
Thank you but I think I really
ought to be going

ANNA
Oh please Just one more

LT DIETRICH
(smiling)
All right

She pours two more She holds out her glass

ANNA
(ironically)
To the future

LT DIETRICH
(dismally)
To the future

They both toss the rather large drinks down in a single
motion She utters another warm sigh

ANNA
Talk to me about something

LT DIETRICH
What would you like to talk about

ANNA
Oh I dont know Tell me a funny
story

He thinks frowns and gives up

LT DIETRICH
Im afraid I have a very poor memory
for jokes

ANNA
It doesnt matter Lets have
another drink

She starts to pour and he puts his hand over the glass

ANNA
Oh dont be so stiff Take your
hand away

LT DIETRICH
(gently)
This must be the last one My
driver is sitting outside in the
cold

ANNA
Well send him away

LT DIETRICH
Then how will I get back to the

base

ANNA
You can take the bus

LT DIETRICH
It doesnt run at night

ANNA
Then you can take it in the morning

LT DIETRICH
(laughs)
Oh thats impossible I have no
place to spend the night in town

ANNA
(as if it were perfectly
obvious)
But you can spend it here if you

like

LT DIETRICH
(quizzical smile)
I couldnt very well do that

ANNA
(matter of fact)
I dont know why

LT DIETRICH
(awkwardly)
No it wouldnt be right

ANNA
Of course you could

LT DIETRICH
(smiles)
No thats impossible

ANNA
(snaps on a battered
phonograph)
Before you go then one dance And
no excuses

LT DIETRICH
(listens to the
sentimental tune)
All right

He takes her in his arms and they begin to dance He holds
her lightly and at a respectful distance The music plays
The smell of her perfume seems to disturb him He holds
holds her further apart

ANNA
(smiles)
You dont have to be afraid I
wont break

Lt Dietrich holds her closer She comes closer still

ANNA
That song brings back a lot of
memories

LT DIETRICH
Yes funny how music can do that to
you

They dance each absorbed in their own thoughts

ANNA
You must think Im a terrible
person

LT DIETRICH
Dont be silly

ANNA
(the drinks make her speak
with extra care)
You do I know that But then
theres so much about Klaus and
myself you dont know anything
about

She stops dancing and gives him a significant look

LT DIETRICH
(surprised)
Well yes I suppose there is

ANNA
(laughs ironically)
Youd really be surprised if you
knew

LT DIETRICH
I suppose every marriage has its
secrets

They start dancing again Then Anna suddenly embraces Paul
her face up to his

ANNA
Paul I want you to make love to me

LT DIETRICH
What

ANNA
I want you to make love to me I
want to feel a man in my arms

LT DIETRICH
You must be drunk

ANNA
Oh do you think a couple of drinks
has loosened me up Paul take me
in your arms and do anything you
want

LT DIETRICH
If youre not drunk you must be
insane
ANNA
Whats the matter You like women
dont you

LT DIETRICH
That has nothing to do with it

ANNA
I think it has everything to do with
it I like men and you like women
The rest is rather simple dont you
think

LT DIETRICH
Dont be disgusting You know what
I mean

ANNA
You mean we must respect the dead

LT DIETRICH
If you enjoy putting it that way

ANNA
Id much rather have you take pity
on a poor widow

LT DIETRICH
Anna

ANNA
Shall I tell you a secret

LT DIETRICH
Ive had fifty men better than you
this year

LT DIETRICH
Are you proud of that

ANNA
Im not ashamed of it

LT DIETRICH
Did Klaus know

ANNA
I was unfaithful but I wasnt
cruel

LT DIETRICH
He never suspected

ANNA
I made him completely happy

LT DIETRICH

Dietrich slaps her heavily in the face and she loses her
balance tripping backward over a lamp

Ha ha ha ha youve proven your

same

Dietrich stands stunned and amazed He walks slowly back to
Anna and helps her to her feet She brushes her hair back

EXT LONG SHOT OF 10TH PARATROOPER REGIMENT BARRACKS - DAWN
INT COL VON SPERLINGS OFFICE - DAWN

The office is very severe On one wall is a blackboard On
a second is a map rack

Behind the colonels plain desk are two framed pictures one
of Gen Kurt von Student the other of Gen Gerd von
Rundstedt

In the room are the colonels adjutant MAJOR GOSSWALD his
executive LIEUTENANT COLONEL PRAEGER his operations
officer MAJOR VON BREDOW CAPTAIN ABTMEYER Lt Kraus and
Lt Dietrich They are seated or standing around a table

There is a knock on the door and a guard hands a pitcher of
steaming coffee to Major Gosswald

SHOT - FAVORING DIETRICH

Dietrich crosses over to Captain Abtmeyer a haggard puffy-
looking giant of a man They exchange friendly ironic
glances

LT DIETRICH
(under his breath)
What do you think this is all about

CAPT ABTMEYER
(as if it is common
knowledge)
They are going to pull us back
They say the front is getting too
close

Dietrich looks down disgruntled Captain Abtmeyer offers
him a cigarette

SHOT - COLONEL VON SPERLING

The door is opened by a guard and COLONEL VON SPERLING
briskly strides into the room He is a wiry tall man in his
fifties Closed-cropped hair and the usual dueling scar
Everyone snaps to attention

COLONEL VON SPERLING
Please remain as you were
gentlemen

There is a momentary reshuffling of positions

COL VON SPERLING
I dont think it is necessary to go
into detail about the present
situation on the West Front The
Fuehrer has promised us victory and
we all have Im certain the
fullest confidence in the wisdom of
his efforts

CLOSE - LT DIETRICH

His attention wanders as Col von Sperling begins He has
heard these morale speeches many times before

COL VON SPERLING

Three days ago in the retreat from
Obernburg an important railway
bridge spanning the Main River was
ordered destroyed Our engineers
did not have sufficient time and the
bridge was captured by the
Americans They are pouring
supplies and motorized units across
the bridge 24 hours a day

(pauses for emphasis)
We have received the order to
destroy that bridge

VARIOUS QUICK SHOTS AROUND THE ROOM

Everyone seems mildly stunned The downcast eyes and
skeptical expressions tell the rest

CLOSE - KRAUS

He looks as if the death sentence had just been pronounced
He looks at Dietrich incredulously

CLOSE - DIETRICH

He is the exception As the details of the mission are
expounded he appears to come to life for the first time
Until now he has appeared mildly depressed with everything
and everybody His face takes on a new vigor and intensity
He listens closely
SHOT - INCLUDING ALL

COL VON SPERLING

We got the order in about midnight
I had you aroused as soon as von
Bredow had worked out the details

(he pauses and drinks)
We drop a special force of 50 men
tonight by parachute Captain
Abtmeyer you will lead the mission

There is another pause Everyone is expecting Capt
Abtmeyer to ask some pertinent questions on the raid

CAPT ABTMEYER
(explosively)
Sir if I can speak my mind

COL VON SPERLING
Certainly Captain

CAPT ABTMEYER
This mission is suicidal and futile
Not only will it drop the group
almost in the middle of the American
Third Army but for absolutely no
purpose

COL VON SPERLING
Yes go on Captain

CAPT ABTMEYER
It surely cant have escaped you
sir that the war is no more than
weeks from ending I can only
consider this mission a tragic joke
that will kill off my entire group

There is a significant silence The members of the colonels
staff pay strict attention to their coffee cups

COL VON SPERLING

(slowly)
Captain I do not doubt your
courage You have proven it many
times before However I want you
to consider carefully what I say

(pauses briefly)
This mission was ordered by our
superior headquarters I make no
value judgments on orders I receive
I see that they are carried out to
the best of my ability and the full
resources of my command

(softly)
I expect you to make no judgments
and do the same This mission is
assigned to your group and I order
you to carry it out

CAPT ABTMEYER
(without hesitation)
And sir I must again

COL VON SPERLING
(explosively interrupting)
Pause a moment and consider all the
possibilities Abtmeyer Dont let
a late night of drinking and a ready
mouth get you in trouble This is

no joke

ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING ABTMEYERS FACE

CAPT ABTMEYER
(pausing a moment to
satisfy von Sperling)
I realize the full seriousness
Colonel And I again refuse this
order This is a unique situation
in special times

COL VON SPERLING
(after a long pause to
Major Gosswald)
Call in the guards

Gosswald crosses opens the door and calls in the guards
They shuffle into the room ill-at-ease in the presence of
all the brass They are armed with sub-machine guns

COL VON SPERLING

(to the guards)
Men you are witnesses give your
names to Major Gosswald afterwards

(to Capt Abtmeyer)
Captain Abtmeyer you have refused a
direct order I consider this a
special situation the refusal of
an order under combat conditions

VARIOUS QUICK CUTS OF THE FACES IN THE ROOM
SHOT OF COL VON SPERLING FROM BEHIND ABTMEYER

COL VON SPERLING
I sentence you to be shot
immediately
(to Major Gosswald)
Major Gosswald I order you to carry
out this sentence as soon as
possible by the most humane means

CLOSE - ABTMEYER - HE IS STUNNED

A very short pause while the significance of this sinks in
Apparently he did not expect such a severe punishment

MAJOR GOSSWALD
(to the guards)
Fall back outside
(to Abtmeyer)
Will you please come with me
Captain
Abtmeyer has himself fully under control He refuses to
speak however not knowing what he would say His glance
crosses with that of Dietrich for a long moment as he turns
to leave He strides rapidly from the room Gosswald follows
him out and closes the door

SHOT - FAVORING DIETRICH

Several moments of silence Colonel von Sperling walks to
the window his hands clasped behind his back He turns and
begins abruptly

COL VON SPERLING
That is an unfortunate beginning
Oberlieutenant Dietrich Im putting
you in charge of the mission You
are the only man left who is capable
of commanding such a daring and
dangerous assignment

LT DIETRICH
(cannot conceal a note of

pride)
Yes sir May I ask a favor of the
Colonel

COL VON SPERLING
Certainly Dietrich

LT DIETRICH

May I ask the Colonel to reconsider
his execution order for Colonel
Abtmeyer He has been a brave
officer for three years in our
outfit It is not difficult to
understand a mans courage breaking
under such a strain

Tragic unnecessary to go

through the whole war and come to an
end like that

LT DIETRICH
And such a brave officer

LT KRAUS
At least he might have been a little
more clever about it

LT DIETRICH
He obviously didnt expect to be
shot

They walk in silence

LT KRAUS
He knew it was suicide to go I
guess he just decided to gamble on
von Sperlings kindness

anyone can do about it now And I
think wed better get going Weve
got lots to do

LT KRAUS

Paul Im not going along on this

LT KRAUS
On the contrary

Do you want to be shot like
Abtmeyer

LT KRAUS
I dont intend to be

What are you going to do Hand in

your resignation to von Sperling

LT KRAUS
It would not be difficult to
disappear

LT DIETRICH
Youd get as far as the first
checkpoint and theyd hang you from
a tree

LT KRAUS
Remember the time we hid for a month
dodging Russian patrols We could
strike out cross country and just
stay in the woods a few weeks until
the Americans come

Dietrich reflects for a moment and shakes his head

LT DIETRICH
I couldnt do something like that

LT KRAUS
Why in hell not

LT DIETRICH
It would be running away and leaving
someone else to do my lousy job

LT KRAUS
Paul dont talk like a child

LT DIETRICH
I would never be able to face myself

again

LT KRAUS
This is not the time for Wagnerian
poses

Dietrich speaks to his friend as though explaining something
to an uncomprehending child

LT DIETRICH
Whatever my personal sentiments may
be I am an officer I swore an
oath of allegiance It is my duty
to obey this order

LT KRAUS
Duty duty to whom To the madmen
who have brought nothing but shame
and ruin to our country

LT DIETRICH

Oskar we are friends There is no
one closer to my heart than you I
would give my life for you But
there is no point in trying to prove
you are right to me I will do
whatever I can to help you but I
cannot go with you

Silence They resume walking
LT KRAUS
You agree its suicide to go

LT DIETRICH
I would feel the same way if I did
but I dont think thats necessarily
the case

Lieutenant Kraus nods his head ironically

LT DIETRICH
You know it wouldnt be the same
this time without you along

LT KRAUS
Thats true then only one of us
would be killed

LT DIETRICH
At least you havent lost your sense
of humor Look if youve really
made up your mind not to go --

INT THE SUPPLY HOUSE - BRUGGEMANN AND KRAUS - DAY

The supply house is run like a store It has a large counter
where the men wait for their equipment to be brought to them
by the supply clerks from the racks chests bins and boxes
in which the various items are stored

As each man reaches the counter his officer either
BRUGGEMANN or Kraus finds his name on the team list and
reads off to the supply clerk the equipment for this man item
by item

As the supply clerk gets each item the lieutenant checks it
off his list The team sergeants flank the lieutenants
keeping the lines quiet and closed up

The men are stunned by the quantities of ammo and demolitions
they are getting they realize the mission must be a tough
one Much of the dialogue is carried on simultaneously as
the two teams draw equipment at the same time

There is a Gestapo agent outside
checking on a murder of another
agent last night in Karlstadt This
agent was last seen following an
officer of this command from the
Cafe Wein He was found outside in

in and otherwise badly beaten

COL VON SPERLING
Please be responsible in a softer
voice Lieutenant

LT DIETRICH
Yes sir An agent from the Gestapo
tried to arrest me last night as I
was leaving the Cafe Wein In the
resulting fight I may have been
responsible for his death

COL VON SPERLING
(gazing out window)
Why did he want to arrest you

He accused me of making politically
disloyal statements

Colonel von Sperling inscrutably taps a pencil on his desk
wrapped in thought

COL VON SPERLING
Please show in Herr Grauschmidt

Kraus gives Dietrich a look as if to say Why in hell did
you have to admit that

MAJOR GOSSWALD
Yes sir
(speaking to someone
offscreen)
The Colonel would like to see you
again sir

Gosswald holds the door for the Gestapo agent He is a fat
cherubic looking German in a suit and heavy belted coat

HERR GRAUSCHMIDT
(he has little love for
von Sperling)
I see you waste little time Colonel
von Sperling

Colonel von Sperling forces an insincere smile bows his head
slightly in ironic deference

HERR GRAUSCHMIDT
(he bows and smiles to the
lieutenants)
The colonel explained to me that you
are preparing for a mission and that
your time is tightly scheduled

COL VON SPERLING
Your time is valuable also I
suspect Herr Grauschmidt Ill get
right to the matter It is as I
suspected

Lt Dietrich stiffens After von Sperlings harshness with
Abtmeyer he fully expects to be turned over to the Gestapo

COL VON SPERLING
Yes It is as Capt Abtmeyer
admitted prior to his execution this
morning These officers left him in
the canteen or immediately outside
it Lt Dietrich tells me that
Abtmeyer was not himself and was
showing him a propaganda leaflet
The fact that he refused a direct
order this morning indicates that he
was under a severe mental strain

The Gestapo agent does not appear to believe him but is
powerless to press anything further

HERR GRAUSCHMIDT
(bowing his head)
Thank you Colonel I am extremely
sorry but I shall have to file a
full report on this
(a veiled threat)

COL VON SPERLING
(to Dietrich)
Do not mistake my lie just now for
sentimentality As an Army man I
have no love for the Gestapo and I
have no interest in political
matters or opinions The only thing
that concerns me is my duty and your
ability to carry out your orders
You are one of the best officers in
the unit and you are too important
at the moment to be handed over to
those pigs

walks to the picture of General Kurt Student He stands
before it as if expecting an expression of sympathy from a

The field has been bombed recently There are several burned
and damaged aircraft pushed off to the edge of the concrete
strip and the strip itself is damaged
The hangers and the maintenance and operations buildings are
well-camouflaged with nets Several pairs of anti-aircraft

machine guns and one flak gun are dug-in in the vicinity

LONG SHOT DOWN AIRSTRIP

Five lorries roll down the airstrip and pull up under a
camouflage net outside an empty hanger

With shouts of the sergeants and slamming of truck gates the
men jump off the rear and file into the hanger They are
heavily ladened with weapons and equipment and in full battle
gear Their boots make a pounding sound on the concrete

DISSOLVE TO
INT AFTERNOON - INSIDE THE HANGER

The men are seated on the hanger floor They have taken off
their gear and are leaning against it and cradling their
weapons between their legs

In the front Dietrich is conferring with Bruggemann and
Kraus Behind him is a reversible blackboard on a stand

A staff car pulls up outside the hanger and Colonel von
Sperling and his staff get out they enter the hanger

The men spring to their feet and stand rigidly at attention
Col von Sperling and his staff walk to the rear of the men
Their steps echo hollowly in the hanger When and only when
he has reached the rear does von Sperling put the unit at
ease

COL VON SPERLING
At ease men

The men sit back down with an undertone of talking and
shuffling as they settle themselves

COL VON SPERLING
You may begin the briefing
Lieutenant

LT DIETRICH
We were just starting sir

Dietrich moves to the blackboard and looks briefly at notes
on his clipboard he is without nervousness obviously in his

element

LT DIETRICH

All right give me your attention

(the hushed conversations

cease)
D Group has been selected for a
night parachute drop and a bridge
demolition in the Obernburg-Main
River area

(he pauses)
Take-off will be at 1900 hours and
the drop at 2100 There will be
three planes with twenty men in
each

SHOT - THE MEN LISTENING

Bruggemann Kraus and the sergeants are taking occasional
notes

One man is oiling the bolt of his SMG by rubbing it across
the bridge of his nose

Another gently hones his killing knife on the sole of his
boot

In the rear the colonel and his staff listen intently

NOTE The briefing will be visually interesting Ample

drawings photographs and models will be employed The goal
of this scene is to make the audience understand the details
of the mission so when it later unfolds they feel a sense

of participation
ANOTHER - LT DIETRICH AT THE BLACKBOARD

LT DIETRICH
Pay attention to this Especially
you Masserman The last jump you
had to ask directions from the
Russians

There is an undercurrent of guffaws
LT DIETRICH

This is what the drop zone looks
like

(he draws an arrow)
The planes will fly from East to
West The assembly area is in the
south-east corner on the high ground
here The sergeants will show you
all the aerials afterwards

(he points to the board)
I want a rapid silent assembly It
will be night and the darkness will
give us a big edge in surprise

Dietrich glances at his clipboard

LT DIETRICH
The drop zone is about eight
kilometers from the target bridge so
that if we lose security it wont
disclose the objective
(he flips the blackboard)
Heres the way it looks The
sergeants have maps and will show it
to you afterwards
(he draws rapidly)
The Main River runs here Sort of
North-South The bridge is here
Near Obernburg The drop zone is
north of the bridge and on the east
of the river here It should take
us not more than three hours to get
from the drop zone to the bridge
(he looks at his

clipboard)

Here are the enemy dispositions in
the bridge area

SHOT - THE MEN LISTENING

As Dietrich reads from his list the men glance at each other
in surprise and dismay as the list grows formidably long
Bruggemann has a grin on his face but Kraus looks a little
sick The officers in the rear are non-committal

ANOTHER ANGLE - DIETRICH
Dietrich finishes the list and pauses

LT DIETRICH
Thats part of the American Third
Army rear echelon and mobile
reserve But theyve got bigger
things on their minds than us
Weve got a small enough group to
slip through and a big enough one to
handle anything coming our way

Dietrich flips the blackboard back over It still has the
drawing of the drop zone on it He tears off a sheet of

paper from his clipboard and scrubs most of the drawing off

LT DIETRICH
Heres what the bridge area looks
like

(he draws rapidly)
This is the road to Obernburg Now
the immediate area of the bridge is
defended by a company of combat
engineers who also maintain the
span They have about two hundred
men on top of the cliffs at road bed
level

SHOT - THE MEN

One man has fallen asleep A sergeant reaches over and gives
him a thump on the head He wakes up with a start and looks
a little guilty

ANOTHER ANGLE - LT DIETRICH

LT DIETRICH

(pointing as he goes

along)
The bridge spans a deep ravine and
the lower abutments are sunken into
the face of the rock walls about two
hundred feet above the bottom of the
ravine

(using pointer to

illustrate each feature)
This is in our favor since we
believe the bridge is only guarded
from the top By day the area below
can be well protected from the high
vantage point and by night it is
assumed the rock walls are
impossible to climb Our job is
going to be to show the Americans
what we learned in our Alpine
weekends

CUTS TO THE MEN

They look skeptical about the sheer climb
FAVORING DIETRICH

He smiles confidently

LT DIETRICH
When the mission has been completed
we will infiltrate our way back
through the lines in small groups
Do you have anything to add
Colonel

COL VON SPERLING
(said simply and with
sincerity)
No Lieutenant You did an
excellent job I would like to take
this opportunity to wish you all the
best of luck
He nods to Dietrich

LT DIETRICH
Following this briefing each squad
will be briefed in detail by their
squad leaders Then there will be
hot rations I guarantee no ersatz

hour and fifteen minutes

DISSOLVE TO
INT THE OPERATIONS ROOM - DAWN

The pilots are sitting around drinking coffee with the
Luftwaffe lieutenant colonel they are laughing and joking
Obviously the tension is off The colonel is reading a radio
dispatch As Dietrich comes up von Sperling motions Major
von Bredow over
LT DIETRICH
(saluting)
You sent for me sir

COL VON SPERLING

You can get your men ready Lt
Dietrich The weather has cleared
in the drop zone

(glancing at his watch and

the clock)
Its 0624 now Station time will be
0650 and take-off at 0700

QUICK CUTS - THE PERSONNEL
In stunned astonishment
ANOTHER ANGLE - THE OPERATIONS ROOM

LT DIETRICH
(seems almost relieved)
Yes sir

COL VON SPERLING
There are undoubtedly many
disadvantages But at least they
wont be expecting any attack and
especially in daylight

LT COLONEL
(coming over hurriedly)
I cant believe Colonel von
Sperling that you plan to go
through with this mission in the
daylight

COL VON SPERLING

Colonel my instructions were to
destroy this bridge nothing was
said as to the proper time of day

(he pauses)
Instruct your pilots to re-plot for
a one-leg pass at the drop zone with
a low level approach at 250 meters
If they hedge-hop they shouldnt be
much bothered by ground fire or
fighters Station time is 0650 and
take-off at 0700 hours

The Luftwaffe officer turns away without a word and begins
conferring with his pilots

COL VON SPERLING
(to Dietrich)
You will probably lose security
before you reach the bridge
Reroute so that the Americans wont
discover the objective by plotting
your route

LT DIETRICH
Yes sir
DISSOLVE TO
EXT AIRSTRIP IN FRONT OF THE HANGER - DAY

The men are formed up in teams under the camouflage net in
front of the hanger They are talking quietly and joking
The tension is off

Dietrich comes out of the operations building and walks to
the front of the formation rapidly He looks around

LT DIETRICH
(in command voice)
Sergeants reform the men into their
plane loads And move them over to
the trucks to draw chutes

There is a moment of silence as the men and NCOs grasp the
situation Then the sergeants begin to shout out orders and
the men scramble back into plane load formation

The trucks with the chutes pull around in front and the
sergeants begin to move the men by to draw the bag containing
a back pack and reserve

Bruggemann and Kraus come rushing up

LT KRAUS
They cant be meaning to drop us
now

The group of pilots and navigators with Col Bleuler leave
the operations room

LT DIETRICH
(ignoring them)
They are flying a straight route to
the drop zone Drop altitude 250

meters You wont need reserves
Have the men leave them by the
planes

(he checks his watch)
Have them in the planes at 0650
Take-off ten minutes after

(he looks at them)
Make sure you tell your plane loads
the new route azimuths

He slaps Kraus on the back and shakes his hand Then
Bruggemanns

LT DIETRICH
Good luck See you on the drop

zone

They salute and all run to their plane loads The men have
almost finished drawing chutes

DISSOLVE TO
ANOTHER ANGLE

The planes have started up and taxi in front of the hangers
in line

They stop The men file over to their planes
staggering under the double loads of chutes and battle gear
They plop down their chutes

He unzips the bag and pulls out the reserve then the back
pack He untwists and straightens the harness carefully
spreading out the straps and checking the chute
automatically He picks it up and Sgt Stange takes it from
him Dietrich turns and shrugs into it like an overcoat As
he buckles it in front Sgt Stange tucks in a few stray
edges of canopy

Stange leads off and the stick files to the rear of the
plane One by one they struggle up the steps helped by the
man in the rear who holds their weapon and pushes

The engines are idling with a throaty rumble The pilot
leans out the window and shouts something to Dietrich smiling
all the while

Dietrich smiles and waves He looks at his watch once before
loading on Stange pulls him up

The crew chief leans out and unhooks the ladder pulling it
in He shuts the door

INT PLANE
In the dim light the men are jamming themselves into the

narrow canvas seats and struggling to find their seat belts
The quarters are cramped and hot

Stange moves down the aisle checking the seat belts on one
side then back up checking the other side He takes his
seat and fastens his belt

The plane stops with a lurch The pilot begins to run up his
engines

EXT LONG SHOT OF AIRSTRIP AND THE THREE PLANES - DAY

The three planes are canted to the runway running up their
engines The first plane eases off and taxis onto the end of
the strip pointing down the runway Setting his brakes he
revs up

The chief moves forward toward the pilots compartment
Dietrich reaches up and attaches his static line to the
anchor line cable

INT PLANE - ANOTHER ANGLE

Dietrich grabs the handle of the door Bracing one foot
against the wall of the plane he cracks the suction and
pulls open the door The wind rushes in Pushing the door
as far to the rear as it will go Dietrich reaches behind it
and latches it firmly open Grabbing tightly to both sides
of the door he leans out to look The wind ripples his face
weirdly and whips fiercely at his clothes

seats and are lying on the floor

Most have their eyes closed trying to rest

Some near the door look out at the ground One man is
sharpening his killing knife even now But most have their
eyes closed The engines drone on

Sgt Stange gets to his feet and lurches down the aisle He
stops by Lt Dietrich who is studying the map Leaning one

hand on the wall of the plane for balance he bends down and
shouts to Dietrich

SGT STANGE
How much longer Lieutenant

LT DIETRICH
Its hard to tell Sergeant Stange
Probably another thirty minutes

SGT STANGE
Its hot as hell back there Im
going to try a little air

He hooks up and leans out the door The wind beats in
against him making a roaring sound in the door
The flight chief opens the door from the pilots compartment
and comes out He steps over the men on the floor and comes
down to Dietrich He flashes ten fingers twice Then he
sits down on his seat

Stand up and hook up

The men struggle to their feet and shuffle around until they
have some room They hook their static lines to the cable
running down the center of the planes ceiling The men on
the right hold the hook in their left hands The men on the
left hold it in their right

The man behind Dietrich in line tugs at his jacket Dietrich
looks around and sees the flight chief holding up one finger
He steps back into the plane for a moment and raises a
clenched fist in an encouraging salute to the men and steps
back into the door

SHOT - DIETRICH

Dietrich coils himself in the door His hands are flush
against the outside his head up his knees flexed his body
straight Suddenly the light flashes green and the bell
rings in a continuous chilling clamor Dietrich springs and
is carried away The next man pivots blindly into the door
and is gone

VARIOUS SHOTS - THE MEN FALLING FROM THE PLANE

The men are coiled in a bent position against the opening
shock The prop blast sweeps them back as they fall Their
static line pulls out the chute It stretches out until it
breaks away from the static line Then the blast whips it
back and it cracks open jerking the man He swings down
under the canopy The three planes are laying men behind
them like a fish lays roe

SHOT - FROM THE GROUND - THE THREE STICKS APPROACHING

SHOTS - DIETRICH FROM THE GROUND AND AIR

There is a great stillness except for an occasional rustle or
crack of a canopy Dietrich approaches the ground His feet
are apart legs flexed He saws back and forth on opposite
risers to keep his chute from oscillating dangerously

He hits the ground with a thump sinking to his knees and

bouncing back to his feet He grabs his settling canopy in
great armfuls He drops to the ground on one knee on top of
it

Tearing at his buckles he gets out of his chute Several
more jumpers crumple around him

He works the bolt on his SMG several times to make sure its
working and then trots towards the edge of the field

VARIOUS SHOTS - MEN LANDING IN THE FIELD

In the stillness the men land with a loud crump Some make
upright landings

Others coming in on a backwards drift or oscillation land
head over heels

One man injures himself landing with a partially-opened
canopy he is being dragged across the drop zone with a wind-
filled canopy when another jumper runs across the path and
grabs the chute even before he gets out of his own harness

LONG SHOT - ANOTHER ANGLE

The men are beginning to move off the drop zone at a crouched
trot their weapons at the ready The sergeants are
motioning them to move faster All is ominously silent
except for the panting of the men

stretches in a long line ready to go Some are standing
others squat The men are alternately faced right and left
for security

The lieutenants are squatting on their heels around a map

trees and a slight mist is rising from the damp ground It
is caught by the bushes and clings to the ground

LT DIETRICH
Keep it at 115 degrees until I
change it And check each other
And dont shoot unless you have to
He motions them forward They take one more look at the
compasses and move out about twenty yards before Dietrich
starts after them

He glances behind him at the MG team

They follow him The gunner shifts the gun which is across
his shoulders like a yoke the belt of ammo hangs down across
his chest

The men follow Dietrich They push aside the bushes with
their hands Behind the MG team is Sgt Stange and the
assault team They each have their SMGs ready hanging
loosely from one shoulder

Following the last of the assault team is Lt Bruggemann
He is leading the heavily ladened demolition team They
strain forward under the weight of the explosives

They nod and Dietrich scrambles back
DIETRICH AND PATROL

Dietrich half stands He raises his arm and pumps it once
Then he motions off to the left The patrol flanks left
moving at a crouch as silently as possible

SHOT - THE PATROL

Suddenly several rifle shots crack out followed by a short
burst of BAR fire The patrol squats immediately
disappearing below the level of the bushes The shots crash
in the trees behind them and the noise rolls in echoes across
the small valley

LT KRAUS
I thought that drop zone looked
different As if it wasnt bad

know where were going

Dietrich looks up sharply and breaks into the conversation
abruptly

LT DIETRICH

SHOT - THE ROAD - MOTOR CONVOY

Around the northern curve of the road 400 yards away rolls a
jeep followed by a truck

In the back of the truck are about fifteen American foot-
soldiers Mounted on the cab roof is a 50 cal MG manned and
ready against planes

Following the first truck at regular intervals is an entire
convoy They keep coming around the curve THE CAMERA PULLS
BACK UP THE SLOPE UNTIL IT CONTAINS THE PATROL

SHOT - THE OFFICERS AND STANGE (RAIN)

The trucks keep coming It starts to rain gently The
patter of rain on the leaves combines with the swish of tires
on the now wet road and the engine noise The trucks now tow
artillery

SGT STANGE

head)
That must be an entire mechanized
division and its artillery

LT BRUGGEMANN

It is now raining steadily The road is clear The lines of

men are standing silently in the rain Dietrich is placing
the second MG in position to cover the road during the
crossing He points and the MG team goes in place
SHOTS

The first line moves down the hill and up to the edge of the
embankment crouching and ready Behind them the second wave
waits to go into position

SHOTS

There is a long tense silence as everyone listens for
approaching trucks Everything is silent No trucks
Dietrich waves his hand forward and the first wave led by
Kraus and Stange drops over the embankment Immediately the
second wave falls into position behind them

SHOTS - THE FIRST WAVE ON THE ROAD

They slide down the muddy embankment into the near drainage
ditch Slipping and falling in the greasy red mud they
scramble out onto the road and pound across leaving red mud
tracked on the black asphalt road The rain begins to melt
it into a red stain

They scramble up the far embankment The rain has made it
very slippery and many fall back

Some leap clear across the far ditch and stick right in the
bank kicking toe holds and clawing up

SHOTS

From around the curve comes the back fire of an approaching
truck Several men are still floundering in the ditch Men
reach down and give them hands up Stange reaches down and
grabs up the last man by the scruff of his uniform and hauls
him bodily up into the bushes just as the truck clears the
corner

truck skids slightly on the mud and rolls on The driver is
concentrating on the road It disappears around the south
curve

SHOT - THE ROAD

The rain starts a sudden fierce noisy downpour It
splatters heavy drops on the asphalt Suddenly the second
wave bursts out of the bushes and leaps down the embankment
They stumble across the ditch and out on the road

QUICK CUT - THE NORTHERN CURVE

A jeep rounds the curve followed quickly by another They
are a motorized patrol The noise of the rain has concealed
their approach Both are open and mounting a 50 cal MG on a
pedestal mount Each carries a driver scout gunner and
assistant gunner
QUICK CUT - THE SECOND WAVE

The Germans see the jeeps and dive across the road into the
far ditch

QUICK CUT - THE JEEPS

The first jeep sees the men crossing It tries to stop but
skids in the mud and spins off the road to the left The
second jeep stops The gunner opens fire

SHOT - THE SECOND JEEP - 100 YARDS AWAY

Fire from the second jeep plows the embankment behind the men
in the ditch preventing them from moving

SHOT - BRUGGEMANN AND THE MG TEAM

Bruggemann jerks the MG gunner up and helps him jam his gun

into firing position shouting to get the jeep on the road

The gun opens up Its fire is high but it draws the 50 cal
fire

SHOT - THE FIRST JEEP IN THE DITCH

The first jeep is stuck in the mud The driver races the
engine and tries to jockey it out but it sinks deeper The
gunner opens fire and the others roll off into the ditch
The rounds ricochet off the asphalt and scream off into the
woods across the road

SHOT - DIETRICH IN THE DITCH

Dietrich scramble crab-like up the ditch towards the second
jeep He cradles his SMG in his left hand and plucks out a
grenade with his other He gets part way to the jeep before
the scout in the front seat spots him

SHOT - THE JEEP

The scout fires at Dietrich with his carbine The jeeps
wheels scream as the driver gives it the gas but the
traction is bad on the rain-slick pavement and the jeep slews
sideways before it can build up speed

SHOT - DIETRICH

Stange has finally gotten the first MG into action It opens
fire From the rear of the gun THE CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE
UNTIL IT IS LOOKING ALONG THE AXIS OF SIGHT The first burst
is off to the right The gunner shifts the burst onto the
jeep and holds the fire on it THE CAMERA MOVES FORWARD
TOWARD THE JEEP The rounds chew up the jeep and splatter in
the mud embankment behind it The gunner is killed
instantly THE CAMERA MOVES CLOSER Suddenly the jeep
explodes a tracer igniting the gasoline from the ruptured
gas tank

Bruggemann is pushing the MG team up the bank They hand up
the wounded

The prisoner is shoved up the bank by Bruggemann Two men
lie dead in the ditch Another of the wounded dies as he is
being passed up the embankment They lay him down gently in
the mud

Dietrich is shouting for them to clear the road he urges
them with vigor He and Bruggemann are the last to leave

Several men pull them up

SHOT - THE ROAD

The road is quiet except for the burning roar of the
gasoline The area is a mess of broken equipment tracked
mud and smoke The dead lie quietly in the ditch or on the
road

EXT THE PATROL MOVING IN THE WOODS UP THE SLOPE - DAY

The patrol is moving at a fast pace Dietrich drops back
along the column to urge the men forward faster They are
moving at almost a trot He races back towards the front

He is carrying one of the MGs plus his own weapon They are
moving up a long wide wash that is clogged with brush

There are rocks of a dried-up water course underfoot In
many places they are concealed with a matting of leaves The
rain is no longer falling but the sky is threatening

SHOT - THE MEN

Their mouths are open gasping for breath Their uniforms are
steaming from their body heat They pay attention to nothing
but the ground underfoot and the steps of the man in front
Their only thought is to keep up the pace

SHOT - BRUGGEMANN AND PRISONER

In the middle of the column Bruggemann is pushing the
prisoner ahead of him The American is hurt from his wounds
and in a daze at being captured so unexpectedly He slips on
a rock and Bruggemann quickly pulls him up by his belt

SHOT - DIETRICH AND WOUNDED MEN

Dietrich is helping one of the wounded German up the wash by
the seat of his pants The man bleeds to death from a wound
in his neck and in the rush and falls face down The men
behind them pass around as Dietrich bends down and turns him
over The man is staring straight ahead his face is very
white under the grime He is a demo man Dietrich unbuckles
his demo pack shifts the MG to one shoulder and swings the
pack over the other He closes the mans eyes with a sweep
of his hand Standing up he turns to the stragglers in the
rear

LT DIETRICH

The members of the patrol are widely deployed in various
attitudes of alert exhaustion Some men are still straggling
up Stange is in the rear of them encouraging them on and
half-carrying a wounded man He reaches the top and gently
lowers him to the ground The wounded man begins to gingerly
unlace his boot Dietrich calls Stange over

LT DIETRICH

hair and eyebrows are singed

LOW ANGLE - DIETRICH ABOVE MEDIC AND PRISONER

MEDIC

(exits)

LT DIETRICH
Good morning Corporal Scott
Feeling pretty under the weather I

CORPORAL
Im not complaining

Dietrich places the mans personal belongings on the ground
The prisoner tries to resist the temptation to grab them
eagerly With a studied casual air he stuffs them back into
his pockets

LT DIETRICH
Youll find everything untouched

CORPORAL
Thanks

LT DIETRICH
I must pay you a compliment

corporal

CORPORAL
Oh

LT DIETRICH
Very few men would have been able to
experience what you have just gone
through with as few ill effects as
you have

CORPORAL
I wish my lieutenant could hear
that

LT DIETRICH
(laughs cordially)
Like a cigarette

CORPORAL
Thanks

They both light up Dietrich exhales as if he has nothing to
do but sit and chat

LT DIETRICH
(charmingly)
Dont say it I admit your American
cigarettes are much better but they
are rather difficult to buy just
now

CORPORAL

(grudgingly laughs)
Say I know youre supposed to be
asking the questions but do you mind
if I ask you one

LT DIETRICH
Certainly not Besides please
dont regard this as an
interrogation

CORPORAL
Well then what in the hell is going
on -- another invasion

LT DIETRICH
(laughs amiably)
I should say happily not We were
cut off from our outfit in the
retreat Wednesday and were trying
to make our way back

CORPORAL
(weighting the truth of
Dietrichs statement)
Why dont you guys just call ita

prisoners of course

CORPORAL

CORPORAL

to bring help back

CORPORAL
The battalion aid station is about
four miles up the road I guess I

back with some transport pretty
quick

Dietrich had hoped to hear the name of a town
LT DIETRICH

(smiling)
That sounds wonderful corporal I
hope its set up near a town where
these men can get some first-class
treatment

CORPORAL
Dont worry about that Theyll get
the best

A momentary pause then Dietrich forces a smile

LT DIETRICH
Fine fine You know its
amazing theres anything left of our
towns You Yanks really did a
thorough job on them

CORPORAL
Yeah thats true

LT DIETRICH

Say I just happened to remember I
hope that town isnt Obernburg The

headquarters is that artillery had
that scheduled for a heavy
concentration

CORPORAL
No Obernburg is north of here The
hospitals safe enough Its ina
little dinky village called
Mungersdorf

SHOT - SGT STANGE AND LT BRUGGEMANN

Bruggemann is cleaning his weapon Stange stands as Dietrich

comes over grinning
cannot hear

He speaks softly so that the prisoner

LT DIETRICH

Lets see a

map I should have been

in an intelligence interrogation

section I

d be a major by now

(he spreads out the map
eagerly)

Mungersdorf

I though so Its
close by the bridge The road we
crossed runs south from it and
parallels the Main We crossed
about fourteen kilometers south on
the road which is about there

They edge over to see where he is pointing

LT DIETRICH
And heres our present position on
this hill two kilometers west of
the road

LT BRUGGEMANN
(glancing at his watch)

SHOT - THE PRISONER
The prisoner looks up quickly and then looks down again
REVERSE - THE LIEUTENANTS

They all rise Bruggemann has a disgusted look on his face
Dietrich is restraining his anger and Kraus looks white

LT DIETRICH
(under his breath)
In one day you seem to have lost all
the experience you have gained in
four years of war

LT KRAUS
Im sorry Paul I wasnt thinking
I was careless

LT DIETRICH
Thats fine What are we supposed
to do with the prisoner now

LT BRUGGEMANN
We certainly cant release him

LT KRAUS
Well I guess well have to take him
along with us

LT DIETRICH
(softly)
Dont add stupidity to your
carelessness That would be
impossible We will have to shoot
him

LT KRAUS
You cant do that

LT DIETRICH
I suggest you lower your voice You
have made enough trouble already

LT KRAUS
(in a lower tone)
There must be another way

LT DIETRICH
I am only doing what is necessary to
protect the lives of our own men

LT KRAUS
Paul in the name of God dont do
it

LT DIETRICH
Your carelessness is the cause of
the prisoners death just as well as
the bullet that kills him

Kraus glares at Dietrich unable to express his anger

LT DIETRICH
(softly but with great
menace)
Oskar try to regain control of your
nerves Try to remember you are an
officer Try to remember I am in
command

CLOSE - KRAUS

He stares in bewilderment at his friend for several seconds
then turns and walks away

TWO SHOT - DIETRICH AND BRUGGEMANN
Sgt Stange approaches

SGT STANGE

(he exits)

The patrol moves out
DISSOLVE TO

EXT FAVORING KRAUS - THE PATROL DISPERSED THROUGH THE
FOREST - DAY

Just the forest sounds Each man intently studying the
foliage in front of him A single shot suddenly echoes and
reverberates through the forest Everyone freezes After
some seconds Lieutenant Bruggemann and two men come puffing
into view from the rear

LT BRUGGEMANN
(as he passes through)

The prisoner tried to attack us and

we had to shoot him
Orders are given to move out They move

DISSOLVE TO

EXT LONG SHOT - SLOW PAN - MID-AFTERNOON
THE CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES FROM FAR LEFT TO FAR RIGHT AND BACK
AGAIN as if the area were being scanned by a scout The
wooded hills have stopped as the terrain slopes down toward
the Main River

In front is an open valley

Both hillsides are completely cleared and plowed for spring
planting

They slope down to a small dry stream bed edged on both sides
by a narrow band of trees and bushes

This stream is the beginning of the gully leading to the
Main It offers the only covered route across the bare
fields

SHOT - DIETRICH BRUGGEMANN AND KRAUS

They are standing on the edge of the woods The patrol
stretches behind them squatting or kneeling
LT DIETRICH
(curtly)
Kraus take three more of your men
and move forward with the point as
an advanced guard We will move
down the gully to the river It
should be about eight kilometers

Lt Krause nods and moves out
LT DIETRICH
One moment I have too much respect
for you as a soldier to believe you
will allow your personal feelings to
interfere with your duty to your

men

LT KRAUS
I hope I dont disappoint you

The lieutenants split and the patrol gets to its feet
anticipating the move

Kraus brings up three more men and the six-man advanced guard
trots out of the woods into the narrow stream bed

The patrol follows
DISSOLVE TO

LONG SHOT - THE VALLEY

e gully has deepened slightly and the trees and bushes are
slightly thicker

The hills on both sides have risen higher as the valley drops
towards the Main

Ahead on a slight spur leading out from the hill of the left
is a two story stone farmhouse

SHOT - LOW ANGLE - THE HOUSE FROM THE GULLY - 400 YARDS AWAY

The house is a dull grey but has sheds built against it of
white-painted wood It is partially destroyed by artillery
fire It seems completely deserted the windows are
shuttered and the doors closed No smoke comes from the
chimney The yard is muddy with the recent rains On the
spur it completely commands the valley

SHOT - THE GULLY

Kraus group moves cautiously along the gully They are
split three on each side Kraus in the lead The stream
bed is of white limestone rocks There are standing pools
of water Both banks are fringed with bushes and occasional
poplars and oaks The men are concentrating their attention
on the house up ahead It dominates the gully

LONG SHOT - ADVANCED PARTY AND HOUSE IN BG

The six men move forward at a crouch They seem to be
wanting to sit down and are barely restraining themselves

The tension is evident in the hunch of their shoulders and

the flex of their backs They are about 300 yards from the
house and 300 yards from the main group

SHOT - THE ADVANCED PARTY AND HOUSE IN BG

Suddenly the stillness of the house is broken by the barking
of a dog in one of the sheds He quits barking with a yelp
as if struck Suddenly two unseen MGs in the yard open fire
on the advanced party

SHOT - THE ADVANCED PARTY

Two men on the far side of the gully away from the house are
struck immediately and dropped

The other dives across to the bank sheltering the three on
that side

e gully is filled with the whine of ricochets off the rocks
of the stream bed

The rounds also slash the bushes on the bank and chew up the
dirt

The elevation of the American MGs gives them a good angle on
the gully and they pin the men tightly against the bank

SHOT - KRAUS AND THE THREE MEN

Kraus crouches against the bank pressing tightly to the
slight overhang as if his life depended on it

The three men glance at him and decide to do the same

The MGs criss-cross their fire and the ricochets and rock
chips whir

SHOT - DIETRICH AND THE MAIN BODY

Dietrich and the main body have squatted at the sound of the
firing up ahead

They are split into two columns on each side of the stream
bed They stretch back up the gully squatting and ready
looking like dark birds against the white limestone gravel
and boulders

Dietrich turns and waves up Bruggemann Stange appears at
his elbow

LT DIETRICH

(to Stange)
Get those three MG teams up here
quickly

Stange pivots without a word and runs off just as Bruggemann
arrives He couches beside Dietrich who has turned and is
looking towards the fighting

LT DIETRICH
(out loud to himself)
Where is that damn connecting file
He must have gotten pinned

LT BRUGGEMANN
Why doesnt Kraus open up

LT DIETRICH

(grimly)
We will see whether you can do it
better Take that number one MG and
move up to Kraus I want to hear
the heaviest volume of fire since
Stalingrad

(he looks around)
Im taking Stange and the other two
Well move up on the left When you
see a smoke grenade lift fire and
move on down the gully

SHOT - THE MACHINE GUN TEAMS

The MG teams dash up the gully Stange in the lead motions
them to squat down

SHOT - BRUGGEMANN AND FIRST TEAM

Bruggemann motions the first team to follow him In the lead
with his SMG at the ready he leads them around the bend in
the wash

They are moving forward at a crouch They hug the left bank
sometimes balancing themselves against it with their free
hand

Bruggemann leads with the gunner right behind He has a belt
hanging from the gun He is stout and has trouble keeping
up

Behind them are the assistant gunner and the two ammo
bearers Each has his weapon slung and two containers of
ammo in his hands

The volume of American MG fire grows louder as they
disappear

SHOT - HIGH ANGLE - FROM THE MAIN BODY TO THE HOUSE
e house has a layer of smoke hanging around it close to the

T

ground THE CAMERA LOOKS FROM THE TROOPS IN THE GULLY UP
ALONG A FENCE RUNNING ACROSS A ROAD AND TO THE LEFT OF THE
Hi

The house seems to loom above the gully dominating it The
fence running up to it attracts the eye as a logical
approach

SHOT - DIETRICH AND STANGE LOOKING AT THE HOUSE IN BG
SHOT - DIETRICH AND STANGE - ANOTHER ANGLE
LT DIETRICH

(still looking)
That damn thing sweeps the whole
valley and theres no defilade when
that road fords the wash

Sgt Stange nods Dietrich pulls a map from his tunic He
smooths it across his knee and studies it for several
moments

LT DIETRICH
There isnt any other approach to
the bridge

Stange frowns and nods dismally

LT DIETRICH
(gravely)
Well have to take that house

SHOT - BRUGGEMANN AND THE FIRST MG TEAM

On hands and knees Bruggemann leads the team forward They
are scrambling awkwardly along trying not to expose
themselves They look like crabs They stoop shuffle
crouch fall scramble stumble and waddle forward The bank
is too low to make for a graceful advance

The fire is loud and violent The whine of ricochets is a
steady buzz

SHOT - THE ADVANCED PARTY PINNED DOWN

The men are still pinned against the bank and have not
returned fire

Kraus seems to have almost nudged his way into a small
excavation in the bank He has his legs drawn up tightly

protecting his stomach against the ricochets

The Americans are alternating fire in a regular pattern of
bursts to save their barrels

Suddenly an MG from the main party opens with a long burst
searching the house

The Germans turn their heads and look back up the stream bed
hopefully

SHOT - UPSTREAM WITH ADVANCED PARTY PINNED IN FOREGROUND

Around the bend scramble the MG team led by Bruggemann They
scramble up to the advanced party

Bruggemann slams the gunner down where he wants the gun and
helps him hoist it up on the bank The assistant gunner
pants up and throws himself down by the gun banging the ammo
can on the rocks

LT BRUGGEMANN
(shouting)
Get it firing
(turning to the advanced
party)
Get up and fire your weapons
He pounds the closest man on the rear with his hand

Slipping his SMG from his shoulder he eases it across the
edge of the bank just as the MG begins to fire Bruggemanns
fire chops the bushes

He scramble along the bank pounding the men on the legs and
backs shoving them up to fire

LT BRUGGEMANN

(shouting)
Fire damn you fire Dont worry
about those damn Americans Fire

Fire
SHOTS - THE ADVANCED PARTY

The German fire is building up The men are firing short
bursts from their SMGs ducking down and popping back up to
fire off another

The MG assistant gunner is calmly shouting off range
adjustments as the gunner rips off short bursts and hunches
around to hit another area

Bruggemann has ducked down to reload He tears off his
magazine and slams another in its place Getting up he
squeezes off a short burst

He flops down beside Kraus
TWO SHOT - BRUGGEMANN AND KRAUS

Kraus doesnt even look up but sticks his shoulder deeper
into the embankment

Bruggemann sticks his face close and shouts above the din

LT BRUGGEMANN
(each word a curse)
Why the hell didnt you open fire

LT KRAUS
(trembling and
demoralized)
What does it matter Theyve got us
pinned down and blocked from the
river We have no other way

LT BRUGGEMANN

(slaps him across the

mouth)
Shut up damn you I would kill you
here if you werent the chosen
friend of Lt Dietrich

(he rises to crouch in

disgust)
Stay there and sweat

SHOT - THE GULLY THE MEN FIRING TOWARDS THE HOUSE IN BG

The fire crackles in rising and falling waves with the steady
burst of the MG providing a base
One of the advanced party gets hit and sinks forward No one
notices CAMERA MOVES CLOSER

SHOT - THE MACHINE GUN TEAM

The assistant gunner flicks the empty can away and gropes to
his rear for another one He looks around for it and is hit
instantly and killed

An ammo bearer reaches up as if to shake his hand and pulls
him into the wash He scrambles up beside the gun with a new
belt

The gunner loads it without noticing the new man

SHOT - ALONG THE AXIS OF THE MG - HOUSE IN BG

The gunner fires in bursts of five or six rounds

The house is about two hundred fifty yards away It shakes
and shudders as the gun vibrates The rounds whip a cloud of

dust into the yard

The American guns flash little spurts of yellow-white flame
and the smoke from their guns hangs in a layer in the yard

Spotting one MG in a shed the German gunner shifts his fire
The rounds spray the yard in front and splatter in the shed
The wood splinters and the gun chews at the door

The American gun answers with a series of flashes The
tracers from the guns seem to cross

SHOT - THE HOUSE IN BG FENCE AND BUSHES IN FG

SUDDENLY THE CAMERA CATCHES TWO FIGURES SLIDE OUT ACROSS THE
EDGE OF THE GULLY Dietrich is starting to move out his men

In the far right on the other side of the fence Stange is
directing the second gun

Another group of three men clear the edge and crouch-run in
the cover of the fence

An American MG fires and the rounds clip the bushes along the
fence and whine off the stones

One man is hit in the face and is blinded He stumbles and
is screaming for help as he gropes forward One of the three
stops back for him Grabbing him by the shirt he half lifts
half pulls him forward scrambling himself in a half-crouch

A volley of American rifle shots catch them There is a
desperate effort by the rescuer as the blinded German claws
forward They fall under a vortex of shots

SHOT - DIETRICH ALONG THE FENCE ON HIS STOMACH

Dietrich looks back The dead men look like crumpled mounds
of dirty clothes

SHOT - DIETRICH CROUCHING
He fires a long burst across the fence at the yard of the
farmhouse

LT DIETRICH
(shouting toward the
gully)
Get that damn MG up Get it up
The MG team clears the bank at a dead crouch-run

SHOT - ALONG THE FENCE FROM SUNKEN ROAD

In the foreground about four men are firing rifles at the
farmhouse

Along the fence the MG team pounds in a furious sprint
Dietrich is in their rear firing the SMG

SHOT - THE HOUSE IN BG THE FENCE WITH RUNNING MG TEAM IN
FG

THE CAMERA PANS A LONG SHOT

The MG team is desperately tearing for the shelter of the
road

The Americans open fire with the MG It cuts at the bushes
Dietrich is running now and stopping to fire short bursts

The MG team reaches the edge of the road They dive across
the road and hit the ditch Dietrich follows

SHOT - ALONG THE ROAD

The road is cut into the hill and is slightly below the
house It is cut on the side facing the house

The fence is gated across the road and runs on the other
side past the side and rear of the house and on into an
orchard

The Germans are huddled together still on the opposite side
of the fence from the house

Dietrich crawls along the ditch to the fence The men are
behind him The gunner cradling his weapon in one arm as he
crawls on the other

SHOT - THE DITCH

Dietrich tears off the wire below the regular fence line
blocking the ditch

He crawls through and the men follow him He points to the
position for the MG The team slams the gun into position

The men begin firing their rifles The gunner slams the bolt
closed and the gun erupts into fire

SHOT - THE HOUSE
The yard and the house are sheathed in smoke One gun had
been silenced Now all three German guns are spraying the
yard and chewing up the fence and sheds

The German riflemen are within one hundred fifty yards of the
house and have the windows and doors under constant fire

REVERSE - ACROSS THE ROAD TOWARDS THE GULLY

The gully is hung with smoke Occasionally small muzzle
flashes can be seen in the darkening smoke

Suddenly from the gully the MG team of Stange breaks clear
from the smoke and dashes across the field hugging the fence
line They disappear into the ditch

SHOT - THE DITCH

Stanges gun is going into action He drops beside Dietrich
in the ditch Dietrich is reloading

LT DIETRICH
Im moving out now Keep up the
fire until you see the smoke
grenade Make sure we leave the
rear of the house clear for them to
retreat Give me your grenades

Stange silently hands him four grenades from his tunic
pocket

SGT STANGE
(meaningly)
Good luck Sir
Dietrich moves down the ditch and hands a grenade to each of
his four men He pulls the two ammo bearers off each of the
guns as he moves down the line

The gunners are firing in regular alternating bursts

The assault unit is bunched around Dietrich There are eight
men and Dietrich

SHOT - LOW ANGLE - THE DITCH

Dietrich holds his SMG in his left hand a grenade lightly in
his right He vaults out of the ditch

Two men follow close behind him and clear

The next man is hit squarely in the chest with a burst of
carbine fire and is blasted back into the road

Three men clear Another burst of carbine fire gets one in
the leg He limps back and hops down calmly in the ditch

The final two men look a moment and clear

SHOT - THE FIELD IN FRONT OF THE FENCE

The men are lying like conspicuous blobs on the ground The
house looms ahead of them fifty yards up a slight grade It
is raked with MG fire

Dietrich is looking back at his final man moving up to flop
down They are spread in an irregular line about ten yards
apart

Dietrich motions ahead the right flank He fires over their
heads at the upper story of the house as they rush up the
grade about twenty yards and flop

The right flank begins to fire and Dietrich gets up and moves
forward The three men with him move up at a crouch One is
hit and rolls in a ball of pain on the ground

Dietrich doesnt even see him hit He and his men make a
dash for the wall of the house They fire at the lower
windows as they run They slam into the side of the house

SHOT - THE WALL OF THE HOUSE
Dietrich and his men press against the wall of the house

The windows on the ground floor are higher than the mens
heads Those on the second floor are considerably higher

CROSS SHOT - THE SLOPE AND THE WALL

The right flank makes its dash for the wall Several shots
ring out from the upper windows

One man is hit in the foot he hops madly for the wall

Sergeant Stanges MG chatters out in several short bursts
the rounds crash and splinter into the upper story

The second wave makes the wall panting heavily The wounded
man makes the last few yards leaping in long bounds on one
foot

He stumbles up the wall towards Dietrich using the wall for
support Dietrich grabs him under the arm as he pants to
regain his breath

WOUNDED SOLDIER
(gasping)

Lieutenant they are leaving the
house by the rear I saw first
three and then five more run out
into the orchard

LT DIETRICH
(leaning out to look up at
the upper windows)
Let them go
(he lowers the man to the
ground)
You sit here

LONG SHOT - THE ASSAULT UNIT ALONG THE WALL
The German MGs are still sporadically raking the front of

the house The American guns are silent Only rifle and
carbine fire are heard from the house broken by occasional
explosive burst of BAR fire
Dietrich and his men move along the wall towards the front

Dietrich pulls the pin on his grenade and tosses it underhand
around the corner of the house It splutters on the ground
for a moment and then begins to pour out a thick white
smoke

Dietrich holds out his arm to keep back his eager men With
his other he deftly pulls another grenade out of his tunic
pulls the pin with his teeth and tosses it after the first

It is also a smoke grenade Dietrich and his men pour around
the corner of the house into the envelope of smoke

SHOT - THE MEN IN THE YARD

The German guns are still But the front of the house is
battered with the results of their heavy fire

On the right lie the dead bodies of two Americans with their
LMG amidst discarded boxes of ammo The ground is littered
with cartridge cases

The smoke is heavy On the left of the house a splintered
shed burns ignited by tracers It adds to the smoke

The Germans fan out in the smoke and carefully sweep the
yard

SHOT - THE YARD - ANOTHER ANGLE

From the burning shed comes a high-pitched burst of carbine
fire It wildly sprays the area Then it stops abruptly

The Germans squat to the ground One man cuts loose a
barrage of shots from his rifle into the shed

SHOT - TOWARDS THE HOUSE - THE SHED FROM BOTH SIDES

The German fires and moves towards the shed at a crouch
From the rear of the shed hidden by the shed and the smoke
races an American corporal covering the withdrawal of his MG
team

They are cutting up an avenue of apple trees in the orchard
in the background The smoke is starting to drift into the
trees

The American corporal turns and fires another burst into the
shed Neither the American nor the Germans can see each
other

From the smoke comes a series of flashes from a German SMG

The American ducks and runs into concealment up a row of
trees

SHOT - THE SHED HOUSE AND ORCHARD

The shed runs along the wall of the house It looks at the
orchard across a broken fence that runs down the other side
of the spur into the wash

The Germans have cleared the yard and are checking along the
other side of the house and the shed

From the orchard where it runs higher up on the side of the
ridge and the spur comes a burst of American MG fire

The smoke is thin on this side of the house and has only
begun to drift up into the orchard

The shots are wild high up on the house The Germans
scatter Dietrich drops behind a well casing of stone He
fires a long burst up the slope into the orchard

LT DIETRICH
(bellowing)

Fall back into the gully Get
moving Fall bac

SHOT - ANOTHER ANGLE

The American gun fires another burst of well aimed fire It
catches one of the Germans racing back along the side of the
shed The velocity of the fire knocks him into the flimsy
wooden wall He crashes through and the rounds splinter the
wood and rack his body

Dietrich fires another burst and dashes back into the smoke

LT DIETRICH
(bellowing)
Sgt Stange get those MGs back
Displace to the gully

SGT STANGE (0S)
(from about fifty yards to
the right)
Take those guns and lets go Come
on

The scene is one of smoke and confusion There is another
burst of American MG fire raking the building A German
turns and lets loose a volley of rifle shots fired from the
hip up into the orchard He cannot see the gun but fires
into the trees

The rounds crash and cut into the branches There is another
answering burst of American fire Then stillness

LONG SHOT - THE VALLEY

The house has a shattered look The shed beside it burns
There are bodies of Germans and Americans crumpled here and
there In the yard there is a bright brassy litter of
cartridge cases

Smoke hangs in a layer thickly around the house A slight
breeze drifts the smoke up the slope into the orchard It
clings like a white syrup to the ground and drifts slowly up
the avenues of trees

SHOT - GERMANS IN THE GULLY

Dietrichs remaining men and Stanges MG teams are the worse
for wear About half the original group remain and of these
half again are wounded One man wounded in the leg has been
carried bodily down Another limps painfully from a wound in
the foot

LT DIETRICH

(to Stange)
We will have to clear that ford
before they get organized and that
smoke blows off

(he looks around)
I want you to use the four assault
men and form a rear guard

SGT STANGE
(unlimbers his SMG)
Ill make it hot for them if they
follow us in the gully

LT DIETRICH

(checks the chamber)
We must have fifteen minutes for
reorganization

SGT STANGE
(checks his chamber)
Ill guarantee you that Lieutenant

A volley of shots rings out from the orchard and they all
duck

SGT STANGE
Theyre firing from up in that damn
orchard

LT DIETRICH

(getting up)
They havent spotted us yet They
are still covering the house Lets
get moving Allow us a hundred yard
start

(loudly)
MG teams move out The riflemen
are with Sgt Stange

SHOT - THE GULLY - THE GERMANS BEGIN TO MOVE
The MG teams need no urging They trot off down the gully

One team is reduced to a gunner and an assistant They have
only three boxes of ammo left

The other team has three men but only the belt in the gun
The assistant gunner trots up beside the first team and gets
a box of ammo

Behind them the rifle men spread out at Stanges signal
Stange pulls the wounded man off into shelter by the bank of
the gully He takes his rifle and all ammo

The MG teams with Dietrich have disappeared at a trot down
the gully and around the bend Stange waves back his rear
guard They start after the MG teams at a slower pace

HIGH ANGLE LONG SHOT - THE ENTIRE SCENE

Far off to the left the house is still shrouded in smoke
But the smoke has spread and thinned It hangs over the
house yard and orchard like a haze

The rear guard of Stanges has disappeared around the bend
They reappear again in the next stretch and then are gone
again

In the orchard there is movement The Americans have
reorganized Half a squad are flanking down the orchard
approaching the house cautiously

They are shadowy and obscure in the haze They move past the
well and along the sheds One man idly turns over the body
of a German

More men follow them out of the haze from the orchard One
is an officer He gestures this group around the rear of the
house

The men come towards the camera As Dietrich nears the
camera he steps out of line and urges the troops to close it
up as they move by

SHOT - THE COLUMN OF TROOPS PASSES

The faces of the men show that they are near the breaking
point They are haggard grimy with dirt and powder burns
streaked with sweat some wounded from rock chips in the
previous fire fight They stumble clumsily along on the
slippery rocks

SHOT - A WOUNDED MAN

A young soldier badly wounded in the shoulder stumbles
along gasping with pain Tears are streaming down his face

He is dashing back in a crouch when an Ml magazine is emptied
in rapid sequence He half turns to return fire when he is
hit by another burst of fire which drops him in his tracks
His body lies half submerged in the stream

SHOTS - THE MAIN PART OF GERMANS

Dispersed behind cover along both sides of the slopes of the
gully They holds their fire waiting for the Americans

SHOT - DIETRICH
He snaps the bolt of his SMG
LONG SHOT - THE GULLY

The two Germans fire again and pull back through the bushes
They are hidden but the rustling of the bushes gives away
their position FROM A POSITION TO THE REAR AND TO ONE SIDE
OF ONE OF THE MGS IN AMBUSH THE CAMERA WATCHES THE ACTION AS
IF IT WERE ONE OF THE PATROL

SHOTS - THE AMERICAN ADVANCE GUARD

From around the curve skirting the bushes on the sunny side
of the stream edge two American riflemen

Then on the shady side comes the man with the carbine
One of the riflemen an NCO waves forward the rifleman

He runs up the sunny side and takes cover in a position
dominating the next bend of the stream

The NCO then waves forward the carbine man
LONG SHOTS - ANOTHER ANGLE FROM THE AMBUSH

The carbine man runs up the shady side one boot crunching
the gravel the other splashing in the stream He dives
behind a fallen tree where he can see down the next stretch
of the stream

LONG SHOT - ANOTHER ANGLE FROM THE AMBUSH

The NCO looks behind him and waves up the rest of the
American patrol THE CAMERA WATCHES THE ACTION BELOW
FRAMING THE SHOT ARE TREES AND BRUGGEMANN KNEELING WITH HIS
SMG IN A SHADOW

LONG SHOT - ANOTHER ANGLE FROM THE AMBUSH

The NCO looks ahead and waves the rifleman forward moving up
as he does so The rifleman trots forward as the carbine man
covers As the NCO comes up he waves the carbine man forward
and as he trots up the shady side the NCO drops to cover
both his point men

LONG SHOT - ANOTHER ANGLE FROM THE AMBUSH

The NCO pauses for a minute and then moves around the bend
after his men THE CAMERA WATCHES THE ACTION BELOW IN THE
FOREGROUND KRAUS IS WATCHING WITH AN EYESTRAINING INTENSITY
His hands grip his SMG until the knuckles whiten

LONG SHOT - ANOTHER ANGLE FROM THE AMBUSH

Suddenly around the upper bend the first elements of the
well dispersed American patrol move cautiously They are one
of three squads of the platoon attacked in the farmhouse
They peer everywhere their weapons at the ready as they walk
slowly along in two columns one on each side of the stream
A lieutenant heads up the column on the sunny side

LONG SHOT - SLOW PAN
THE CAMERA MOVES ALONG BEHIND THE MEN IN AMBUSH CATCHING
SIGHT OF THE AMERICAN PATROL THROUGH THE TREES The Germans
silently pull pins on their grenades and hold them ready in
their fists

Still the patrol moves on until the three squads are
contained in the bend of the river The lead man idly kicks
over the body of Sgt Stange as he passes

THE PANNING CAMERA REACHES DIETRICH IN THE LINE OF GERMANS IN
AMBUSH Dietrich drops his hand and the German MG begins to
fire

QUICK CUTS - GERMANS IN AMBUSH

The Germans unleash a shower of grenades that arch down on
the Americans as the MGs start to sweep the line

LONG SHOTS - THE GULLY AND SHADY RIDGE

The shady woods erupt with fire just as the grenades explode
The American patrol is caught entirely by surprise As the
grenades explode everything is chaos and smoke with the
German MGs cutting through the confusion with a hail of fire
that stitches back and forth across the water

QUICK CUTS
The American lieutenant tries to rally his men to fire but is

cut down by a burst of SMG fire The shady side containing
the ambush is sheathed in smoke

LONG SHOT - THE GULLY AND SHADY RIDGE

Every American has been killed or wounded The German
riflemen have stopped firing seeing no targets The MGs
continue for several seconds and then halt There is a
terrible stillness

SHOTS - THE GULLY AND SHADY RIDGE

The stillness and the smoke seem to hang in the air together
Slowly the slight wind coming down the gully begins to carry
off the smoke As it rises the lumps of bodies can be seen
in the stream or half in the bushes at the edge The water
is muddy from the blood and the silt kicked up as the men
raced futilely for safety The gurgling stream washes in and
around the bodies

SHOT - THE GERMANS SLOWLY COME DOWN THE HILLSIDE

The Germans come down from ambush with their weapons ready
The American wounded are beginning to cry for medics The
Germans are ready for a trap or for someone to shoot at them
as they come out Their body attitude and readiness of their
SMGs denotes caution

SHOT - THE GERMANS MOVE OUT IN THE STREAM
When the Germans get out in the stream they see that all

fight has left the Americans Immediately they begin pulling
the wounded out of the water They sling their weapons over
their shoulders and work in pairs gently carrying the
Americans up onto the edge of the stream where the medic can
treat them

SHOT - DIETRICH

Dietrich ignores all this activity He rushes down the hill
and splashes through the stream to Stange The sergeant is
lying on his back in the stream his head under water in a
pool where the American soldier has turned him over

Dietrich drops to his knees and pulls up the head of the
sergeant The water runs down his face and from his hair
Dietrich looks at him sadly thinking sentimentally of all
their missions together He idly buttons a pocket on the
sergeants tunic

SHOT - DIETRICH

Dietrich reaches down and struggles up with the dripping body
of the sergeant in his arms He staggers over to the sunny
side of the stream with his burden and places it down by the
wounded Americans Reaching down he runs his hands quickly
over the face closing the eyes He wipes the water from his
hands on his pants Bruggemann comes up and points

THREE SHOT - DIETRICH KRAUS AND WOUNDED LIEUTENANT

Dietrich nods Kraus back a bit Kraus moves away a few feet
Dietrich kneels As he kneels his friendly interrogator
smile appears

LT DIETRICH
(the professional charm)
Is there anything I can do to make
you more comfortable Lieutenant --
(looks at dog tag)
Foote

LT FOOTE
(sarcastic)
Well a perfect gentleman
Dietrich pauses a moment studying the American Then he
smiles pleasantly

LT DIETRICH
I can understand your bitterness at
being wounded Lieutenant Foote

LT FOOTE
(wincing in pain)
Say thats mighty decent of you

LT DIETRICH
If I may I would suggest you do not
waste your strength in anger

LT FOOTE
(coughs in pain)
Why dont you go to hell

LT DIETRICH
(after a sympathetic
shrug)
It might be an improvement Would
you like a cigarette

LT FOOTE
Okay

While he talks Dietrich lights one and puts in it the
Americans mouth

LT DIETRICH
Are you in great pain

LT FOOTE
(bitterly)
Only when I laugh

LT DIETRICH
(an obvious con)
Very witty I hope I can make jokes

LT DIETRICH
Look your wound may be serious
You probably havent much time Why

LT FOOTE

(smothers a painful laugh)
Okay heres come decent advice
Find the nearest American soldier
and surrender Every rear echelon
unit has been alerted to your
presence I dont know what you
fellows think youre trying to do
but in case you havent heard

(coughs)
The war is lost And in case you
dont know which side lost it --

unconsciousness)

Dietrich stands and frowns
TWO SHOT - DIETRICH AND KRAUS
They stand a little apart from the others and talk quietly

LT KRAUS
Hes right Paul

This is the end Paul Its not
suicide to go on Its murder

the war The only thing that
matters now is rebuilding what is
left so that our children may have a
chance for peace and happiness that
we never had The bridge doesnt
matter It never did

patrol and making the wounded comfortable When Kraus

finishes
if to ask

Dietrich waits several seconds before replying
Are you quite through

LT DIETRICH
Oskar my friendship has permitted
you to indulge in this orgy of self-
pity and self-righteousness My
patience is at an end You will
either conduct yourself properly
from this moment on or you will
have to face the consequences

For a moment Kraus blinks in surprise at his friend

LT KRAUS
(derisively)
Would you have me shot Paul

LT DIETRICH
I threatened nothing specific

Dietrich stands with arms crossed looking unfortunately

much like

a recruiting poster

LT KRAUS

attention riveted on the scene between the two

Marvelous
(making fun of Dietrichs
stance)
Just tilt the chin a little to the
right ah a masterpiece

LT DIETRICH
(getting angry)
Form up your section Your behavior
is jeopardizing the security of the
mission

LT KRAUS
The security of the mission You
dont give a damn about getting
everyone killed The only thing you
care about is that the great the
noble the heroic Lieutenant
Dietrich always completes his
mission Its not courage Its
just that youre more afraid of
failing than you are of getting
killed

trembling with anger takes out his pistol
side No one stirs

LT DIETRICH
Lieutenant Oskar Kraus by the
authority vested in me by the Third
Reich I order you to form up your
section at once

LT KRAUS
(mockingly)
But the pistol Paul What is the
pistol for

LT DIETRICH
Dont drive me too far

LT KRAUS
You mean you wouldnt want to shoot
me

suddenly personal again)
Oskar I beg of you Come to your
senses

LT KRAUS
And I beg of you -- come to your
senses

Dietrich fumes silently then gathers his full resolve

LT DIETRICH
For the last time are you going to
obey my order

LT KRAUS
(certain that he wont)
I am afraid you will have to shoot
me

CLOSE - DIETRICH

Trembling with emotion he notices the blank stares of his
men Thinks for a moment how foolish he must appear to them
Tries to work up enough anger at his friend to pull the
trigger but cant

LT DIETRICH
Very well if you wish to surrender
you may stay here with the wounded

CLOSE - KRAUS

LT KRAUS
No If you leave me here I will
tell everything I know about the
mission It cannot be long until
more Americans arrive

LT DIETRICH
(exploding)
What in heavens name do you want

LT KRAUS
You must either shoot me or give up
the mission

LT DIETRICH
Oskar I warn you not to overplay
your hand

LT KRAUS
You think Im bluffing

LT DIETRICH
This has gone on long enough Sit
down over there and be quiet

LT KRAUS
Im not bluffing I swear to tell
everything if you leave me here

LT DIETRICH
Youre leaving me absolutely no
choice

LT KRAUS
Fine Lets see then whether you
have the courage to shoot me
yourself

LT DIETRICH
(to Bruggemann)

Form up the patrol and move out

LT BRUGGEMANN
(not wanting to miss
anything)
Yes sir

SHOT - THE PATROL
Begins to form up into a widely spread column

LT KRAUS
If you cant do it yourself just
order it done

SHOT - BRUGGEMANN
Turns back with a look of hate and disgust at Kraus
SHOT - DIETRICH

He notices the cynical exchange of glances among the men and
realizes what an utter fool he must appear to be He walks
to Kraus in a very business-like manner Kraus reads his
face like the small letters in an eye chart

LT KRAUS
Bruggemann will do it wont you
Bruggemann

Without any warning Dietrich knocks him down with a sweeping
punch to the jaw He pins Kraus with his knees and smashes
him in the face several times with his open hand

CLOSE DIETRICH - BENDING CLOSE

LT DIETRICH
(softly)
Im sorry Oskar You know I wont
harm you Please I beg of you
come to your senses

CLOSE KRAUS - SQUINTING IN PAIN

His lips twitching from the blows he manages a smile He is
visibly touched by his friends apparently brutal but
nevertheless convincing demonstration of affection Dietrich
had every right to have him shot Kraus had tastefully
overplayed the belief that Dietrich would not shoot him Now
he smiles at Dietrich with wet eyes and a lump in his throat

LT KRAUS
You were perfectly right It is I
who should apologize
CLOSE DIETRICH - EQUALLY CHOKED WITH EMOTION
He helps him to his feet
CLOSE KRAUS - BRUSHING BACK HIS HAIR
LT KRAUS
Dont worry about me anymore I

still think youre crazy but I wont
cause you anymore trouble

SHOT - THE PATROL - DUSK

The sun shafts at a deep angle through the trees casting
dark shadows

The patrol is traversing the sloping sides of the gully It
has deepened considerably as it nears the main gorge

Below the shadows blend into darkness

The sides of the gully are loose shale and the men find it
tricky footing Some stumble and slide down several yards
until they stop against a tree and can clamber back up again
The pace and their weariness are affecting their quickness

SHOT - DIETRICH
The pace is beginning to affect him also His step has lost

most of that aggressive bounce but he continues to grind out
the distance step by step

He looks alertly around glancing up slope

SHOT - UP SLOPE - THE FLANK GUARDS

About fifty feet up slope are two flank guards moving
parallel and slightly ahead of the patrol column They are
just below the top of the ridge

REVERSE - PAST THE FLANK GUARDS DOWN SLOPE TO PATROL

Kraus is pulling one of the wounded men along by letting the
man hold onto his belt They stumble forward together

SHOT - THE REAR OF THE PATROL

One of the demo men falls He rolls over and sits up but is
too tired to move

Bruggemann comes up Without a word he hauls the man roughly
to his feet and shoves him forward

The man begins again to stumble forward The whole scene is
a nightmare of exhaustion

DISSOLVE TO
LONG SHOT - MAIN GORGE AND RIVER BY BRIGHT MOONLIGHT - NIGHT
The main gorge is wide and deep The river is swift and
narrow at this point it is very shallow racing over stones
and boulders and is about thirty yards across
The gorge widens beyond the river about fifteen yards on each
side The cliffs broken here and there by faults and

gullies rise steeply two hundred feet on both sides

Between the base of the cliffs and the river edge on both
sides is a thick growth of small trees and underbrush
Spring floods have deposited debris in the brush

In some areas this band of brush overhangs the river edge
But in other stretches there is a narrow border of white

gravel

The sky holds all the yellow light The cliffs and river
absorb all the shadows The bushes are black

SHOT - THE PATROL DESCENDING INTO GORGE - MOONLIGHT

The patrol cuts in a steep traverse down the shale slope of
the gully

In the background is the man gorge There is a thick tangle
of brush and a white gravel bar where the gully joins the

gorge

The patrol disappears into the gathering blend of shadows and
bushes as they head down into the gorge and into the thicket

CLOSE DIETRICH
He stops and smiles excitedly
SLOW UPWARD PAN FROM RIVER BED - THE BRIDGE

The river is in darkness the sky framed by the darkness of
the cliffs seems lighter

In the distance suddenly cutting across the sky is the arch
of the bridge flaring out from one dark cliff and leaping

across to the other

It is a steel girder single span bridge The flat road bed
rests on the single girdered arch beneath

The interlace of girders cross beams spanners and braces
makes an intricacy that interacts dramatically with the
single powerful bulk of the arch

SHOT - THE BRIDGE RIVER AND GORGE

There is a steady stream of trucks across the bridge They
are visible only be the occasional flash of their lights

But their traffic noise echoes in the gorge competing with
the rush of the river

Once and a while a tank column makes a rumble on the bridge
like distant thunder

SHOT - HIGH ANGLE - UP THE GORGE

Far up the river the tiny figures of an American patrol
round a bend in the river

Platoon-sized the men are spread out and moving deliberately
forward a column on each side of the river

SHOT - THE GERMANS

e point and Dietrich spot a splashing American at the same
time He is about fifty yards in front of them

Dietrich makes a desperate signal for the Germans to get
down They ease down quickly in their tracks It is as if
the patrol has disappeared The camouflaged faces the dirty
uniforms the combat experience blend them into shadows of
the bushes and the ground

The only sounds are the splashes and gurgles from the river
as it races over the rocks

SHOT - THE AMERICAN PATROL

They round another bend and start along the section of river
approaching the thick growth and gravel bar at the mouth of
the gully

The lieutenant in charge steps out of line and looks back at
his men He makes some signal to his sergeant in the rear

The water mainly dark catches occasional flashes of light
from the sky as the current roils the surface

The Americans make a pattern of movements in the shadows
overhanging the banks

In the center of the stream one American makes a ripple of
light in the dark water as he splashes across to the other
side and is then gone again in the shadows

SHOT - THE FACES OF THE GERMANS
The German faces reflect the tension The situation is

dangerous They are out-numbered two-to-one and pinned
against the wall of the cliff

They are too close to the bridge to fight and then carry out
the demolition

They feel as if the Americans can hear their breathing
SHOT - THE AMERICAN PATROL - FROM THE RIVER BED

Beneath the Germans and about fifty yards away the American
patrol methodically picks its way past upstream

The main body passes the next bend

The rear guard splashes along behind and then follows around
the curve

The river is empty and the emptiness is filled by the sounds
of the current

THE CAMERA HOLDS ON THE EMPTY RIVER FOR SEVERAL BEATS

Then the Germans slowly move out of the bushes and into the
river

The noise of the river drowns out their noise and it is as if
they were moving in perfect silence

They hug the shadows on the edge of the river They move
downstream towards the bridge The blackness of their faces
their bulging loads of demolition and the tension in their
movements contrast ominously with the attitude of the
American patrol

UP

POV - LOOKING UP AT THE ARCH OF THE BRIDGE HIGH ABOVE FROM
ALMOST UNDERNEATH

The interlace of girders cross beams spanners and braces
loom black against the moonlit sky The traffic noises echo
weirdly against the cliff walls

FULLER SHOT - DIETRICH BRUGGEMANN AND KRAUS

Behind them the remainder of the patrol about 20 men are
deployed behind cover

LT DIETRICH
I think this side is the easier one
A four cut should drop that end
neatly in the gorge

Bruggemann nods in agreement

LT DIETRICH
How many climbers are left

LT BRUGGEMANN
Mandel is the only one still with us
but his hand is badly smashed

LT DIETRICH
Well it looks like you and I will

have to manage alone eh Peter

LT BRUGGEMANN
We can do it

LT DIETRICH

(pointing)
Good Get the rope and explosives
collected

LT BRUGGEMANN
At once
(he exits)

Dietrich turns to Kraus The two friends clasp hands

LT DIETRICH
Set up the perimeter Keep an eye
out for that patrol If they come
back while were still up in the
bridge open fire on them Give us
as much time as possible

LT KRAUS
Dont worry about that
(grabbing him by the arm)
Be careful will you

LT DIETRICH
(clasps back of Kraus’
neck)
You too

SHOT - FOLLOWING DIETRICH

He slips away from Kraus and moves toward the base of the
cliff where Bruggemann has collected their gear

SHOT - KRAUS

He silently gestures the men into a defensive perimeter
moving flank outposts up the downstream

SHOT - DIETRICH AND BRUGGEMANN

Falling rubble from the cliff has cut away the brush from the
base of the fault

Dietrich and Bruggemann prepare for the climb

To one side two demo men lay out the explosives and the
auxiliary equipment like doctors laying out surgical tools

In the background several men of the security detail move
into position

Dietrich and Bruggemann lay down their SMGs They have only
knifes and pistols They toss their helmets down Each has
a coil of rope slung from his shoulder

Bruggemann slaps Dietrich on the shoulder to indicate he is
ready Dietrich stamps his boots and adjusts his belt He
is ready

The demo men pay no attention They are checking the
satchels

SHOTS - DIETRICH AND BRUGGEMANN
The cliff has a fault that runs at an angle from the right
down under the arch Rubble and debris have washed down it

and clog the fault at the bottom

Dietrich and Bruggemann start up They slip a little in the
loose shale

SHOTS - UP THE FAULT

Dietrich leads The fault has narrowed into a chimney
Bracing his back against one wall of the chimney and his feet
against the other he edges himself up by pushing with his
hands

Bruggemann follows

SHOT - DIETRICH
The tension and effort show on his face
SHOTS - THE MEN IN THE CHIMNEY BELOW THE BRIDGE

They seem to be inching themselves along The chimney
carries them out from under the bridge to the right of the
abutment

The fault slopes less and less sharply and finally runs off
into a narrow ledge

DISSOLVE TO
CROSS SHOT - CLIMBERS ON THE LEDGE

They are now on a level slightly above the level of the
abutment The camera looks along the ledge and across
towards the frame of the bridge The climbers are in the
foreground

The bridge looks near and enormous
SHOTS - THE ARCH OF THE BRIDGE

From this close the mass of the bridge fragments into
intricate and delicate balances of steel members and
tensions

The traffic noise has dissolved into the individual noises of
each vehicle as it rumbles and roars across the bridge

SHOTS - THE CLIMBERS

Dietrich and Bruggemann rope themselves together on the
ledge

They are very deliberate about their task checking each knot
twice Dietrich ties a double bowline and shrugs into it
like a tight vest after pulling on it hard to set the knots

He adjusts it around his chest The rope runs from the
center of his back over to Bruggemann

Bruggemann knots a bowline around his waist with the other
free end The men are now tied in at opposite ends of the
rope

The line running between them Bruggemann coils carefully
He places the coil behind him letting the section of the
rope running from the coil to Dietrich pass across his body
in a running belay or brake

Dietrich watches this accomplished He then makes a sign to
Bruggemann and starts feeling his way along the ledge towards
the bridge

He strips off rope from the coil Bruggemann lets the rope
run from the coil to his right hand then across his back to
his left hand and on to Dietrich Should Dietrich fall he
will snap his right hand into his chest using his body as a
snubbing post to stop the fall
He is on one knee braced with his right leg stiff in front of
him along the narrow ledge

SHOT - DIETRICH

Dietrich continues to edge along feeling for hand and foot
holds on the face of the cliff

The distance to the bridge abutment looks about twenty feet

He edges forward He is flat against the cliff in a spread-
eagled position His fingers are dug into a small crevice

He edges out with his left foot on a narrow crack until there
is room for his right Shifting his weight as much as
possible he pushes his body into a balanced position by a
desperate effort of his arms He is about eight feet or so
from the abutment

Reaching above him as high as he can he finds a strong hand
hold Lifting himself by this he steps up onto another
small foot hold

This can only accommodate his left foot

The abutment is below him and about eight or nine feet away

He is flattened against the cliff but manages to carefully
turn his head back towards the belay man

SHOT - ACROSS DIETRICH TO BRUGGEMANN

Dietrich hisses for more rope

Bruggemann slowly pays out five six then seven feet He
shakes his head The slack would give Dietrichs falling

body the momentum to jerk them off the ridge

Dietrich hisses violently and Bruggemann eases off another
yard

SHOT - DIETRICH

Turning his head back carefully Dietrich looks across at the
abutment judging the distance He is breathing heavily

SHOTS FROM ABOVE - DIETRICH

THE CAMERA LOOKS DOWN ON DIETRICH AND ON INTO THE GORGE

The sensation is one of dizzying height The blackness of
the cliffs make the gorge look like a giant maw The torrent
crashes through the cut beneath the bridge

Suddenly Dietrich leaps

SHOT FROM ABOVE - DIETRICH

He hits the edge of the abutment waist high and clings to it
with all his strength

Below the darkness and the roar of the river blend into a
frightening background
THE CAMERA CATCHES THE DESPERATION ON HIS FACE

He gets a knee over and inches himself onto the abutment He
finally stands up

SHOT - DIETRICH ON THE ABUTMENT
Dietrich unties the rope from his body with difficulty

He tosses the rope over the arched girder tied into the
abutment

He grabs the dangling free end and pulls it down
SHOT - DOWN PAST BRUGGEMANN

The slack is pulled across The rope is taut to the bowline
around Bruggemanns waist

He edges forward as far as possible on the ledge and Dietrich
takes up this slack

Dietrich wraps the free end hanging down the cliff in a belay
running under his arm across his back around his waist and
down the cliff He signals Bruggemann that he is ready

SHOT FROM ABOVE - BRUGGEMANN AND DIETRICH

THE CAMERA LOOKS DOWN AGAIN INTO THE DIZZYING ABYSS OF THE
GORGE

Bruggemann hesitates for several moments and then jumps off
pushing out with his hand from the cliff

He drops for a moment until he takes up the slack Then he
stops with a jolt that lifts Dietrich off his feet for a
split second as the rope slams taut

Bruggemann swings around to the face of the abutment He
turns there helplessly until he finally gets a foot on the
face of the abutment His weight is balanced across the
girder with Dietrichs

In position now he grabs the free end of the rope and hauls
himself up as Dietrich also pulls on the free end to help the
lift

SHOT - THE ABUTMENT

Dietrich reaches down and pulls Bruggemann up Bruggemann
sits and rests for a moment The rumbling of traffic
overhead is quite loud

He unties the rope Dietrich helps him with the knots
jammed tight by the drop

They free the rope and let it fall free down the cliff after
tying one end around the girder Dietrich shakes the rope
three times

SHOT - DEMOLITIONS TEAM BELOW BRIDGE TIES EXPLOSIVE PACKS TO
ROPE
In only a few seconds the rope slaps three times against the
abutment The demolitions are tied on

SHOT - DIETRICH and BRUGGEMANN ON THE ABUTMENT

Dietrich stands carefully out of the way as Bruggemann
straining hauls up the load hand-over-hand When it
reaches the abutment Dietrich pulls it up onto the shelf
They untie the load and drop the rope back down

Dietrich reaches up and slaps one satchel into the angle the
arching beam makes with the abutment wall

LT DIETRICH
(whispering)
Place the two upper charges Ill
wire the opposite lower one and then
tie in the two upper ones on the way
back here

Bruggemann nods They place the straps of the satchels over
their heads Dietrich has one satchel anda reel of wire
Bruggemann has two satchels

SHOT - DIETRICH

Dietrich lifts himself up onto a sitting position on the
arching beam Getting to his feet he starts up the arch in
an apelike climb bent at the waist and balancing with his
hands on the girder

SHOT - DIETRICH FROM ABOVE

He reaches the first main cross section He lifts up and
grabs the upright brace

Below the river races in a giddy torrent one hundred feet
below

SHOT - TO THE FAR ARCHES BEAM - BELOW RIVER YAWS SICKENINGLY

There is a cross brace connecting to the far arched beam It
is about two feet wide

Dietrich starts out on it on hands and knees crawling with
great care He deliberately puts one hand in front then
advances the opposite knee Then he pushes the other hand
forward

SHOT - DIETRICH ON THE CROSS BEAM FROM FAR ARCH

He slowly approaches the far arch He slowly rises up
grabbing the upright brace

He pauses for a moment Then he seats himself carefully on
the arched beam and edges down it toward its abutment He
eases his way by planting his rubber-soled shoes flat against
the metal of the beam and braking himself down

SHOT - DIETRICH FROM BELOW

He reaches the extreme angle where the arched beam abuts
against the concrete wall He eases the satchel off one
shoulder and places it in his lap

CLOSE SHOTS - DIETRICH

Taking out his cap crimpers and using the pointed end he
jams a hole through the top of the canvas satchel and deep
into the yielding explosive

Leaving the crimpers in the hole he takes out the cap box
flips open the top and gently removes a cap He puts it in
his mouth and returns the box to his pocket

He strips off a half a dozen turns of wire from the reel and
lets the loose end rest in his lap on the satchel

Looking around he finds an extruding bolt and knots the wire
around it leaving several feet of free end

Taking the cap from his mouth he enters the bared end of the
wire in the open end of the aluminum cylinder of the cap
Holding this arrangement between thumb and forefinger he
grabs the cap crimpers and crimps the edges of the cylinder
hard against the wire

He shoves the cap with the wire running from it into the
hole in the satchel charge pressing the yielding plastic
explosive down around it to hold it in

SHOT - DIETRICH - DIZZYING DOWN ANGLE

Leaning over he lowers the satchel into the angle of the
beam and abutment Reaching down with his foot he
delicately pushes it tightly into the crevice

He runs his hand back from the satchel along the wire to the
anchor knot around the bolt and then to the reel

Turning around carefully he slips the reel back over his
neck and shoulder He monkey walks back towards the first
cross section with the wire stripping from the reel behind
him He slips and almost falls

SHOT - DIETRICH IN GIRDERS OF UPPER BRIDGE

Dietrich swings around the upright brace and gets a foot in
the angle of the diagonal He begins to climb up The
punched holes in the diagonal brace make good footholds

He reaches the joint in the center with the crossing diagonal
brace He carefully swings around and up onto diagonal going
back the opposite way He climbs up into the gloom

SHOT - DIETRICH REACHES THE MAIN UPPER BEAM

Dietrich swings the reel around in front of him The wire
stretches back to the first charge He lifts off several
turns and makes a loop threading it through a rivet hole
and then knots it back on itself to form an anchor knot He
slings the reel back over his shoulder out of the way

Out of his pocket he takes the cap box and extracts another
cap placing it in his mouth and returning the box to his
pocket

From his other pocket he removes a connector wire bare on
one end and with an alligator clip on the other

He inserts the stripped end of the wire in the open end of
the cap Taking out his crimpers he crimps it firmly but
gently

Reaching up above him he drives the pointed end of the
crimpers deep into the explosive piercing the canvas cover
of the satchel He inserts the cap and kneads the explosive
down around it firmly He returns the crimpers to his
pocket

Running his fingers along the connector he picks up the
clip He bites the clip into the main wire before it reaches
the anchor knot Pressing it in hard with his fingers to
make certain of the connection

SHOT - DIETRICH FROM BELOW

Without turning around he starts back down the diagonal
member The wire strips off the reel after him

SHOT - DIETRICH and BRUGGEMANN ON THE ABUTMENT

Bruggemann stands below on the shelf of the abutment
Dietrich lowers himself onto the shelf

LT DIETRICH
(whispered)

Give me the timer

Bruggemann reaches in his tunic and carefully hands Dietrich
the timing detonator

SHOT - DIETRICH

Dietrich gently places the timer inside his tunic

SHOT - SHARP DOWN ANGLE

Dietrich gestures Bruggemann to go down

Bruggemann wraps the rope around his body in a rappel belay
The rope runs from the fixed end between his legs across the
buttocks around the waist across the shoulder and down
along the back Holding the free end in his right hand for a
brake he binds it by clenching his fist on the rope and
slamming his fist across his chest

Dietrich watches as he edges over the abutment letting the
rope slip slowly until he is over the side feet against the
abutment wall

SHOT FROM ABOVE - BRUGGEMANN

Bouncing slightly he releases the rope and slides in short

checked hops down the cliff face into the darkness of the
gorge
He disappears into the gloom Suddenly the rope is slack
It shakes three times

SHOT - DIETRICH

Dietrich sits on the reel of wire He takes out the timing
detonator

With his crimpers he cuts the wire close to the reel leaving
plenty of slack He strips the end of the wire with
deliberation

Taking the stripped end he fastens it into the spring loaded
terminals by pushing them in hooking the wire in the notch
and releasing them The springs slam the terminals tightly
against the wires

INSERT - WATCH

Dietrich looks at his watch for a moment and then back at the
timer

CLOSE UP - THE TIMER

There is a key in the back Dietrich winds the key tight
The dial shows setting up to five hours Dietrich pushes in
the pointer knob and turns it to one hour When it is on the
hour he releases it

The timers makes a loud click and the pointer moves slightly
The timer is loaded It is spring-driven magneto triggered
by the timer When the pointer is released and meddling with
t

c

e mechanism will activate the magneto exploding the
arges

Dietrich gingerly sets the timer around behind the girder out
of the way It makes a second click as he gently sets it
down

SHOT - DIETRICH

Dietrich unties the rope from the girder and reties it ina
slip knot

He takes the free end of the wire from the reel and ties it
firmly to the slip knot

He wraps the free end of the rope around him in a rappel
belay

He edges onto the edge leaning back against the rope He
moves to the left to check the timer It lets out another
satisfying click

He edges back to the left and swings the reel of wire up over
his shoulder with his left hand all the while keeping
tension on the rope and his right hand binding the free end
into his chest

He eases off on the brake hand and slips over the edge
SHOT - FROM ABOVE - DIETRICH

In short leaps he disappears down into the gorge and the
darkness The wire unwinds from the reel as he goes

SHOT - THE DETONATOR
The timer is clicking intermittently

The rope is taut and then suddenly slack Dietrich has
reaches the bottom

The timer clicks again

Then the wire tightens It begins to pull the loop of the
slip know down the rope into the gorge releasing it

SHOT - DIETRICH - UNDER BRIDGE

Dietrich pulls in the wire and grabs the knot The rope
falls free in a tangle of coils at his feet He unties the
wire

He quickly coils the rope around his arm in rhythmic turns
He slings it over his shoulder Picking up the reel he
hangs the strap over his neck and deliberately winds up the
loose wire

He glances around the area in a final check Kicking at a
track in the shale he is finally satisfied He and
Bruggemann look once more up the cliff at the bridge with
satisfaction

SHOT - UP THE CLIFF TO THE BRIDGE

The bridge hangs overhead like an axe The cliff walls seem
impossibly straight and foreboding

SHOT - THE PATROL
Kraus has formed up the patrol They are waiting anxiously
for Dietrich and Bruggemann in the shadows along the edge of

the river

Bruggemann and Dietrich scurry down from the base of the
cliff carrying the rope and the reel of wire

Kraus springs up to meet him Everything is haste and
excitement now that success and escape are promised

LT KRAUS
Everything go all right

LT DIETRICH
Like a weekend in the Alps

SHOT - A DEMO MAN RUNS UP
He stops before the tree officers

DEMO MAN
(desperate)
Excuse me Lieutenant but we just
found these two satchel charges
They must have been mislaid in the
dark

CLOSE - DIETRICH
He frowns in despair
LT DIETRICH
(in anger)

Who as responsible for that

DEMO MAN
I dont know sir

Concentrates as if doing mathematical sums

LT DIETRICH
Very well well check into this
later You may go

DEMO MAN
(salutes)
Yes sir

He exits shot The three men stand silently

LT BRUGGEMANN
What do you think

LT DIETRICH
(after a moments pause)
I think we put enough up there to do
the job

LT BRUGGEMANN
Im sure we did

LT KRAUS
Shall I move the men out

LT DIETRICH
(disgusted with himself)
Wed better
Kraus makes an arm signal to an NCO

SHOT - THE REAR GUARD

Several men splash up the edge of the river They join the
main body

SHOT - THE MAIN PARTY

The patrol starts to move down stream They hug the shadows
along the edge of the river

SHOT - FROM ABOVE

The Germans have cleared the bridge site and have picked up
their other flank guards
SHOT - THE PATROL

Dietrich and Bruggemann are close to the front Kraus is in
the rear driving the men to keep up

silence The rounds smash into the trees and bushes around
them

SHOTS - THE GERMANS DIVE FOR COVER

BAR burst

SHOTS - THE GERMANS

at the rear of the column he stands and throws down his SMG
He wades into the river hands high
LT KRAUS
(shouting)

Kamerad
SHOT - SEVERAL MEN NEARBY FOLLOW HIS EXAMPLE
SHOT - BRUGGEMANN
He is enraged at this sight He pivots to fire at Kraus and
the others surrendering but Dietrich twists up the gun by
pushing down the stock with a blow The shots go harmlessly
into the air Dietrich rises and gestures to the men to pull
back
SHOTS - THE PATROL

In the confusion the Americans suddenly open fire again
Full rapid fire from almost a full platoon The volume of
fire is terrific

SHOT - DIETRICH

He is hit and crumples in the stream

SHOT - BRUGGEMANN

He turns and fires a burst at the Americans from his SMG
SHOTS - THE GERMANS

Seeing Dietrich fall the remainder of the Germans lose their
morale As a lull appears in the firing many shouts of
surrender come from the pinned-down patrol Then the firing
stops completely An ominous silence

LONG SHOT

Three Americans of the advance party move cautiously into
view

AMERICAN SOLDIERS

TWO SHOT - WOUNDED AMERICAN CAPTAIN and HIS LIEUTENANT

The Captain is painfully but not seriously wounded in the
arm

LIEUTENANT
How are those wounds sir

CAPTAIN JONES
(irritated)
How the hell do you think they are
They hurt like hell Did you check
the base of the cliffs and the span

LIEUTENANT
We looked it all up and down
Captain Not a damn thing

CAPTAIN JONES
(grunting)
Yeah Hows Anderson

LIEUTENANT
(grimly)
Dead

CAPTAIN JONES

Lets go question that Kraut
lieutenant

They turn and walk off

SHOT - DIETRICH and THE MEDIC

He is wounded in the arm and shoulder
Kraus is standing nearby

The two American officers come up The medic has finished
his bandaging and gets up He shrugs his shoulders at
inquiring looks from the officers The captain squats down
by Dietrich

LT DIETRICH
(engagingly)
Im sorry to see you are wounded
Captain

CAPTAIN JONES
(coldly)
Sorry I cant say the same thing
Lieutenant

LT DIETRICH
That is your privilege Captain

CAPTAIN JONES
Okay Krauthead lets skip the
bull

LT DIETRICH
Pardon me

CAPTAIN JONES
Lets get to the facts

LT DIETRICH
Of course Lieutenant Paul Dietrich
serial number 542 --

CAPTAIN JONES
(interrupting)
Skip that -- what were you doing
down here

Dietrich thinks for a moment

Dietrich feigns shock and surprise
around for a couple of beats

LT DIETRICH
(as if telling as
important secret)
We were trying to kidnap General
Eisenhower

CAPTAIN JONES
(steaming)
Was it just a coincidence we found
two explosive packs near the bridge

LT DIETRICH
We were going to blow him up

CAPTAIN JONES
(grabs Dietrichs shirt)
Dont get fancy with me Krauthead
(simmers down)
You were after the bridge werent
you

DIETRICH
What does it matter now
(sighs)
We were after the bridge

CAPTAIN JONES

(triumphantly)
I thought so

(he exchanges a

significant glance with

his lieutenant)
Listen did you actually think you
could do it with those two charges

LT DIETRICH
I beg your pardon sir But those
explosive packs are a new plastic
type equal to ten times their size
in normal explosives

CAPTAIN JONES
(sarcastic)
Funny I hadnt heard of that
(shrugs noncommittally)
Tell me thought did you actually
think you could scale those cliff
walls in the dark

LT DIETRICH

lets the idea knock
then smiles submissively
Our intelligence was misinformed
We didnt realize until we got here
that it was impossible

Captain Jones frowns for a couple of beats then stands
wearily

CAPTAIN JONES
Okay lieutenant youve been very
cooperative

LT DIETRICH
Why not sir My silence will not
win the war for us What does it
matter now You do not understand
us We are a reasonable people

The captain and the lieutenant walk a few steps away

CAPTAIN JONES
Its going to take me a little time
until I get used to the new model
talkative Kraut type

LIEUTENANT
You can have ‘em all sir

CAPTAIN JONES
(laughs)
Okay lets move em out and get

DISSOLVE TO
EXT STEEP PATH ZIG-ZAGGING UP CLIFF BRIDGE IN BG - NIGHT

Guarded by the American patrol the captured Germans are

herded up the path about 100 yards away from the bridge
Many of the prisoners stumble due to the awkward way they
have to climb -- hands clasped over heads

DISSOLVE TO
ESTABLISHING SHOTS - TOP OF BRIDGE - NIGHT

The bridge is intermittently jammed with convoys inching
across the span with supplies troops motorized artillery
and tanks

Many vehicles of all types are parked on the side of the
road as far as the eye can see waiting for higher priority
cargoes to cross

Several harried MPs direct the traffic They are
constantly abused by the drivers and the men in the trucks
held up along the road They curse back

On one side of the road is a small complex of tents Several
close to the bridge are MP billets and headquarters

Several more farther back on the edge of a small field are
the headquarters company of the engineer battalion
maintaining the bridge and the roads
The road is cut into a quagmire The passage of tanks have
torn off the asphalt surface The trucks have rutted the
under surface

The field near the tents is cut and recut with a criss-cross
of truck tracks All vegetation has been smashed flat

Several trucks and jeeps are parked haphazardly near the
tents

Off farther camouflaged by nets Three flak wagons are
dispersed to protect the bridge from non-existent German
aircraft There are no gunners in sight

SHOT - THE PRISONERS

The detail of prisoners and guards clear the top of the
cliff across the field about two hundred yards from the
tents they slowly slog across the muddy field

The Germans are a bedraggled bunch Their uniforms are
filthy from the patrol and they are unshaven The camouflage
paint streaks their face and rims their eyes like weird
makeup

Their pants flop out of their boots and here and there a few
pieces of the tape still flap around adding to the effect

Their tunics have been ripped open and their pistol belts
have been removed

SHOT - THE GUARDS and THE PRISONERS

They near the tents A gesture from a guard halts them

GUARD
(shouts)
Sitten ze here

The Germans look dumbly at him and then at the mud

He gestures threateningly with his carbine and they get the
idea They flop in the mud

SHOT - DIETRICH BRUGGEMANN and KRAUS
They drift together unobtrusively and talk in whispers

LT BRUGGEMANN
(whisper)
How much time to go

LT DIETRICH
(whisper)
About ten minutes

LT KRAUS
At least we ought to warn them to
clear the bridge

LT BRUGGEMANN
If we do that they can send someone
down to disconnect the charges
Dietrich does not even appear to be listening

LT KRAUS
I still think we should warn them

INT TENT - CAPTAIN JONES and MAJOR SULLIVAN - NIGHT

The major is a typical rear echelon officer Probably a
business executive in peacetime He is out of his element in
a situation like this

Captain Jones salutes and takes his helmet off wearily with
his unbandaged arm

MAJOR SULLIVAN
(pointing to his wound)
Say what happened there Bill

CAPTAIN JONES
Nothing much Ill go back to the
battalion aid station later

MAJOR SULLIVAN
You should watch out for that
Could get infected

CAPTAIN JONES
Sure sure Ill take care of it

Jones takes a couple of good swallows from a whiskey bottle
MAJOR SULLIVAN

Lieutenant Powers just briefed me
Youll probably get the bronze star

for this one Nineteen prisoners
Imagine they tried to blow up this
bridge

CAPTAIN JONES
Thats what the big cheese
lieutenant said But you know
there was something fishy about that
guy

MAJOR SULLIVAN
Theres something fishy about all
those guys

CAPTAIN JONES
(shrugs)
Yeah but this one was special

MAJOR SULLIVAN
(doesnt take it
seriously)
You mean you think they might have
already wired the bridge

CAPTAIN JONES
I dont think its possible -- and
yet --

MAJOR SULLIVAN
Lieutenant Powers said you found the
explosive

CAPTAIN JONES
We found two packs which they claim
was some new powerful stuff big
enough to do the job --

MAJOR SULLIVAN
(completing the thought)
But maybe it was just left over from
what they wired into the bridge

Captain Jones shrugs There is a pause as both men consider
the possibilities

CAPTAIN JONES
Our engineers claim a fly couldnt
crawl up those cliffs at night --
and yet you cant be sure

MAJOR SULLIVAN
(unconvinced)
Do you realize what youre saying

CAPTAIN JONES
Its just a hunch

MAJOR SULLIVAN
Well why not interrogate again

CAPTAIN JONES
(nodding)
I think Ill do that but first I
think we ought to stop the traffic
over the bridge

MAJOR SULLIVAN
What I cant do that on a hunch
Why do you realize the schedule
Ive got to keep up Were ten
hours behind already The colonel
will be on my tail for a month if I
ever closed the bridge on some wild
scare

CAPTAIN JONES
After whats happened just think
where youll be if that damn bridge
blows up lined with trucks wheel to
wheel

Major Sullivan rocks on his heels thoughtfully
MAJOR SULLIVAN

Youre right Youre absolutely
right The lives of those men are
much more important than any
schedule

Im sorry sir But I must claim my

LT DIETRICH
Yes sir

CAPTAIN JONES
You understand that prisoners are
often driven back in trucks

Thats really service sir We

CAPTAIN JONES
No youll be driven in nice new
comfortable trucks But we have a
system here for doing things You
have systems too in the German army
dont you

LT DIETRICH
Certainly sir

CAPTAIN JONES
Well our system is that the
prisoners assemble in the middle of
the bridge to wait for pick up by
truck

Captain Jones looks closely but sees nothing he can put his
finger on

CAPTAIN JONES
We even trust you enough to let you
march your men out there without a
guard

LT DIETRICH

Im not sure I understand what you
want me to do

Its very simple Just march your
men out to the middle of the bridge
Stop them there And wait for the
truck to come by and load you in

Come come sir This is all really
rather childish isnt it

CAPTAIN JONES

(hypnotic and powerful

You are all probably thinking the
bridge may go up any second It
could but I dont think it will
When those timing detonators are
late they are usually much later
than this one is now If we refuse
to stand on this bridge for a few
minutes they will know what we did
and immediately send some engineers
down to find the detonator They
may find it in time and all our work
will have been in vain

SHOTS - THE MENS FACES

Dietrichs words are not without effect

SHOT - KRAUS SWEATING

FOLLOW SHOT - FAVORING DIETRICH

They are almost to the middle The tension shows everywhere

LT DIETRICH
We have a nice crowd of spectators
Well show them what a German
soldier is made of Dont worry
the Americans wont keep us here
very long Theyre not really sure
the bridge is wired and this will
prove it to them

They reach the center of the bridge

LT DIETRICH
Now I want all of you to find a
place to sit comfortably I want
you to find positions that look like
youre out for a Sunday picnic
Some one of you lean over the rail
(gesturing)
Four of you sit down and play cards
(pointing)
The rest stand in groups of two or
three chatting

SHOT - SEVERAL MEN LEAN CASUALLY OVER THE RAIL THEIR FACES
PALE

SHOT - FOUR MEN TAKE OUT A PACK OF CARDS AND BEGIN PLAYING
GROTESQUE FEAR ON THEIR FACES

SHOT - THREE MORE LEAN BACK AGAINST A GIRDER ARMS FOLDED

SHOT - DIETRICH SITS ON THE RAIL AND CROSSES HIS LEGS HE
ALONE SEEMS CALM AND COLLECTED
SHOT - KRAUS TREMBLES

SHOT - SEVERAL OF THE OTHER MEN CAN BARELY KEEP FROM RUNNING
OFF THE BRIDGE

SHOT - CAPTAIN JONES and MAJOR SULLIVAN

They watch what from their distance appears to be a super
casual lounging about The Germans look as indifferent as
they could be -- at that distance

SHOT- DIETRICH HIS LEGS CROSSED

He notices the men beginning to crack Despite the casual
poses they have assumed their faces betray the ever
increasing panic and unbearable tension

LT DIETRICH
Boys weve been through a lot of
tight spots together This will be
the last one either way The war
is over and what the hell are we
going to do with ourselves anyway
This moment will last you all your
lives You will tell your
grandchildren about it and they
will tell theirs At this moment we
are living like a few men have ever
lived A man can almost thank God
he has a moment like this

SHOTS - THE MENS FACES WHILE DIETRICH HAS BEEN SPEAKING

As he speaks their faces began to glow with a weird kind of
enthusiasm and deeply stirred emotion seldom seen

CAPTAIN JONES and MAJOR SULLIVAN BACK FROM THE BRIDGE

Major Sullivan is visibly relaxed and has a kind of relieved
smile

MAJOR SULLIVAN
Well Bill I guess this wraps it
up Lets get things moving again
The trucks are really piling up

CAPTAIN JONES
One last thing I want to see how
they come back

He walks up to the entrance of the bridge and waves Dietrich
back He cups his hand to his mouth

CAPTAIN JONES
(to Dietrich)
All right Lieutenant bring your
men back

SHOT - DIETRICH WAVES RECOGNITION OF THE COMMAND

SHOTS - THE MEN SEEM TO SUDDENLY PANIC AT THE THOUGHT OF
SAFETY
SHOT - FAVORING DIETRICH

LT DIETRICH
Keep quiet Dont move I want no
hurrying We will form up just as
we came out You will follow my
tempo When we get off the bridge
make no comments no sighs of
relief Nothing to indicate
anything out of the ordinary

The men form a column Dietrich orders them forward

FOLLOW SHOT - FAVORING DIETRICH - WALKING AT EVEN TEMPO

The men seem almost unable to contain themselves The
impulse to run to safety is almost irresistible Seeing this

Dietrich plays his last gambit

LT DIETRICH
Were going to sing a song

CLOSE - DIETRICH BEGINS TO SING A STIRRING GERMAN MARCHING
SONG

CLOSE - KRAUS TRIES TO GET SOME SOUND OUT BUT BARELY MOVES
HIS LIPS

CLOSE - BRUGGEMANN JOINS IN A LOUD VOICE

SHOTS - DIFFERENT MEN AS THEY JOIN IN AND SING

LONG SHOT - OVER CAPTAIN JONES and MAJOR SULLIVAN

They watch the column of Germans marching towards them still
about 150 feet from the edge of the bridge They appear very
normal at that distance

SHOT - DIETRICH SINGING LOUDLY

SHOT - KRAUS MANAGES TO GET SOME SOUND OUT AND LOOKS PROUD

SHOTS - THE OTHERS BEGIN TO SING WITH SOME HEART AS THEY NEAR
THE EDGE OF THE BRIDGE

SUBJECTIVE SHOT - FROM THE GERMANS POV

The remaining 75 feet of the bridge rolls past and we see the
shapes of the GIs and the two officers grow larger They
watch with curiosity

LONG SHOT - THE GERMANS REACH THE END OF THE BRIDGE AND KEEP
GOING FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN YARDS DIETRICH STOPS THEM THEY DO
NOT REVEAL THEIR RELIEF THEY ARE CLEAR OF THE BRIDGE

SHOT - CAPTAIN JONES and MAJOR SULLIVAN WALK TO THE GERMAN
PRISONERS

SHOT - DIETRICH SMILES INDIFFERENTLY

CLOSE - CAPTAIN JONES - AS HE STARTS TO SPEAK HIS FACE IS
SUDDENLY BATHED IN A BRILLIANT GLARE
QUICK CUT - THE BRIDGE AS THE CHARGES EXPLODE UNDER THE
ABUTMENT

QUICK CUT - DIETRICH HAS A WIDE EYED TRIUMPHANT STARE

QUICK CUT - FROM BELOW THE BRIDGE ONE SIDE OF THE SUPPORT
CRUMBLES AS IF IN SLOW MOTION

QUICK CUT - THE SURFACE OF THE BRIDGE LAZILY CURLS AWAY FROM
THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF

QUICK CUT - FROM BELOW ONE END OF THE SPAN HURTLES DOWN INTO
THE GORGE TEARING HUGE HUNKS OUT OF THE CLIFF SIDE

SHOT - FROM BEHIND THE PRISONERS AND CAPTAIN JONES THERE IS
SUDDENLY A YAWNING GAP WHERE THE ROAD SURFACE STOOD SMOKE
AND DUST RISE FROM THE RAVINE

VARIOUS SHOTS - NOBODY SEEMS TO MOVE ALL STAND PERFECTLY
STILL AS THOUGH WITNESSING SOME AWESOME SPECTACLE OF NATURE

CLOSE - DIETRICH AS HE LOOKS INTO THE SMOKING ABYSS

The flame of excitement flickers out and is slowly replaced
by an expression that can only be described as one of
infinite sadness and nostalgia The camera holds a long time
on his face It is almost like witnessing the death of a
friend

SLOW FADE OUT
SLOW FADE IN
LONG SHOT - A BUSY STREET IN A LARGE GERMAN CITY
TITLE 10 YEARS LATER
DISSOLVE TO

EXTREME CLOSE SHOT - A MANS HAND IS RUBBER-STAMPING A LARGE
STACK OF MAIL HIS OTHER HAND DEFTLY FLICKS OFF THE TOP
ENVELOPE EXPOSING THE NEXT THE STAMP AS A THUMP THUMP
RHYTHM

CAMERA PULLS BACK - AND WE SEE THE BACK OF THE MAN SEATED AT
A LARGE MAIL TABLE IN THE BACKGROUND WE SEE THE HUSTLE AND
CLATTER OF A POST OFFICE THE MANS RHYTHM SLOWS DOWN SO
THAT THE THUMP SOUNDS GRADUALLY CEASE ALTOGETHER

MANS VOICE (0OS)
Hurry up with those letters The
four oclock truck is here soon

The man at the table turns around and we see it is Dietrich
He looks less healthy and puffier He is neatly but shabbily
dressed

LT DIETRICH
(smiles respectfully)

Excuse me Herr Bauer

He turns wearily back and resumes his work Thump Thump
CLOSE - DIETRICH

He looks down at the pile of work and sighs He resumes the
monotonous pattern of his work We hold on him doing this
for a long time The sounds of the post office swirl around
him

He tries to concentrate on the work pushing away a finished
stack of envelopes and reaching for another As he begins
the next stack his mind begins to wander again The stamping
rhythm slows down

Gradually the stamping stops completely His thoughts are
far away His face assumes the same expression of nostalgia
and melancholy we saw at the last moments of the bridge
scene He is thinking about that bridge again

The sounds of the post office fade down until they are barely
a murmur THE SOUND TRACK slowly begins to fill with the
sound of his mens voices singing the marching song they sang
walking off the bridge The sound slowly fills the screen
We hold on his face for a long long time

SLOW FADE OUT
