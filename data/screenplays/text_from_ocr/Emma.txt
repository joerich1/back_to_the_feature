INT HARTFIELD HOTHOUSE - JUST BEFORE DAWN 2

The Hartfield hothouse is an explosion of exotic colour
scarlet vermillion vivid blues and purples and pinks

EMMA WOODHOUSE 21 an intelligent spirited self-satisfied
young woman is moving through the flowers choosing the
choicest blooms for a bouquet

An eager young manservant BARTHOLOMEW holds a lantern Emma
has got him out of bed and he is struggling to stay awake

EMMA
Not that one

Her MAIDSERVANT had been about to cut the wrong flower-

EMMA (CONTD)
The next

The maidservant adjusts the secateurs and makes the cut

INT HARTFIELD MISS TAYLOR’S ROOM UPPER CORRIDOR - MORNING

MISS TAYLOR late 30s a kind gentle respectable woman is
packing up her possessions to leave Hartfield A soft knock
comes at the door and she puts down what she’s doing and
goes to it putting her face close Emma is on the other side
of the door

EMMA (0S)
(in a whisper)
How am I to bear it when you are
gone

MISS TAYLOR
(whispering too)
I am going only half a mile Emma

EMMA (0S)
But great is the difference between
a Mrs Weston half a mile away and
a Miss Taylor in the house

Miss Taylor opens the door Emma holds out a gift the
bouquet of hothouse flowers It’s exquisite

MISS TAYLOR
Dear Emma

EMMA
(sincerely)
You have been a friend and
companion such as few possess A
governess in office but little
short of a mother in affection I
wish you every happiness

They smile at each other It’s a tender moment but-—
MR WOODHOUSE (V0)

Poor Miss Taylor

INT HARTFIELD GREAT HALL - MORNING 4

MR WOODHOUSE 60s-70s a dashing fastidious fretful
valetudinarian comes into the great hall ready to depart

MR WOODHOUSE
What a pity it is that Mr Weston
ever thought of her

He’s addressing these remarks to Emma who has followed him
downstairs Her coat is already on Mr Woodhouse sits down
and Bartholomew kneels to exchange his indoor shoes for
outdoor shoes The Woodhouse BUTLER waits by the door

Emma goes to a floral arrangement by the door and breaks off
a few buds to form a sprig for her father’s lapel

EMMA
Papa Mr Weston is such a good-
humoured pleasant excellent man
He thoroughly deserves a good wife
And you would not have had Miss
Taylor live with us for ever when
she might have a house of her own

MR WOODHOUSE
A house of her own Where is the
advantage of a house of her own
This is three times as large

His shoes are on Bartholomew helps him into his coat and
then brushes down his shoulders with a coat-brush
MR WOODHOUSE (CONTD)
It is entirely unnecessary Poor
Miss Taylor- and poor Isabella too

Emma has to laugh at the absurdity of this She comes to fit
the sprig into his lapel affectionately

EMMA
My sister married seven years ago
papa you must be reconciled to it
by now

She brushes away some invisible dust that Bartholomew missed
He hovers a little miffed to have been usurped

MR WOODHOUSE
(immediately wincing)
Oh That was a terrible day We
knew then it was a terrible day We
know now it was a terrible day-

EMMA
(overriding him)
You would not wish away your
grandsons- young Henry Knightley
and little John whom you love so
well

MR WOODHOUSE
(mollified)
They are very fond of me

EMMA
Of course they are

MR WOODHOUSE
(gloomy again)
But I shall always be disappointed
they did not visit us this autumn

Bartholomew administers a few extra brushes to Mr Woodhouse’s
coat competitively while Mr Woodhouse puts on his hat

CHARLES another manservant is filling Mr Woodhouse’s cane
meticulously with lavender

EMMA
We shall see them at Christmas
papa Now we must go

Charles hands Mr Woodhouse his cane the top of which is
perforated like a salt shaker He puts it to his nose and
inhales deeply

This is the cue for the butler to open the door They go out

EXT HARTFIELD - CONTINUOUS - MORNING 5

The Woodhouse carriage is waiting to take them to the church
the coachman JAMES stands by the open door

INT WOODHOUSE CARRIAGE - MORNING 6

Mr Woodhouse looks out of the window contemplating any and
all options for delaying the wedding

EMMA

It shall always be a matter of
great joy to me that I made the
match myself Everyone said Mr
Weston would never marry again but
I did not believe it I planned the
match from the first hour of their
acquaintance and now to be proved
in the right and to have it take
place may comfort me for anything

MR WOODHOUSE
Emma you should not make matches
and foretell things Whatever you
say always comes to pass You must
not make any more

EMMA
I promise you to make none for
myself papa but I must indeed
for other people It is the
greatest amusement in the world
And after such success you know

EXT HARTFIELD GATES - CONTINUOUS - MORNING 7

Two footmen open the blue gates and the carriage passes
through Two maidservants carrying armloads of flowers part
as they see the carriage passing and curtsey

EXT HIGHBURY LANE - MORNING 8

The vicar MR ELTON mid-20s a very good-looking unctuous
deeply mercenary man is making his way to the church

He passes the schoolmistress MRS GODDARD who is leading a
crocodile of schoolgirls identically dressed in red capes
Among them is HARRIET SMITH 17 a very pretty naive
innocent girl profoundly lacking in self-confidence despite
her good looks They are all wide-eyed at the sight of Mr
Elton the most eligible bachelor in town

MRS GODDARD
Good morning Mr Elton

MR ELTON
(raising his hat)
Good morning Mrs Goddard
(to the girls)
Girls

They swoon breathless He is fully aware of the effect he is
creating and puffs himself out a little as he passes them
causing them to swoon even more Mrs Goddard is annoyed

MRS GODDARD
Come along now Quickly now

The Woodhouse carriage passes them

INTEXT WOODHOUSE CARRIAGE - MORNING 9

Emma has seen Mr Elton through the window She sits back
very pleased with herself for having formed a new plan

EMMA
One more match papa for poor Mr
Elton You like Mr Elton papa and
you know a vicar must have a wife

EXT HIGHBURY PARISH CHURCH - MORNING 10

The Woodhouse carriage stands outside the church James comes
around to help Emma and Mr Woodhouse out Theirs is the only
carriage in sight everyone else is on foot

INT HIGHBURY PARISH CHURCH - CONTINUOUS - MORNING 11

A few people are in the church already mostly seated in the
humbler pews at the back They rise hastily as Emma and her
father enter

Emma holds her head high she loves these tokens of respect
They pass MR AND MRS COLE the town’s ‘new money’-

MR COLE
(lifting his hat)
Mr Woodhouse sir Miss Woodhouse

EMMA
(judging their appearance)
Mr Cole Mrs Cole

The Coles step aside to allow the Woodhouses to pass them
and Emma leads her father into their pew at the front

MR WESTON 50s a bluff well-meaning slightly gossipy man
is at the altar facing front He’s nervous and is steeling
himself

MR WOODHOUSE
You will catch your death

He takes a blanket from beneath the pew and tucks it around
Emma’s knees

A few pews behind kind-hearted fast-talking spinster MISS
BATES 40s is seated with her mother the frail MRS BATES
70s She pipes up enthusiastically-

MISS BATES

Oh Miss Woodhouse- is this not the
most happy happy- the most
fortunate- this morning I could not
get my bonnet on for trembling

(seeing the altar cloth)
Oh my heavens do look at the altar
cloth- oh I am trembling again

Just then Mr Cole who has just sat down lets out an
almighty sneeze frightening Mr Woodhouse-

MR WOODHOUSE
Oh

He throws a hand across Emma protecting her

Emma is annoyed but propriety prevents her from saying
anything Mr Woodhouse fumbles for his cane and inhales
deeply to steady his nerves Miss Bates is oblivious

MISS BATES
Surrounded by blessings- wanting
for nothing- it is too joyful

Emma gives Miss Bates a tight smile ending the conversation
She glances back towards the door She’s waiting for someone
6A 7

MR WOODHOUSE (CONTD)

MR WOODHOUSE What is the matter Emma Why do
(peevish tucking the you turn about
anket again)
(MORE ) EMMA

I have a fancy that Mr Weston’s son
may surprise us

MR WOODHOUSE
Young Frank Weston

EMMA
(checking the door again)
He is Frank Churchill now papa He
is his uncle’s heir when he came
of age he took his uncle’s name I
so long to meet him

MR WOODHOUSE
(in a fearful whisper)
But how do you know that he might
surprise us

Mr Elton appears theatrically from a side-chapel

EMMA
It is his father’s wedding day Mr
Weston speaks of him so highly I
cannot think he will not come

But just then the church bells start to ring out and the
congregation rises on cue (all except Mrs Bates and Mr
Woodhouse who remain seated) Emma turns- and sees Miss
Taylor processing down the aisle She’s holding the bouquet
that Emma gave her and she looks radiant Mr Weston sneaks a
glance back at her Emma cannot help but smile

Miss Bates is weeping But Mr Woodhouse is too upset even to
watch them approach He’s shaking his head muttering sadly

MR WOODHOUSE
Poor Miss Taylor

Emma glances over her shoulder to check the door one last
time But it’s closing Frank Churchill has not come

Miss Taylor joins Mr Weston at the front
Mr Elton bows to the altar deeply then takes his place in

front of it his hands solemnly extended his office is a
performance to him A beat then very theatrically-

MR ELTON
Dearly beloved friends we gather
here in the sight of God to join
together this man and this woman in
holy matrimony an honourable
estate instituted by God in the
time of man’s great innocence

INT RANDALLS - AN HOUR LATER - DAY 12

Randalls is the Westons’ residence in Highbury Mr and Mrs
Weston have laid on a wedding breakfast for their friends and
neighbours Mrs Goddard has now joined them

Emma and Mrs Weston are standing together a little apart
from the crowd Mrs Weston is holding a letter

MRS WESTON
It is a very handsome letter
(beat- perceiving Emma’s
disappointment)
Mrs Churchill is in poor health
She quite depends on him

She’s putting on a brave face but she’s disappointed too

EMMA
We shall meet him very soon

She wants to keep talking but-

MR WESTON
Mrs Weston my dear

He is beckoning his wife to join him Smiling she presses
Emma’s hand and moves off to join her husband

Emma looks around at the familiar faces of Highbury Everyone
is conversing and laughing in groups She smiles disguising
the fact that she feels suddenly quite lonely

On the far side of the party Miss Bates has buttonholed Mr
Elton and is talking ceaselessly praising him for the
service and listing her blessings He is sneaking glances at
Emma and trying unsuccessfully to extricate himself

Emma glances at him thoughtfully and then looks around at
all the other women Everyone is old or middle-aged

Nearer to Emma Mrs Goddard is gossiping to MRS COX

MRS GODDARD
She was born out of wedlock to
goodness knows whom Smith is not
her real name She has no more idea
of her true relations than I do

Emma has overheard all of this but she is too proud to join
in on the village gossip The women pass out of her earshot

Mr Elton interrupts Miss Bates to suggest-

MR ELTON
Shall we have some cake ma’am

MISS BATES

(flattered blushing)
Oh Cake Sir you are too kind- I
am extremely partial to a piece of
cake- what an invitation Oh such
bounty wanting for nothing- I do
not typically have much of an
appetite but on a joyous occasion
such as this one feels almost rude
not to join in the edible
celebration-

She comes over to the table and picks up a plate of cake But
Mr Woodhouse is highly distressed and intercepts-

MR WOODHOUSE
Wedding-cake is sure to disagree
with you Miss Bates I do not
advise your even tasting it

Miss Bates hesitates She wants the cake but she doesn’t
want to upset Mr Woodhouse At last sadly and regretfully
she puts the plate back

Emma watches her feeling lonelier than ever

EXT DONWELL ABBEY - LATE AFTERNOON 13

A man on horseback gallops down a shaded avenue to the
handsome DONWELL ABBEY a grander more Gothic house than
Hartfield It looks preserved rather than lived-in

The rider is GEORGE KNIGHTLEY 30s a cheerful intelligent
morally conscious man He’s sweaty from his ride

A GROOM is waiting The groom takes the bridle to lead the
horse away and Mr Knightley heads inside to wash

9A

INT DONWELL ABBEY MR KNIGHTLEY’S ROOM - LATER - LATE 14
AFTERNOON

Mr Knightley now bathed is being dressed by his VALET This
room looks properly inhabited it’s cosy with books and
papers everywhere

INT DONWELL ABBEY BEDROOM DOUBLE CUBE SINGLE CUBE 15
STATUE HALL - CONTINUOUS - LATE AFTERNOON

Mr Knightley now dressed in clean clothes is walking
through the cavernous space The furniture is all dust-
sheeted and the chandeliers are bagged Footmen are lighting
candles in the background

His housekeeper MRS REYNOLDS intercepts him ruefully-

MRS REYNOLDS
You know what I’m about to say sir-

MR KNIGHTLEY
“-Why do you keep a carriage if you
never put it out”

He smiles at her unrepentant

MRS REYNOLDS
It’s just such a shame to see it
standing by
(changing tack)
A gentleman on foot- it’s unusual

He says the word ‘unusual’ with her Laughing he goes out

MR KNIGHTLEY
Good evening Mrs Reynolds

MRS REYNOLDS
(calling after him)
It would be a kindness to the
driver Just every now and again

EXT DONWELL ABBEY - SUNSET 16

Mr Knightley exits on foot and sets off through the grounds
still smiling enjoying the exercise

INT HARTFIELD GOLD DRAWING ROOM - AN HOUR LATER - EVENING 17

Mr Woodhouse is asleep in his habitual armchair snoring
softly Emma is re-reading the letter from Frank Churchill
She hears footfalls and looks up to see through the window
that Mr Knightley is approaching Wanting to appear occupied
when he comes in she puts down the letter hurries through
to the music room sits down at the piano and begins to play

The sound of the piano startles Mr Woodhouse awake

Mr Knightley comes in Mr Woodhouse is pleased to see him

MR WOODHOUSE
Mr Knightley You must have had a
shocking walk

MR KNIGHTLEY
Not at all sir It is a beautiful
balmy evening

MR KNIGHTLEY (CONTD)
(seeing Emma’s expression)
He did not come

He sees the letter on the sofa next to her and picks it up
MR WOODHOUSE

Emma bears everything very well
but Mr Knightley she is really

Mr Knightley feels at home at Hartfield He goes at once to
his habitual chair next to Mr Woodhouse and sits down

Emma wanting to annoy him plays a discordant note on the
piano just as he sits down as a rude sound effect He shoots
her a look and she innocently busies herself with the music

very sorry to lose poor Miss
Taylor

MR KNIGHTLEY
Poor Mr and Miss Woodhouse if you
please but I cannot accept ‘poor

MR WOODHOUSE
But you must have found it very
damp and dirty

MR KNIGHTLEY
Dirty sir Look at my boots Not a
speck on them How do you do I
came to wish you joy

MR WOODHOUSE
Joy
(wincing)
Oh The wedding Terrible day

Miss Taylor’- on her wedding-day

He turns his attention back to the letter Emma is watching
him closely

EMMA
He wished exceedingly to come but
his aunt and uncle could not spare
him

Mr Knightley starts reading the letter a little sceptically
Mr Woodhouse gets up it’s the time of the night when

Bartholomew sets up the backgammon table and Mr Woodhouse
needs to find the perfect spot to set it up

MR KNIGHTLEY
(to Emma)
So how did you all behave Who
cried most

Emma has become bored with her pretend piano practice She
leaves the music room and comes back to join them

EMMA
We all behaved charmingly
Everybody was in their best looks
Not a tear and hardly a long face
to be seen

MR WOODHOUSE
(to Bartholomew)
Bring that screen a little closer
Mr Knightley feels a chill

Bartholomew hastens to bring the screen forward

MR KNIGHTLEY
And what of Mr Frank Churchill Is
he every bit as handsome as his
father promised he would be
(MORE )

MR KNIGHTLEY
Well I dare say he might have come
if he could

EMMA
I do not know why you should say
so

MR KNIGHTLEY
If Frank Churchill had wanted to
attend his father’s wedding he
would have contrived it He chose
not to come

EMMA
It is very unfair to judge of any
body’s conduct without an intimate
knowledge of their situation We
have never met Mr Frank Churchill
we do not know what he is able and
unable to do

MR KNIGHTLEY
There is one thing Emma which a
man can always do if he chooses
and that is his duty It is Frank
Churchill’s duty to pay this
attention to his father

EMMA
He also has a duty to his aunt who
is unwell

MR KNIGHTLEY

Mrs Churchill has been unwell for
as long as she could say so Her
nephew is not a doctor If he had
told her simply and resolutely
that he must attend his father’s
wedding there would have been no
opposition to his going

EMMA

(laughing)
No but there might have been some
to his coming back again You are
the worst judge in the world Mr
Knightley of the difficulties of
dependence You have always been
your own master You do not know
what it is to have tempers to
manage

MR KNIGHTLEY
I shall remember that next time you
quarrel with me

Tossing her head pettishly she gets up and relocates to a
chair on the other side of the folding screen so that he now
can’t see her A beat- and then she reaches one hand over the
screen and plucks Frank Churchill’s letter out of his hand

INT HARTFIELD EMMA’S ROOM - MORNING 18

Emma’s maidservant is helping her to dress first layers and
layers of petticoats then the gauzy outermost gown

After the maidservant has gone she goes to the fire and
completely unself-consciously lifts up her skirts to warm
her bare bottom by the fire which is lit in the grate A
beat She feels alone

18A

OMITTED 18A

INT HARTFIELD DINING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER - MORNING 19

Mr Woodhouse is reading the paper as he eats breakfast Emma
sits opposite She’s bored An empty chair between them shows
where Miss Taylor used to sit Bartholomew waits discreetly

EMMA
There is a new parlour-boarder at
Mrs Goddard’s school papa Miss
Smith

Mr Woodhouse whips around electric and points to the wall

MR WOODHOUSE
There Distinctly

Bartholomew hesitates then goes to the place where Mr
Woodhouse is pointing and places his hands on the wall

MR WOODHOUSE (CONTD)
Do you feel it A chill draught
(then more impressively)
A chill and sickly draught

EMMA
(trying again)
She is a natural child No one
knows her parentage not even Miss
Smith herself Is that not
mysterious

It’s just the sort of topic that Miss Taylor would have taken
up But Mr Woodhouse is still focused on Bartholomew who
can’t feel anything but is loyally trying his best

MR WOODHOUSE
Miss Taylor would have felt it

EXT MRS GODDARDS SCHOOL - DAY 20

Emma is speaking with Mrs Goddard on the lawn in front of the
school

MRS GODDARD
(doubtfully)
Miss Smith
(MORE )

MRS GODDARD (CONTD)
does not know the circumstances of
her birth Miss Woodhouse

EMMA
(carelessly)
A fact which surely proves her
parentage is good If her origins
were very low there would have
been no need for secrecy for there
would have been no shame

Again Mrs Goddard hesitates- this is awfully presumptuous
and even a little cruel But Emma has made up her mind

EMMA (CONTD)
I will improve her Those natural
graces must not be wasted she
wants only a little elegance I
think to be quite perfect Will
you send her to Hartfield Mrs
Goddard Tomorrow morning

Mrs Goddard curtseys in a way that is not quite sincere

MRS GODDARD
You are very kind Miss Woodhouse

Emma satisfied leaves her to continue on

EXTINT HARTFIELD COURTYARDGREAT HALL - THE NEXT MORNING 21
DAY

Harriet enters Hartfield alone completely dwarfed by its
grandeur and stately beauty She looks around her losing
confidence

INT HARTFIELD MINT DRAWING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER - DAY 22

Harriet faces Emma across the vastly opulent Hartfield
drawing room She is positively terrified

EMMA
The misfortune of your birth
Harriet ought to make you
particularly careful as to your
associates

The door opens and the butler maidservant and Bartholomew
come in The butler is carrying a trestle-table the
maidservant a tea-tray and Bartholomew an urn Harriet is
instantly on edge Emma doesn’t notice

EMMA (CONTD)
There can be no doubt of your being
a gentleman’s daughter You must
support your claim to that station
by every thing within your power

While she talks she unlocks the tea caddy and then watches
as the servant measures out the tea Bartholomew adds hot
water and then the servants melt away again

HARRIET
Know you the Martins Miss
Woodhouse- of Abbey Mill Farm

EMMA
I know that they are tenant
farmers They rent their farm from
Mr Knightley

Harriet doesn’t catch the snobbish note and bumbles on

HARRIET
They were ever so kind to me this
summer I stayed for two months
together When I went away Mrs
Martin was so very kind as to send
Mrs Goddard a beautiful goose the
finest goose Mrs Goddard had ever
seen she said She had it dressed
on a Sunday and asked all of us to
sup with her- and I declare Miss
Woodhouse I had never tasted
anything so fine

She’s gabbling trying to be impressive Emma hands her a
teacup and begins cutting the cake

EMMA
The Martins are of precisely the
order of people with whom I feel I
can have nothing to do A degree or
two lower might interest me if
they were very poor I might hope
to be useful to them in some way
But a farmer can need none of my
help and is therefore as much
above my notice as he is below it

This neat piece of rhetoric goes right over Harriet’s head
while Emma has been talking Harriet has realised to her
horror that her finger is stuck in the delicate china handle
of the teacup She manages to pop it free just in time to
accept a plate of cake

HARRIET
Mr Robert Martin went three miles
one day to bring me walnuts
because he knew how fond I was of
them I believe he’s very clever
He understands every thing

EMMA
I suppose he does not read

HARRIET

Oh yes That is- I believe he has
read a good deal- he reads the
Agricultural Reports- and I know he
has read The Vicar of Wakefield He
had never even heard of The Romance
of the Forest nor The Children of
the Abbey until I mentioned them

Emma feels a little envious of Harriet’s patent crush- which
is more than she has ever felt for anyone- but she hides her
envy behind a mask of cool detachment changing the subject

EMMA
After tea we will call on my dear
Mrs Weston We promised we should
be seeing one another every day

INT RANDALLS DRAWING ROOM - DAY 23

The room is plain but homey showing a bachelor’s tastes to
which a few feminine touches have recently been added

Mrs Weston had been sitting with Mr Elton They both rise as
the door opens and Emma and Harriet come in Really it ought
to be Mrs Weston the hostess who speaks first but

EMMA
I am not the first to visit you

MRS WESTON
(laughing)
You are no less welcome for being
the second

EMMA
Mr Elton Miss Harriet Smith

MR ELTON
(with a flourish)
It is my great honour

EMMA
You must sit there Harriet so
that you may admire the view of
Enscombe over the fire

Harriet hesitates isn’t Emma usurping Mrs Weston But Mrs
Weston smiles indulgently so Harriet sits down where Emma
indicates and obediently looks at the picture

EMMA (CONTD)
Mr Frank Churchill is the artist

It is of a handsome country house and is signed F CHURCHILL

MR ELTON
I have heard it described as one of
the finest houses in Yorkshire

MRS WESTON
I have heard the same though for
Mr Weston’s sake I would that it
were closer by

MR ELTON
And Mr Churchill is to inherit the
entire estate

MRS WESTON
He is very fortunate

EMMA
(to Harriet)
There is such symmetry between us
We both lost our mothers when we
were very young and he has his
aunt to care for as I have papa

Mr Elton feels a pang of envy and changes the subject
turning back to the girls with a flourish-

MR ELTON
But how can we admire a painted
beauty with such loveliness before
us in the flesh

EMMA
(smiling at him)
We must have you to Hartfield Mr
Elton

MR ELTON
I can conceive no greater pleasure

EXT HIGHBURY LANE NEAR HARTFIELD - LATE AFTERNOON - DAY 24

Emma and Harriet are walking home together

EMMA

Mr Elton is a such a good humoured
man So cheerful and obliging and

gentle I think very well of Mr
Elton

Harriet glances at her uncertainly wondering if Emma is

trying to tell her something in a coded way

HARRIET
I do so wonder Miss Woodhouse

that you should not be going to be

married So charming as you are

She winces- has she overstepped But Emma laughs

EMMA

A person’s being charming Harriet
is not quite enough to induce them

to marry they must find another
person charming too I have none
of the usual inducements of women
to marry Fortune I do not want
employment I do not want
consequence I do not want I

believe few married women are half
as much mistress of their husband’s

house as I am of Hartfield and

never could I expect to be so truly

beloved and important so always

first and always right in any man’s

eyes as I am in my father’s

They’ve reached the Hartfield gates They stop and Emma puts

out her hand regally for Harriet to take

EMMA (CONTD)
You must come again tomorrow

HARRIET
(overcome )
Oh Miss Woodhouse Thank you

She curtseys and walks off Emma watches her go

EXT HIGHBURY MARKET SQUARE - A FEW DAYS LATER - MORNING

Emma and Harriet are out walking through the quaint town

centre of Highbury They pass into Ford’s the haberdasher

INT FORDS HABERDASHER - A LITTLE LATER - DAY 26

Harriet and Emma are shopping Emma has already made her
purchase and Harriet is infuriating her by taking a long
time to decide between two almost identical ribbons

HARRIET
The dark blue or the light Miss
Woodhouse which do you prefer

EMMA
(repressing irritation)
They are nearly identical

HARRIET
(still dithering)
Of course if the dark gets dirty
it will not show but the light-

EMMA
The dark then

HARRIET
The light is a good deal prettier

Emma perceives Miss Bates peering through the window at them
and groans audibly Harriet is instantly alarmed

HARRIET (CONTD)
What is the matter Miss Woodhouse
Are you ill

But there’s no time to reply Miss Bates comes in breathless-—

MISS BATES
Miss Woodhouse How do you do- and
you Miss Smith- I saw you through
the window- Miss Woodhouse I bring
happy news- such happy news- we
have had a letter this very morning
from my niece Jane Fairfax

EMMA
I hope that she is well

She turns away and goes to continue shopping But Miss Bates
follows her around the store not letting her escape-

MISS BATES
In normal course she writes
Tuesday or Wednesday but here it
is today so very unexpected-
(hearing Emma belatedly)
(MORE )
MISS BATES (CONTD)
Oh Miss Woodhouse you are so very
kind to inquire Her health- poor
Jane- she is at Weymouth with
Colonel Campbell and-

(hunting in her bag for

the letter)
Oh where is the letter It must
not be far off- such an unexpected-

Harriet has turned back to the ribbons

HARRIET
(to herself)
For winter perhaps the dark is best-

MISS BATES

(finding it)
Ah- it had got lost under the-

(passing it to Emma who

takes it reluctantly)
-yes Weymouth with Colonel
Campbell and his wife and her
dear friend Miss Campbell who is
recently married she is Mrs Dixon
now

Emma has scanned the letter very briefly and holds it out
for Miss Bates to take but Miss Bates has changed the
subject so Emma puts it down on the counter between them

MISS BATES (CONT’D)
And oh- oh dear Mr Dixon- the most
charming young man- rendered Jane a
great service in recent days
They were out in a party on the
water and Jane by the sudden
whirling round of something or
other among the sails would have
been dashed to the sea at once- and
actually was all but gone- but Mr
Dixon with the greatest presence
of mind caught hold of her habit
and saved her life

Harriet gasps Miss Bates turns thrilled to discover that
Harriet is listening and reaches out her hand to clasp
Harriet’s Her eyes fill with sympathetic tears

MISS BATES (CONT’D)
To think that poor Jane might have
perished I cannot think of it
without trembling She an orphan I
shall always be very very fond of
Mr Dixon now

EMMA
I am very glad that Miss Fairfax
was not harmed

MISS BATES
(quivering with gratitude)
You are too kind I shall write to
Jane this very day
(MORE )
21a

MISS BATES (CONTD)
How very gratified Jane will be to
know that she has such dear
devoted friends

She goes to leave then realises she has left the letter and
returns for it

MISS BATES (CONTD)
Such devoted friends

EXT HIGHBURY LANE - FIVE MINUTES LATER - DAY 27

Emma and Harriet are returning to Hartfield

EMMA

Heaven forbid that I should ever
bore people half as much about all
the Knightleys together as Miss
Bates does about Jane Fairfax One
is sick of the very name of Jane
Fairfax Every letter from her is
read forty times over and if she
does but knit a pair of garters
one hears of nothing else for a
month I wish Jane Fairfax very
well but she tires me to death

But Harriet has stopped walking Emma surprised stops too
and follows Harriet’s gaze She sees in the field opposite
the strapping young farmer ROBERT MARTIN He had been tilling
the ground but seeing Harriet he puts down his plough and
strides over to the fence to greet her grinning broadly

HARRIET
It is Robert Martin

She dashes to the fence to greet him Emma left alone looks
on with patent disapproval After a brief and evidently good-
natured exchange Harriet runs back to Emma beaming-

HARRIET (CONTD)
Only think of our happening to meet
him Well Miss Woodhouse is he
like what you expected What do you
think of him

Robert Martin has returned to his plough now he resumes his
work strongly conscious of the ladies’ presence Emma
watches him coolly for a moment then resumes walking
Harriet falls into step beside her A beat then-

EMMA
I had no right to expect much and
I did not expect much but I had no
idea that he could be so very
clownish so totally without air I
had imagined him I confess a
degree or two nearer gentility

Harriet is crestfallen
HARRIET

To be sure- he is not so genteel as
a real gentleman

Emma sweeps on ahead Harriet hurries to catch up with her

INT HARTFIELD GOLD DRAWING ROOM - EVENING 28

Emma is showing Harriet the letter from Frank Churchill Mr
Knightley sits in his habitual armchair reading but without
attention he’s distracted by the girls

EMMA
You see he signs ‘Mr F C Weston
Churchill’ Is that not fine

But Harriet too is distracted In the room beyond Mr
Woodhouse is being attended to by the apothecary MR PERRY
who is supplying him with new potions and tinctures to test

HARRIET
(to Emma in a whisper)
I do hope Mr Woodhouse is not ill

EMMA
Oh papa sees Mr Perry every day I
know I disappoint him awfully- I am
so seldom indisposed If he does
not invent an illness for me I
hardly figure in his letters

Mr Knightley smiles at this but it goes over Harriet’s head

HARRIET
Truly you are the very picture of
good health Miss Woodhouse
(then blurting out)
Mrs Martin thinks you the most
handsome woman in all of Highbury

Emma busies herself putting Frank’s letter away in her
embroidered letter-case

EMMA
You must never flatter me in Mr
Knightley’s hearing Harriet He
thinks me vain enough already

MR KNIGHTLEY

(after a beat)
I do not think you personally vain
Considering how very handsome you
are you seem little occupied with
it

(with a glance at Harriet)
Your vanity lies a different way

Harriet is aghast But Emma smothers a smile She has only
heard the compliment After a beat very casually but
dropping her voice to a whisper so Mr Knightley can’t hear

EMMA
Did I tell you what Mr Elton said
of you the other day He called you
‘loveliness itself’

Harriet looks sharply at her disbelieving Emma smiles

EMMA (CONTD)
(still in a whisper)
It seems to me his manners are
rather softer than they used to be
I rather wonder if he means to
ingratiate himself with you

In the next room Mr Woodhouse is still talking to Mr Perry
MR WOODHOUSE

Now an egg boiled very soft Mr
Perry that is a remedy

INT RANDALLS SMALL HALL - THE NEXT DAY - DAY 29

Mr Knightley is standing in the window fidgeting There is
something he wants to raise with Mrs Weston who is on the
adjacent window seat but he isn’t sure how to phrase it

MR KNIGHTLEY
I do not know what your opinion may
be Mrs Weston of this great
intimacy between Emma and Harriet
Smith but I think it a bad thing

MRS WESTON
(very surprised)
How differently we feel

MR KNIGHTLEY
Miss Smith knows nothing about
herself and looks upon Emma as
knowing every thing Her ignorance
is hourly flattery How can Emma
imagine she has anything to learn
while Harriet is presenting such a
delightful inferiority

MRS WESTON
But educating Harriet will be an
inducement for Emma to educate
herself They will read together
He laughs

MR KNIGHTLEY
Emma has been meaning to read more
ever since she was twelve years
old She never would submit to
anything requiring industry and
patience

MRS WESTON
I am sure you always thought me
unfit to be her governess

MR KNIGHTLEY

Yes you are better placed here-
very fit for a wife but not at all
for a governess You were preparing
yourself to be an excellent wife
all the time you were at Hartfield
by submitting your own will and
doing just as you were bid

MRS WESTON
And yet you came today on purpose
to solicit my opinion knowing my
husband to be out you do not treat
me as a wife Mr Knightley but I
dare say as a governess

pleased to have been bested

MRS WESTON (CONTD)
I cannot allow you to be a judge in
this matter Mr Knightley You are
so used to live alone you do not
know the value of a companion

MR KNIGHTLEY

(brooding)
She always declares that she will
never marry which of course
means just nothing at all I should
like to see Emma in love and in
some doubt of a return it would do
her good

MRS WESTON
That I must answer as a wife
There are wishes in this house
respecting Emma’s destiny

Mrs Weston smiles meaningfully at him and glances at the
picture of Enscombe over the fire

INT HARTFIELD MUSIC ROOM - A FEW DAYS LATER - DAY 30

Mr Elton is leafing through Emma’s portfolio which contains
mostly sketches of Hartfield and portraits of her family
None of them are finished Emma is at Mr Elton’s shoulder
Harriet sits nearby feeling a little like a third wheel

MR ELTON
But these are exquisitely done
Miss Woodhouse You have a charming
talent

EMMA
(carelessly)
I dare say there is merit in them
in the least finished perhaps the
most So Mr Knightley tells me He
finds fault in everything I do

She’s talking about herself too much She remembers Harriet

EMMA (CONTD)
Did you ever have your likeness
taken Harriet

HARRIET
(with alarm)
Oh dear- no never

EMMA
(to Mr Elton)
What an exquisite possession a good
picture of her would be

MR ELTON
It would indeed

It isn’t much of a compliment but Harriet dares to feel a
flush of pleasure Emma waits and Mr Elton takes the hint-

MR ELTON (CONT’D)

It would indeed Let me entreat
you Miss Woodhouse- now at once

INT HARTFIELD MINT DRAWING ROOM - LATER - DAY 31

Emma is at the easel applying paint to a sketch the picture
is now very well advanced Mr Elton is at her elbow Harriet
is posing against a folding screen that has been painted with
a pastoral scene She is trying her best to keep still

MR ELTON
You have given Miss Smith all that
she required She was a beautiful
creature when she came to you but
the attractions you have added are
infinitely superior to what she
received from nature

EMMA
I am glad you think I have been
useful to her but Harriet only
wanted drawing out I have done
very little

MR ELTON
If it were admissable to contradict
a lady-

EMMA

I have perhaps given her a little
more decision of character I have
taught her to think on points which
had not fallen in her way before

MR ELTON
Skilful has been the hand

EMMA
Great has been the pleasure I am
sure I never met with a
disposition more truly amiable

Mr Knightley and Mr Woodhouse come in from outside Mr Elton
greets them with a flourish-

MR ELTON
Mr Woodhouse Your daughter’s gifts
are without compare Bear witness

Mr Knightley looks at the picture sceptically

MR KNIGHTLEY
You have made her too tall Emma

MR ELTON
Oh no Certainly not too tall not
in the least too tall It gives one
exactly the idea of such a height
as Miss Smith’s Exactly so

Mr Knightley glances at him doubtfully but Emma is looking
at Harriet who is still obediently holding her pose Both
women are highly gratified by Mr Elton’s enthusiasm

31A

MR ELTON (CONT’D)
A most perfect resemblance in every
feature I never saw such a
likeness in my life

MR WOODHOUSE
It is very pretty When it is
finished you must have it framed

MR ELTON
Allow me Trust me with this
commission Miss Woodhouse and I
will ride to London the moment I am
asked It would be my great honour

MR WOODHOUSE
(dubious)
London

Mr Knightley is looking at Mr Elton with patent disdain But
Harriet is flushed with pleasure Emma’s eyes are sparkling

CUT TO

A short while later Harriet and Emma look on as Mr Elton
takes the painting and rolls it in a leather tube

MR ELTON
(bowing to them)
Miss Woodhouse Miss Smith

He takes his leave waving to them As soon as he’s gone
Emma takes Harriet’s arm and leans in close

EMMA
I cannot have a moment’s doubt
about his intentions It is just as
I planned he is in love with you

Harriet hardly dares to believe it She manages a smile

EXT HARTFIELD - DAY 31A

Bartholomew holds the horse’s bridle for Mr Elton while he
stows away the leather tube in his saddlebag He goes to
mount his horse But his balance is a little off and he
can’t quite swing himself up Bartholomew has to come and
help him He slithers a little using Bartholomew’s shoulder
to lever himself up but it takes a good few seconds until
he’s up in the saddle He trots off

28A

EXT ABBEY MILL LANE - VERY EARLY MORNING 32

Mr Knightley on horseback is making for the modest
farmhouse at the end of the lane which appears to be very
comfortably lived-in The cottage garden is flourishing and
well tended pegged laundry flaps in the breeze geese and
hens peck about in the yard

MRS MARTIN is peeling apples on the step Her daughters
ELIZABETH and CATHERINE are doing laundry together nearby

They see Mr Knightley approaching Elizabeth puts down what
she’s doing and goes into the house to tell her brother

Seconds later Robert comes out of the house pulling on his
jacket as Mr Knightley rides up He’s glowing with exertion

MR KNIGHTLEY
The day’s wasting Mr Martin Come
along

Robert scuttles off to the barn to saddle up his horse Mr
Knightley doesn’t wait He turns his horse around and trots
off down the road expecting Robert will catch up Soon
Robert leads a horse out of the stable swings himself up
into the saddle and rides off after his landlord

OMITTED 33

EXT LANE NEAR ABBEY MILL FARM - NEARING SUNSET 34

Robert Martin and Mr Knightley are following a flock of sheep
down a country road

ROBERT MARTIN
I’m really most obliged to you
sir I’d expected to wait until the
spring

MR KNIGHTLEY
Always buy out of season Mr
Martin whenever you can

Robert glances at him taking this advice to heart Then-

ROBERT MARTIN
Mr Knightley sir
(beat)
Forgive my liberty- but- may I be
so bold as to seek your advice

INT EMMAS DRESSING ROOM AT HARTFIELD - THE NEXT DAY - DAY5

Emma in her dressing room is being fitted for a winter coat
by the haberdasher MRS FORD Emma is wearing a mock-up and
Mrs Ford is busily altering the garment to fit

The door opens and Harriet bursts in carrying a letter

HARRIET
Miss Woodhouse- you will never
guess what has happened- Robert
Martin has offered me his hand
(then suddenly)
Hic

She is so breathless with excitement that she has given
herself the hiccups She rushes on fumbling with the letter-

HARRIET (CONTD)
He writes as if he really loves me
very much Hic I came as fast as I
could to ask you what I should do
Hic

Mrs Ford glances at her quickly and then resumes work on
Emma’s hem Harriet is now comfortable enough at Hartfield
not to pay attention to the servants and doesn’t notice She
comes forward holding out the letter-

HARRIET (CONTD)
Will you read it Hic

EMMA
Take a deep breath and hold it

Harriet obliges Emma begins to read the letter A long beat
and then Harriet exhales noisily to ask-

HARRIET
(anxiously)
Is it a good letter Or too short

It is in fact a good letter Emma is surprised

EMMA
A very good letter- so good that I
think one of his sisters must have
helped him

HARRIET
What shall I do Hic

EMMA
Hold your nose

HARRIET
(holding her nose)
About the letter

EMMA
You must answer it of course

HARRIET
But what shall I say Dear Miss
Woodhouse do advise me

EMMA
(handing back the letter)
Oh no no The words must be your
own But you must be unequivocal
You must express gratitude concern
for the pain you are inflicting
and sorrow for his disappointment

She takes off the mocked-up coat and hands it to Mrs Ford
who curtseys and withdraws glancing at Harriet dubiously as
she does so Harriet’s hiccups seem to have subsided

HARRIET
You think I ought to refuse him

EMMA
My dear Harriet what do you mean
Are you in any doubt as to that

HARRIET
II had no notion that he liked
me so very much Hic

EMMA
I lay it down as a general rule
Harriet that if a woman doubts as
to whether she should accept a man
or not she certainly ought to
refuse him But do not imagine that
I want to influence you

HARRIET
Hic Perhaps it will be
safer Do you think I had better
say ‘No’ Hic

EMMA
Not for the world would I advise
you either way You must be the
best judge of your own happiness
If you prefer Mr Martin to every
other person

(MORE )

EMMA (CONTD)
if you think him the most agreeable
man you have ever met why should
you hesitate

HARRIET
I have now quite determined and
really almost made up my mind-
(tiny beat)
-to refuse Mr Martin Do you think
I am right Hic 37

EMMA

(with great relief)
Perfectly perfectly right dear
Harriet While you were all in
suspense I kept my feelings to
myself but now that you are
decided I have no hesitation in
approving I give myself joy of
this It would have grieved me to
lose you I could not have visited
Mrs Robert Martin of Abbey-Mill
Farm

HARRIET
You could not have visited me

The horror of this prospect has frightened the hiccups away

EMMA

It would have been a severe pang to
lose your acquaintance but so it
must have been You would have
thrown yourself out of all good
society I must have given you up

(beat- then pleased)
There They’ve subsided

INT HARTFIELD GOLD DRAWING ROOM - DAY 36

Mr Woodhouse is directing Bartholomew and Charles to
position the folding-screens around him to block the draught
They are over-eager to please

They shut the front flaps boxing him in completely
MR WOODHOUSE
Not the-
(protesting)
It’s dark in here

Hurriedly they unbox him again He’s highly disgruntled-

MR WOODHOUSE (CONTD)
How am I supposed to read in the
dark
(beat- they’re flummoxed)
Well go and fetch a candle

They both set off running

INT HARTFIELD STAIRCASE ENTRANCE - LATER - DAY 37

Emma is descending the staircase when Mr Knightley steps in
through the front door He’s in a very good mood

MR KNIGHTLEY
I just passed Miss Smith

EMMA
She has gone home with a complaint

MR KNIGHTLEY
Well I am sorry to hear it but I
have reason to believe she will
soon be feeling rather better Mr
Robert Martin sought my opinion
yesterday-can you guess what about

Emma knows what’s coming She goes through to the dining
room and Mr Knightley still cheerful follows

MR KNIGHTLEY (CONTD)
You will not guess

EMMA

Mr Martin proposed to Harriet this
morning He wrote and was refused

INT HARTFIELD DINING ROOM - FIVE MINUTES LATER - DAY 38

The Woodhouse family silver is out having recently been
cleaned and polished Emma wanting to occupy herself has
begun examining the inventory and checking everything is
there

MR KNIGHTLEY
Refused Then she is a greater
simpleton than I ever believed her
Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin
I hope you are mistaken

EMMA
I saw her answer nothing could be
clearer
MR KNIGHTLEY
You saw her answer You wrote her
answer This is your doing Emma
You persuaded her to refuse him

33A

EMMA
If I did I should not feel that I
had done wrong Mr Martin is a
respectable young man but I cannot
admit him to be Harriet’s equal

They are circling one another around the table

MR KNIGHTLEY

Not Harriet’s equal No indeed he
is her superior in both sense and
situation Emma your infatuation
about that girl blinds you What
are Harriet Smith’s claims either
of birth nature or education to
any connection higher than Robert
Martin She is the natural daughter
of nobody knows whom with probably
no settled provision at all and
certainly no respectable relations

Emma had begun to interrupt him at ‘nobody knows whom’-

EMMA
There can scarcely be a doubt that
her father is a gentleman and a
gentleman of fortune Her allowance
is very liberal nothing has been
grudged for her improvement

She leaves the room But Mr Knightley follows her

INT HARTFIELD GOLD DRAWING ROOM - DAY

Mr Woodhouse is distressed he has left the door open

MR WOODHOUSE
The draught- he does not think of
the draught- Bartholomew Charles

Bartholomew is coming back with the candle He sprints to

close the door

INT HARTFIELD MUSIC ROOM - DAY

Mr Knightley and Emma have not paused

MR KNIGHTLEY
She is known only as a parlour-
boarder at a common school She is
pretty and she is good tempered
and that is all

EMMA
‘That is all’ These are not
trivial recommendations Mr
Knightley Till men do fall in love
with well-informed minds instead of
handsome faces a girl with such
loveliness as Harriet has a
certainty of being admired and
sought after wherever she goes I
am very much mistaken if your sex
in general would not think such
qualities the highest claims a
woman could possess

MR KNIGHTLEY
Upon my word Emma to hear you
abusing the reason you have is
almost enough to make me think so
too Better to be without sense
altogether than to misapply it as
you do

Emma is taken aback Mr Knightley has never spoken so harshly

to her before At a loss she turns and goes out But he
still isn’t done He follows her

INT HARTFIELD GOLD DRAWING ROOM - DAY 41

Mr Woodhouse sees that the door has been left open again

MR WOODHOUSE
Mr Knightley- I beg you

Mr Knightley bows to Mr Woodhouse tightly and closes the
door but he’s still on Emma’s heels

INT HARTFIELD DINING ROOM - DAY 42

MR KNIGHTLEY
Men of sense whatever you may
choose to say do not want silly
wives Men of family would not be
very fond of connecting themselves
with a girl of such obscurity- and
more prudent men would be afraid of
the inconvenience and disgrace that
they might be involved in when the
mystery of her parentage came to be
revealed Let her marry Robert
Martin and she is safe and
respectable for ever

(MORE )

MR KNIGHTLEY (CONTD)
but if you teach her to expect to
marry greatly nobody within her
reach will ever be good enough for
her

Emma’s jaw is set Mr Knightley is still pursuing her

MR KNIGHTLEY (CONT’D)
(intensely)

Your plans for Harriet are best
known to yourself but as you make
no secret of your love of match-
making it is fair to suppose that
plans you have and as a friend I
shall just hint to you that if
Elton is the man I think it will
be all labour in vain Elton knows
the value of a good income as well
as anybody He may talk
sentimentally but he will act
rationally He knows that he is a
very handsome young man and a
great favourite wherever he goes
and from his general way of talking
when there are only men present I
am convinced that he does not mean
to throw himself away

And at last Emma has had enough She faces him fierce

EMMA
I am very much obliged to you for
opening my eyes Mr Knightley but
know that I am done with match-
making for the present I only want
to keep Harriet to myself

She knows this sounds selfish as soon as it’s out of her

mouth Mr Knightley is too disgusted and angry to speak He
opens the door bows stiffly to Emma and leaves

INT HARTFIELD MINT DRAWING ROOM - DAY 43

Mr Elton has returned from London with the framed portrait
It is wrapped in paper and set up on an easel With a
flourish he sloughs off the paper and displays it to
Harriet Emma and Mr Woodhouse

They gape at it The frame that Mr Elton has chosen is
completely tasteless and utterly wrong for the picture it’s
ornate gilt too heavy But there’s more Mr Elton cranks a
tiny handle and a music box hidden in the frame starts to
play Emma can’t imagine anything worse But-—

HARRIET 46
(in wonderment)
Its so beautiful

She’s open-mouthed with wonder Emma has to say something
nice too

EMMA
You certainly spared no expense

She smiles at Harriet who is smiling at the portrait as the
tinny tune winds down Mr Elton is smiling at Emma

EXT HARTFIELD - A FEW DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS - AFTERNOON 44

A carriage turns into the Hartfield drive We hear but do
not see the absolute bedlam within children crying
everyone speaking over everyone else-

ISABELLA (0S) JOHN KNIGHTLEY (0S)
Sit down Henry do not pull Oh for pity’s- now there’s
on your collar- stop that- milk all over my trousers
stop John discipline him Look Look what he did to my
Use your influence please trousers You know that’s
Do not make that face- going to leave a stain-
INT HARTFIELD UPPER CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS - AFTERNOON 45

Mr Woodhouse had been sitting in the window waiting He sees
the carriage approach and goes to tell Emma-

MR WOODHOUSE
Emma They are here

He hurries off but we stay in the window and watch down
through the glass as the carriage comes to a halt and the
butler approaches to open the door The chaos has been
silenced the family is now perfectly composed

Emma’s sister ISABELLA KNIGHTLEY late 20s like her father a
fellow hypochondriac is helped out first She is carrying a
baby in a swaddling-cloth After her comes JOHN KNIGHTLEY
early 30s a lawyer rather bad-tempered and judgmental
sponging his trousers and finally their children HENRY
JOHN and BELLA By this time the front door has opened and
Emma and Mr Woodhouse have come out to greet them We hear
their exclamations only mutedly through the glass

OMITTED

INT HARTFIELD GOLD DRAWING ROOM - AFTERNOON 47

Mr Knightley has now joined the family party Emma has the
baby in her arms and is walking it back and forth rocking it
to sleep

MR WOODHOUSE
(to Isabella)
I shall always be very sorry that
you went to the sea this autumn
instead of coming here

ISABELLA
But why should you be sorry sir
It did us a great deal of good

Emma is trying to catch Mr Knightley’s eye but he seems to
be avoiding her eye

MR WOODHOUSE
No I think Mr John Knightley is
far from looking well

MR JOHN KNIGHTLEY
South End was most strenuously
recommended by our physician sir

ISABELLA
Sea air and sea bathing

MR WOODHOUSE
(to Mr Knightley)
The sea is very rarely of use to
anybody I am sure it almost killed
me once

The inane conversation is too much for Emma who bursts out-

EMMA
Come I must beg you not to talk of
the sea It makes me envious and
miserable- I who have never seen
it South End is prohibited if you
please

She glances at Mr Knightley But he doesn’t smile

MR WOODHOUSE
In London it is always a sickly
season Nobody is healthy in
London Nobody can be

39A

Isabella starts telling her father about Mr Wingfield her
physician whose medical opinions Mr Woodhouse then contrasts
with the superior opinions of his Mr Perry

But we cross to Mr Knightley who takes pity on Emma and
comes over to her

MR KNIGHTLEY
Let us be friends

He reaches down and caresses the baby’s face

MR KNIGHTLEY (CONT’D)
(to the baby)
Tell your aunt little Emma that
she was very wrong and that she
ought to set you a better example

Suddenly the baby sicks up milk copiously Emma
involuntarily jerks the baby away from her body so that milk
doesn’t get on her dress alerting Isabella who flies to
rescue the baby-

ISABELLA
What is the matter Is there fever
Oh Where is the nurse- give her to
me-

MR WOODHOUSE
(panicked too)
Is he feverish Isabella

Emma and Mr Knightley are laughing Emma feels heartened by
the restored connection between them and belatedly answers
his scolding remark to the baby

EMMA
As far as good intentions went we
were both in the right I must say
I have not yet been proved wrong

Isabella and Mr Woodhouse are still in a flap

ISABELLA
(returning to him)
Oh I do not know I do not know I
do not know Where is the nurse

MR WOODHOUSE
(to Bartholomew)
Send for Perry

MR JOHN KNIGHTLEY
Do not send for Perry

ISABELLA
(chastising)
My love
(to Bartholomew)
Send for Perry
Mr Knightley turns to go But Emma wants to detain him
EMMA
Mr Knightley
(beat- he turns back)
Was Mr Martin very disappointed
Another beat Then very grave-

MR KNIGHTLEY
A man cannot be more so

He looks hard at her and then leaves her to her conscience

Emma opulently dressed in a fur-trimmed winter cape sweeps
up the walk to Mrs Goddard’s school The schoolgirls see her
and race ahead

INT MRS GODDARDS SCHOOL STAIRWELL - DAY 49

Emma has entered the hallway and has been met by Mrs
Goddard

EMMA
I have come to visit Miss Smith

MRS GODDARD
We were not expecting you

The schoolgirls watch star struck as Emma glides up the
stairs accompanied by Mrs Goddard

INT MRS GODDARDS SCHOOL HARRIET’S ROOM - DAY 50

When Emma comes in Harriet leaps up mortified that Emma has
seen where she lives But she’s too weak and almost faints

EMMA
Harriet

HARRIET
Miss Woodhouse

EMMA
You are so disheveled

HARRIET
I am always ill at Christmas

EMMA
Get back in bed at once

Harriet falls back in bed Emma sits beside her

EMMA (CONTD)
You will miss the party at
Randalls Mr Elton will be there
And Frank Churchill is expected at
last

HARRIET
(weakly)
And Mr Elton’s sermon

She pulls a pocketbook from under her pillow

HARRIET (CONTD)
The sermon on Christmas Day I
transcribe them every Sunday

EMMA
(taking the pocketbook)
I will transcribe it for you

HARRIET
You are so good to me Miss
Woodhouse I do not deserve it

Three carriages turn into the Randalls driveway Mr Weston
beaming comes out of the house to greet them

MR WESTON
Welcome welcome welcome

INT RANDALLS DRAWING ROOM - EVENING 53

A noisy scene of reunions everyone talking at once

ISABELLA
(to Mrs Weston)
“Mrs Weston” is very well for every
body else but to me you shall
always be my dear Miss Taylor

MRS WESTON
(to Isabella smiling)
And you my dear Miss Woodhouse
How are the children

JOHN KNIGHTLEY
(acidly answering for
Isabella)
Multiplying

ISABELLA
(to Mrs Weston)
They are not at all well I am
sorry to say Really we should
never have travelled at such a time
of year- Mr Wingfield expressly
said-

Meanwhile Mr Knightley is talking to Mr Woodhouse

MR KNIGHTLEY
How is your temperature sir Shall
I ask to bank the fire

But Mr Woodhouse has been distracted by the conversation
between Isabella and Mrs Weston He addresses Isabella

MR WOODHOUSE
We wanted you to visit in the
autumn Isabella
(to Mrs Weston)
They went to South End

Isabella and Mrs Weston peel off with Mr Woodhouse Mr Weston
comes to greet Emma

MR WESTON
How is poor Miss Smith

EMMA
No better I’m afraid
42a

She’s addressing Mr Elton who had been the first to take off
his coat and is poking about examining the trinkets on the
mantelpiece and patently passing judgement on the room

MR WESTON
Such a sad loss to our party today
(beat)
Miss Smith has sent her apologies

MR ELTON
She will be missed every moment

But in the next moment he forgets her altogether a servant
appears with a tray of glasses of wine He takes a glass

Meanwhile Mr John Knightley is complaining to Mr Knightley

MR JOHN KNIGHTLEY
Going in dismal weather to return
probably in worse- four horses and
four servants taken out for nothing
but to convey five idle shivering
creatures into colder rooms and
worse company than they might have
had at home

Mr Elton’s lack of concern for Harriet bothers Emma but
before she can press him Mr Weston has taken her arm

MR WESTON
Frank has been detained at
Enscombe I am sorry to say I had
a letter from him just this morning-

Mr Elton is left with the Knightley brothers

MR ELTON
I dare say we shall have some snow
(beat)
I was once snowed up at a friend’s
house for a week Nothing could be
pleasanter

MR JOHN KNIGHTLEY
I cannot wish to be snowed up a
week in Highbury

MR ELTON
(misunderstanding him)
Of course we are but a small
party You are perhaps used to the
large parties of London-

MR JOHN KNIGHTLEY
I know nothing of the large parties
of London sir I never dine with
anybody

Mr Elton is silenced Mr Knightley is trying not to smile He

looks over and sees Mr Weston giving Emma a letter evidently
from Frank

INT RANDALLS DINING ROOM - LATER - EVENING 54

The others are talking in small groups in the drawing room

Emma is sitting alone in the dining room which has already

been set for dinner She is re-reading the letter from Frank
Churchill Mr Knightley comes near

MR KNIGHTLEY
Another fine flourishing letter
full of professions and falsehoods

EMMA
Your feelings are singular His
letters seem to satisfy every body
else

MR KNIGHTLEY
I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs
Weston

This is quite true and Emma does not reply After a beat

MR KNIGHTLEY (CONTD)
Were she a person of consequence
herself he would have come by now
I dare say

EMMA
You seem determined to think ill of
him

MR KNIGHTLEY
I should be as ready to acknowledge
his merits as any other man

(MORE )

44

MR KNIGHTLEY (CONTD)
but I hear of none except that he
is well grown and good-looking

EMMA

(teasing)
Well if he has nothing else to
recommend him he will be a
treasure at Highbury We do not
often look upon fine young men we
cannot ask for all the virtues into
the bargain

MR KNIGHTLEY
You will excuse my being so much
overpowered

EMMA
We are both prejudiced you
against I for him and we will
have no chance of agreeing until he
is really here

MR KNIGHTLEY
Prejudiced I am not prejudiced

EMMA
But I am very much and without
being at all ashamed of it My love
for Mr and Mrs Weston gives me a
decided prejudice in his favour

She turns back to the letter Mr Knightley watches her for a
beat his expression clouded before bowing and moving away

Mr Elton sees Emma alone and sees an opportunity to go and

sit with her But just as he’s making his move the maid
steps between them and strikes a gong dinner is ready

INT RANDALLS DINING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER - EVENING 55

Mr Weston is seated at the head of the table Mr Woodhouse is
at the foot Mr Elton is next to Emma and trying in vain to
start a conversation with her but she is paying all her
attention to Mr and Mrs Weston who are talking about Frank

MR WESTON
Mrs Churchill is an odd woman She
was nobody when Mr Churchill
married her barely the daughter of
a gentleman but ever since being
turned into a Churchill she has out-
Churchill’d them all in high and
mighty claims

(MORE)

MR WESTON (CONTD)
She has decreed that if Frank does
not marry a lady of some fortune
he will be entirely cut out from
her will

MRS WESTON
There is jealousy She is jealous
even of his regard for his father

Mr Elton is trying to cut in

MR ELTON
Jealousy-

But Emma is focused on the Westons

EMMA
But she is so very fond of her
nephew He is her particular
favourite

MRS WESTON
Dear Emma do not attempt with
your good nature to understand a
bad one you must let it go its own
way

MR WESTON
Mrs Churchill rules at Enscombe
Everything gives way to her

MR ELTON
(raising his voice)
I have heard it described as one of
the finest houses in Yorkshire

They all look at him Embarrassed to have repeated himself
he fumbles for another topic of conversation-

MR ELTON (CONTD)
What seasonable weather we are
having I dare say we shall have
snow tonight

At word ‘snow’ everyone stops and looks at Mr Woodhouse He
stands up

MR WOODHOUSE
Snow Tonight

He looks at the window yes it’s snowing

Suddenly everyone is talking at once

ISABELLA MR KNIGHTLEY
But when did it commence We I will speak to James

He runs out Isabella has gone to the window Mr Woodhouse
has too

MR WESTON MRS WESTON

It was snowing when your get you home-

mother died

MR WOODHOUSE
(to Emma despairing)
What is to be done Emma What is
to be done

EMMA
(coming to him)
Mrs Weston is right papa You will
be quite safe The horses are in
excellent health and no one drives
as James does- you are surrounded
by friends-

MR WESTON
(trying again)
But there is room for all of you
For all of us The house is warm-
we have good wine- and hot food-

ISABELLA
My children My children are at
home- I cannot leave my children-

JOHN KNIGHTLEY
(snidely to Mr Woodhouse)
I admire your resolution sir in
venturing out in such weather
Anyone could have seen that snow
was coming on

ISABELLA
(snapping)
Do not vex my father sir

Mr Knightley comes back in his shoulders dusted with snow

46a

MR KNIGHTLEY
It has hardly begun Barely an
inch But it is falling fast We
must go at once

Mrs Weston gets up to instruct Hannah to get their coats Mr
Knightley follows her

MR WESTON
(vainly)
Mrs Weston- the party

MR WOODHOUSE
Where is the carriage Where is
James I must speak with James

Isabella is bundling Mr Woodhouse out the door John
Knightley can’t resist

JOHN KNIGHTLEY
And of course we have more than one
carriage so if one is blown over
in the wind-

ISABELLA
(appalled)
Husband please

They go out Only Mr Weston Mr Elton and Emma remain Mr
Elton is mortified for having caused such chaos so quickly

MR WESTON
(to Emma)
I think we shall be very glad Frank
did not come at Christmas The
spring will be a better time of
year better weather We shall be
very glad of the delay

He’s trying to say sorry She smiles at him kindly

56 EXT RANDALLS - NIGHT 56

It’s now snowing very hard Three carriages are waiting the
drivers wrapped up in hats and scarves stamping their feet
to keep warm The horses breathe plumes of steam

The door opens and Isabella and Mr Woodhouse exit-
MR WOODHOUSE

You will catch your death Your
husband is not strong
46B

ISABELLA
Look to your vinaigrette papa Mr
Knightley You must move your
carriage- my father is unwell-

MR KNIGHTLEY
Take it It is first and will be
fastest Come

He goes to his carriage which is first and opens the door
for Isabella and Mr Woodhouse She bundles Mr Woodhouse in
and Mr Knightley signals to the coachman to drive off

John Knightley is now exiting Mr Knightley hails him

MR KNIGHTLEY (CONTD)
I’1l ride with you then

And he and Mr Knightley climb into the second carriage
hurrying to escape the cold The door slams shut the second
carriage moves off and Emma who is just now exiting the
house is appalled to see that she is now obliged to travel
alone in a carriage with Mr Elton

EMMA
Oh

She looks in despair at the departing carriages Mr Elton is
by the open door of the third carriage offering his hand-

MR ELTON
Miss Woodhouse

INT WOODHOUSE CARRIAGE - NIGHT 57

Emma is resolutely quiet looking out the window and trying
to pretend Mr Elton doesn’t exist Mr Elton sitting
opposite is staring at her amorously A beat then he leaps
across the carriage to sit next to her and seizes her hand
She wrenches it away at once horrified

EMMA
Mr Elton

MR ELTON
I must avail myself of this
precious opportunity to declare
sentiments which must be already
well known-

EMMA
Mr Elton please You have drunk
too much wine

MR ELTON
My ardent attachment-

EMMA
Mr Elton

She detaches herself and goes to sit where he was sitting

EMMA (CONTD)
You forget yourself

MR ELTON
I am ready to die if you refuse me

EMMA
You take me for my friend Any
message to Miss Smith I shall be
happy to deliver

MR ELTON
Miss Smith Message to Miss Smith

EMMA
Command yourself to say no more
and I will endeavour to forget it

MR ELTON
I never thought of Miss Smith in
the whole course of my existence-
never paid her any attentions but
as your friend never cared whether
she were dead or alive but as your
friend Oh Miss Woodhouse Who can
think of Miss Smith when Miss
Woodhouse is near Everything I
have said or done for many weeks
has been with the sole view of
making my adoration to yourself

EMMA
Oh good heaven

Now she doesn’t know whether to laugh or cry A beat then-

MR ELTON
Charming Miss Woodhouse Allow me
to interpret this interesting
silence It confesses that you have
long understood me

EMMA
No sir it confesses no such
thing Nothing could be farther
from my wishes Your pursuit of
Harriet gave me great pleasure and
I have been very earnestly wishing
you success

MR ELTON
(irritated)
Miss Smith is a very good sort of
girl
(MORE )

MR ELTON (CONTD)

and no doubt there are men who
might not object to-

(beat)
Everybody has their level

(petulantly now)
Madam my visits to Hartfield have
been for yourself only and the
encouragement I received—

EMMA
Encouragement I give you
encouragement Sir you have been
entirely mistaken I have no
thoughts of matrimony at present
A beat Mr Elton looks like he’s about to explode Suddenly

MR ELTON
Stop the carriage Driver- stop

The carriage stops He wrenches open the door and gets out

EMMA
Mr Elton-

The door slams He’s gone A beat Emma still processing

INT MRS GODDARD’S SCHOOL PARLOUR - CHRISTMAS DAY - DAY 58

Harriet still looking very ill is crowded around a small
table with a group of girls They have formed a pile of flour
on a large plate at the top of which they have placed a
bullet and the girls are passing a knife around cutting
away slices of the flour and trying not to disturb the
bullet They’re all giggling and breathless

Finally it’s Harriet’s turn She makes the cut- and the
bullet drops into the flour All the girls start screaming
with pleasure Harriet puts down the knife and puts her face
into the pile of flour to retrieve the bullet with her mouth

But when she comes up the bullet in her teeth flour all
over her face the girls aren’t laughing They are looking
open-mouthed with horror over Harriet’s shoulder Blinking
Harriet turns to see what has transfixed them- and sees Emma
in the doorway elegantly dressed but looking ashen-faced

INT MRS GODDARDS SCHOOL HARRIET’S ROOM - DAY 59

There’s still a dusty halo of flour around Harriet’s face

How kind of you to visit me on (firmly)
Christmas Day Miss Woodhouse I Harriet
have been longing to hear about the
party at Randalls Cottage And did Harriet stops and dissolves into tears
you hear that Mr Elton has gone
away He left town quite HARRIET
unexpectedly- nobody knows why I cannot see it without thinking of

him
Emma looks at the picture of Harriet in its ridiculous frame
EMMA

EMMA Burn the frame if you like but you
Presumptuous conceited man must keep the likeness

HARRIET An uncomfortable silence Then-

Miss Woodhouse
EMMA (CONTD)
EMMA Then I will take it

How could I have been so deceived (beat)
I will take it

A beat Harriet reading her Then realising

HARRIET 60 EXT HARTFIELD - A FEW DAYS LATER - DAY 60
He never loved me He loved you

Isabella John Knightley and the children have said their

Harriet has started to cry Her tears streak through the goodbyes to Emma and Mr Woodhouse and are now piling into
flour the carriage to return to London Isabella is fussing over
the children as usual as she climbs aboard to join them
EMMA

Love He sought to aggrandize and Be still and eat this Henry sit
enrich himself He had the next to your sister Why are you so
arrogance to raise his eyes to me pale And where is the baby Bella
a Woodhouse and so convinced stop Henry
himself in love He is a vicar
(noticing Harriet’s tears John Knightley is the last to climb aboard Before he leaves
for the first time) he looks straight at Emma with loathing A beat then-
Harriet You might never have
thought of him but for me I JOHN KNIGHTLEY
assured you of his attachment- I How I hate the childless

contrived his visits to Hartfield-
He climbs into the carriage and the coachman shuts the door

HARRIET
Dear Miss Woodhouse I do not blame EMMA
you I could never have deserved Goodbye Isabella Goodbye little
him and none but so partial and ones Goodbye
kind a friend as you could have
even thought it possible The carriage begins to move Emma returns to her father who

is by the door and to her surprise sees he is crying
Emma doesn’t know what to say Harriet looks at the picture
A beat then she runs across the room towards the it EMMA (CONT’D)
intending to take it and throw it into the fire Papa
Sia

MR WOODHOUSE
(thickly)
I wish she would not leave

He fishes for a handkerchief and waves it as the carriage
goes down the drive Emma takes his arm and hugs him to her

MR WOODHOUSE (CONTD)
You must never leave me Emma

EMMA
Oh papa You know I never will

Emma puts her head on his shoulder and they watch as the
carriage turns into the lane and disappears from sight

EXT HIGHBURY LANE - A FEW WEEKS LATER - DAY 61

Emma and Harriet are walking to the village beside the river
Harriet is going on about Mr Elton to Emma’s annoyance She
has her book of sermons out

HARRIET
He cannot stay away forever The
curate cannot give the sermon
forever No one preaches as Mr
Elton does Hear this extract Miss
Woodhouse- hear this-

EMMA
(rounding on her)
Enough about Mr Elton

Impulsively Harriet throws the book into the water

Emma is aghast Harriet immediately regrets her choice A
beat They stare at each other horrified

MISS BATES (0S)
Miss Woodhouse Miss Smith

Miss Bates is running towards them waving a handkerchief
excitedly Emma is almost relieved to see her

MISS BATES (CONTD)
My niece- Jane Fairfax- Miss
Woodhouse- Jane Fairfax- she has-
Jane has surprised us She is here

INT MRS BATES’ ROOMS - TEN MINUTES LATER - DAY 62

The Bates’ first-floor rooms are very humble this is a
household only just scraping by

Mrs Bates is by the fire Opposite sits JANE FAIRFAX early
20s a very composed reserved young woman beautiful but

very pale and quite without animation Emma and Harriet are
now seated with cups of tea Miss Bates is prattling away
MISS BATES
She caught a bad cold poor thing
so long ago as the 7th of November

52A

MISS BATES (CONTD)
she has never been well since and
her kind friends the Campbells
thought she had better come home

(MORE ) and try an air that always agrees
with her they have no doubt that
three or four months at Highbury
will entirely cure her

In her excitement Miss Bates is rattling her teacup against
the saucer as she speaks The sound is maddening to Emma but
it doesn’t seem to be affecting Jane at all her composure is
absolute

Harriet is sitting forlornly apart a little tearful still
mourning the loss of her sermons

JANE FAIRFAX
(to Emma blandly)
I hope that your father is well

EMMA
Very well I thank you

MISS BATES
Jane has been ill since the 7th of
November A long time is it not
for a cold to hang upon her My
mother and I have been so
distressed But she is here now
She is here at last Nobody could
nurse as we should do We shall
feed her baked apples extremely
wholesome and apple dumplings

JANE FAIRFAX
I am very grateful to you aunt
for your concern

Her bland composure infuriates Emma

MISS BATES
She is very sorry to be parted from
her dear friends the Campbells and
Mrs Dixon and Mr Dixon who is a
most amiable young man and did her
so great a service at Weymouth in
October I shudder to envision what
might have- if not for Mr Dixon-
and the boat and the water- such a
charming man Is not this
pleasantHow glad we are that Jane
is here She plans to stay three
months
EMMA
We must have you all to Hartfield
MISS BATES
Oh Mother Do you hear
(shouting)
(MORE )

53A

MISS BATES (CONTD)

Miss Woodhouse has invited us to
Hartfield

(to Harriet happily)
My mother’s deafness is very
trifling you see By only raising
my voice and saying a thing two or
three times over she is sure to
hear But it is very remarkable
that she should always hear Jane
better than she does me

INT HARTFIELD GREAT HALL - A FEW DAYS LATER - AFTERNOON 63

Emma is preparing lavish floral arrangements to place
throughout the house for the Bates’ visit She’s possibly
overdoing it a little She places them gauging their effect

INT HARTFIELD DINING ROOM - NIGHT 64

Emma Mr Woodhouse Mrs Bates Miss Bates Harriet Mrs
Goddard Jane Fairfax Mr and Mrs Weston and Mr Knightley are
at dinner waited on by the male servants of Hartfield

Mr Woodhouse at the head of the table is between Mrs
Goddard and Mrs Bates He is policing what they eat-

MR WOODHOUSE
I do not advise the custard
Perhaps a little bit of tart A
very little bit And what do you
say to a half glass of wine A
small half glass In a tumbler of
water

MISS BATES
(to her mother shouting)
MOTHER YOU MUST SAMPLE THE TART

Everyone jumps a mile Mrs Bates most of all

Everyone resumes their conversations Mr Woodhouse with Mrs
Bates Mr Knightley with Mr and Mrs Weston in the middle of
the table where Mr Weston is as ever apologising for Frank-

MR WESTON
We shall be seeing Frank any day
now I have no doubt of it-

Emma is at the foot of the table between Harriet and Jane
Fairfax She turns to Jane but before she gets a word in
54A

Miss Bates launches in having caught the subject of Mr
Weston’s conversation and picked up on it-

MISS BATES
Now Mr Frank Churchill is a man
much talked about in Highbury is
he not Miss Woodhouse We are all
so very eager to meet him He was
at Weymouth when Jane was there

Jane startles imperceptibly and tries to downplay it

JANE FAIRFAX
We are very little acquainted

HARRIET
(to Emma in a whisper)
That was the month of his father’s
wedding

She glances at Mr and Mrs Weston But they are deep in
conversation with Mr Knightley and don’t look up at Frank’s
name

EMMA
(still to Jane)
But you must describe him Is he
handsome Is he agreeable

JANE FAIRFAX
I believe he is generally
thought so
(changing the subject)
How well-prepared these ices are I
must ask your cook for the method

Miss Bates leans forward-

MISS BATES
My dear Miss Woodhouse- such a
lavish meal- you are too bountiful
We are so honoured by the kind
attentions of our dearest friends

Emma is still looking at Jane who is still studiously
avoiding her gaze

INT HARTFIELD MINT DRAWING ROOM - LATER - NIGHT 65

Emma is seated at the piano playing for the guests who are
seated in concert format around her Harriet stands at her
shoulder to turn the pages Her playing is competent but it
lacks brilliance She finishes the piece and everyone
applauds She stands up gesturing to Jane to take her place

EMMA
Miss Fairfax What a pity you
didn’t bring your music

Jane stands up too
JANE FAIRFAX
I hope that I can recollect the
tune

Emma yields the piano to Jane and goes to sits down next to
Harriet who leans over and whispers loyally-
55A

HARRIET
Nobody in the world plays like you
do

Jane Fairfax begins to play It’s immediately apparent that
she is leagues ahead of Emma in terms of technical skill and
poetic feeling

Annoyed Emma looks over and sees Mr Knightley gazing at Jane
with frank appreciation

Mr Woodhouse is sitting next to Miss Bates who is fanning
herself energetically with a fan The draught is maddening to
him She doesn’t notice she’s captivated by Jane

EMMA
(to Harriet whispering)
She is so cold so cautious There
is no getting at her real opinion
She is wrapped up in a cloak of
politeness determined to hazard
nothing at all

Mr Knightley gets up and comes over to Emma

MR KNIGHTLEY
I am glad you invited Miss Fairfax
to play having no instrument at
her grandmother’s it must be a
real indulgence

EMMA
I am glad you approve but I hope I
am not often deficient in what is
due to my guests at Hartfield

MR KNIGHTLEY
No you are not often deficient
(beat)
You make it very plain you do not
like Miss Fairfax

EMMA
Everybody supposes we must be so
fond of each other because our
ages are the same Ever since I can
remember I have been told that I
could have no better companion than
Jane Fairfax She who is so
accomplished and so superior

MR KNIGHTLEY
She is certainly accomplished
perhaps the accomplished young
woman you wish to be thought
yourself

Jane finishes the piece she’s playing and everyone but Emma
applauds Mr Knightley looks at Emma Sulkily Emma switches
on a smile and applauds half-heartedly

The door opens and the Martin sisters come in followed by
Robert Martin They’re all very wet Harriet and Robert both
startle red-faced But there’s nowhere to hide

HARRIET (CONTD)
(to Emma in a whisper)
I must go

But it’s too late

ELIZABETH MARTIN
Harriet We have missed you
(with a glance at Robert)
My mother has been asking for you
(MORE )

ELIZABETH MARTIN (CONTD)
Will you come and visit us again

Harriet glances at Emma stricken not knowing what to do
But she can’t decline the invitation She nods

Of course Good day Miss Martin

Curtseying awkwardly to Robert Martin she goes out

EXT FORDS HABERDASHER - DAY 69

She is walking away through the rain when-

ROBERT MARTIN (OS)
Miss Smith

Harriet turns He has followed her out into the rain even in
a few seconds they have both become drenched A beat all the
more romantic for the rain Then-

ROBERT MARTIN (CONT’D)
The near way is flooded You would
do better going round by Mr Cole’s
stables The ground is higher
there

EXT ABBEY MILL LANE - A FEW DAYS LATER - DAY 71

Emma’s carriage makes its way down the lane towards the Abbey
Mill Farm and comes to a halt Emma is talking her into it

EMMA
You behaved extremely well and it
is over As a first meeting it
cannot occur again

Harriet is nodding talking herself into it

EMMA (CONTD)
You must stay no more than a
quarter of an hour and allow no
dangerous reminiscences There must
be no recurrence into the past

Harriet nods steeling herself James opens the door and
helps Harriet out not noticing that she drops the muff she
has been clutching in her lap The women don’t notice it
either Harriet goes apprehensively down the path to the
cottage trying to be brave and James returns to the
drivers seat to wait

Emma watches from the carriage as Mrs Martin Elizabeth
Martin and her sister greet Harriet warmly smiling hugging
hugging her inviting her in

A HORSEMAN appears coming from the opposite direction He
reins in when he sees the carriage hailing James

INT EMMA’S CARRIAGE - DAY 72

Right outside the carriage window is the horseman’s foot and
knee Emma cranes to see the rider and perceives a handsome
man dashingly coiffed and wearing very tight trousers (It

is FRANK CHURCHILL but Emma doesn’t know this yet)

FRANK CHURCHILL
I seek the village of Highbury
sir Is it near

JAMES
Very near sir But three miles
Over the bridge then left at the
Crown and you’ll see the steeple

FRANK CHURCHILL
Thank you I’m very much obliged

He tosses a coin to James roguishly then turns and looks
directly at Emma The move is flirty and very practised he
was aware of her the whole time but he has saved his first
look in order to dazzle her Then he sees Harriet’s muff in
the dirt He dismounts picks it up then opens the carriage
door and presents it to Emma like a prince in a fairy tale

As he puts the foot up on the carriage step the whole
carriage leans towards him almost tipping her into his lap

A little stunned she takes the muff He winks tips his hat

then shuts the door mounts his horse kicks it into a
canter and tears off

INT HARTFIELD HOTHOUSE - THE NEXT MORNING - DAY 73

Emma is among the flowers selecting blooms humming happily
to herself when she sees through the misted windows of the
hothouse the man she encountered the previous day

He shimmers through the misted glass almost as if he has
been conjured by Emma’s imagination He sees Emma and smiles

Then Mr and Mrs Weston appear behind him and Emma realises
who he is

INT HARTFIELD HOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY 74

They’ve come in Mr Weston presents Frank to Emma proudly

MR WESTON
My son Mr Frank Churchill Miss
Emma Woodhouse

Frank bows eyes twinkling and Emma curtseys

MR WESTON (CONT’D)
He has caught us quite by surprise

EMMA
He has indeed

The fact they met yesterday is already like a private joke
between them

FRANK CHURCHILL
There are not many houses I should
presume on so far sir but in
coming home I felt that I might
take the liberty

Mr Weston is looking at Emma eagerly anxiously he wants the
two of them to fall in love as soon as possible To that end-

MR WESTON

We have made a plan to walk to the
village Emma Will you join us

EXT HIGHBURY BRIDGE - LATER - DAY 75

Mr and Mrs Weston are walking a discreet distance ahead
leaving Emma and Frank Churchill to walk together

EMMA
Do you plan to stay in Highbury
long

FRANK CHURCHILL
But two weeks alas My aunt cannot
spare me any longer

EMMA
You must know your arrival has been
long anticipated

Across the street Mrs Goddard is walking her crocodile of
girls who are completely star-struck at the sight of Frank
Churchill in his tight trousers

FRANK CHURCHILL
I have always had the greatest
curiosity to visit Now that I am
here I find it lovelier than ever
I imagined

He holds his arms out to embrace the scene turning about
speaking deliberately loudly enough for the girls to hear-

FRANK CHURCHILL (CONTD)
Oh airy cheerful happy-seeming
Highbury

The girls dissolve in giggles Mrs Goddard shoos them on

EMMA
I believe we have a mutual
acquaintance in Jane Fairfax Did
you meet often at Weymouth

Up ahead is Ford’s He runs to it

FRANK CHURCHILL
Oh- pray let us go in here that I
may prove myself to be a true
citizen of Highbury I must buy
something at Fords

He makes for the door But Emma doesn’t move He perceives
her hesitation and returns to her

FRANK CHURCHILL (CONTD)
But I beg your pardon Miss
Woodhouse- you were speaking to me

EMMA
I merely asked whether you had
known much of Miss Fairfax and her
party at Weymouth

FRANK CHURCHILL
And now that I understand the
question I must pronounce it to be
a very unfair one It is always the
lady’s right to decide on the
degree of acquaintance

EMMA
Upon my word You answer as
discreetly as she would herself
But her account leaves so much to
be guessed that I really think you
May say what you like of your
acquaintance with her

FRANK CHURCHILL
May I indeed Shall we go in

He gestures toward the door again They go into the shop

INT FORDS HABERDASHER - DAY 76

Emma and Frank inspect the gloves laid out on the counter for

a moment Then very casually

FRANK CHURCHILL
You are her intimate friend

EMMA
Intimacy between Miss Fairfax and
me is quite out of the question I
have no reason to think ill of her-
not the least- but I never could
attach myself to any one so
completely reserved

FRANK CHURCHILL
It is a most repulsive quality
indeed There is safety in reserve
but no attraction One cannot love
a reserved person Nor a person so
continually out of health

EMMA
(feeling guilty)
Her constitution is delicate

FRANK CHURCHILL

To me nothing can make amends for
the want of a fine glow of health
Where features are indifferent a
fine complexion gives beauty to
them all and where they are good
the effect is-

(bowing to Emma)
-well fortunately I need not
attempt to describe what the effect
is

Emma doesn’t quite know what to say She’s flattered but
feels guilty too

Frank has seen Jane Fairfax through the window She is with
Miss Bates and they have just intercepted the Westons and
are talking in the street

FRANK CHURCHILL (CONTD)
Oh good heaven There she is
(with mock horror)
My father will oblige me to talk to
her Ugh I feel fatigued already

He’s too wicked Emma still a little bewildered smothers a
giggle

Outside Mr Weston is gesturing to Ford’s and evidently
telling Jane and Miss Bates that Frank has arrived Miss
Bates is ecstatic But Jane meets Frank’s eye through the
glass then takes her aunt’s arm reminding her of a prior
engagement They farewell the Westons and move away

EXT HIGHBURY MARKET SQUARE - LATER - DAY 77

Emma and Frank Churchill have resumed their walk They pass
the Crown Inn Stacks of chairs have been piled outside
ready for a cart to come and clear them away Frank gestures
to it

FRANK CHURCHILL
Here is where you have your balls
I suppose Every fortnight through
the winter

EMMA
(laughing)
I am afraid Highbury may yet
disappoint you Mr Churchill We
have not society enough for
dancing
FRANK CHURCHILL
Oh but an inn of this size must
have a ball-room and where there
is a ball-room there can be a
ball We cannot do without dancing

He grabs her hand grinning and leads her in a dance through

the forest of chairs

FRANK CHURCHILL (CONTD)
(as he dances)

Instances have been known of young
people passing many many months
successively without being at any
ball of any description and no
material injury either to body or
to mind but when a beginning is
made-

Mr and Mrs Weston have joined them He’s addressing them all

showing off a little enjoying his own flamboyance

FRANK CHURCHILL (CONTD)
-when the felicities of motion have
once been felt- it must be a very
heavy heart that does not ask for
more

Mr Weston infected by Frank’s energy takes Mrs Weston by
the hand and leads her in a few steps She’s laughing

MRS WESTON
It is very dirty

MR WESTON
My dear you are too particular By
candle-light it will be as clean as
Randalls We must have a ball

FRANK CHURCHILL
And when we do-
(bowing to Emma)
May I hope for the honour of your
hand for the first two dances

Emma is delighted She curtseys
Mr Weston doesn’t want the moment to end Eagerly

MR WESTON
(eagerly)
The Coles are to host a supper-
party in Frank’s honour Perhaps
there will be dancing there

He HH OF FH FH HH HH HK

But Mrs Weston looking uncomfortable stops him

MRS WESTON

Mr Weston

(delicately)
The Coles are good people but
their origins are low It is not
for merchants to set the terms on
which the superior families visit
them

MR WESTON
But Frank is in Highbury only two
weeks And we have all been
invited

MRS WESTON
(even more delicately)
Harriet Smith has not been invited
(to Frank)
Emma’s dear companion

A slightly awkward beat Emma glances at Frank battling with
hersel She knows she should be loyal to Harriet and she
feels real snobbery towards the Coles But she wants to go

At last

disappoint the Coles- such good

Knightley carriage He’s also well dressed

EMMA
Mr Knightley This is coming as you
should do like a gentleman

MR KNIGHTLEY
(amused)
You think me more of a gentleman
than usual

EMMA
Indeed I do You do not use your
carriage so often as becomes the
owner of Donwell Abbey Had you
arrived on foot I should not have
been so happy to walk in with you

They start ascending the stairs to the house

MR KNIGHTLEY
I am surprised you are happy to
walk in at all So Emma Woodhouse
deigned to accept an invitation
from the merchant Mr Cole

EMMA
Mr Churchill will soon return to
Yorkshire We must make the most of
every opportunity before he does

MR KNIGHTLEY
(sarcastic)
“We must”

EMMA
He is in Highbury only two weeks

MR KNIGHTLEY
And yet he spent a whole day going
to London just to get his hair cut
Sixteen miles twice over He is a
trifling silly fop

67A

They pass into the house

INT COLES’ RESIDENCE - NIGHT - LATER 84

Dinner is over and the guests are moving through into the
next room

Mr Knightley and Frank Churchill find themselves in each
other’s vicinity They are trying to avoid each other
feeling mutual dislike but Mr Cole appears between them

MR COLE
Such grand estates you have in
common gentlemen Donwell Abbey
and Enscombe-

At the mention of the word ‘Enscombe’ Jane throws Frank a
look He is flummoxed Mr Cole realises he has made a mistake-

MR COLE (CONT’D)
(to Frank)
Soon to inherit of course Soon to
inherit Enscombe
(realising he has made
another)
Not too soon I trust your uncle
Churchill is in good health

Neither Mr Knightley nor Frank Churchill wants to take up
this awkward attempt at small talk They bow stiffly to one
another then move away Mr Knightley towards Emma and Frank
towards Mr Weston Mr Cole also glad to be released from his
embarrassment moves off to speak to Jane

Mrs Cole meanwhile has taken Emma’s arm

MRS COLE
And have you heard the choicest
piece of gossip that has set all
the tongues of the village aflame

Emma suppresses a look of disdain at Mrs Cole’s crassness

MRS COLE (CONTD)
A pianoforte - very elegant-—
delivered to Miss Fairfax this very
morning with no return address

Emma glances around jealously realising that almost everyone
is talking about Jane

MRS COX
(to Mrs Weston)
I never saw so fine an instrument-

MISS GILBERT
(to Mrs Cox)
A pianoforte very elegant and
with no return address

MRS COX
(to Mrs Weston)
No return address

MRS COLE
(to Emma)
Jane herself is quite at a loss-
quite bewildered to think who could
have sent it

MRS COX
(still to Mrs Weston)
Bewildered indeed-

MR KNIGHTLEY
(to Mrs Cole)
Perhaps her friends the Campbells

In the background Mr Cole has led Jane to the piano and is
inviting her to leaf through the piano music

MRS COLE
One can suppose nothing else but
Jane had a letter from them very
lately-

MISS GILBERT
(clocking in)
Tuesday-

MRS COLE
-and not a word was said about it
68A 69

MRS COX EMMA
They are entirely confounded I suppose I smile for pleasure A
pianoforte is a handsome present
MISS GILBERT
Such a lavish gift FRANK CHURCHILL
Very
MRS COLE
Jane is so very accomplished EMMA
I rather wonder it was never made
MRS COXMISS GILBERTMRS COLE before
Indeed
Mr Knightley has left Miss Bates and Mrs Cole and joined Jane
MRS COX and Mr Cole at the piano Mr Cole suggests they sing a duet
I have never known facility like together and goes to dispatch a servant to fetch a violin for
hers Mr Knightley to play leaving Jane and Mr Knightley alone
Emma sees that Frank Churchill is having his glass refreshed FRANK CHURCHILL
by the Coles’ butler He is smiling Bored by the endless Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been
conversation about Jane she steps away from Miss Bates and staying here so long before
Mrs Cole and goes over to him smiling too
EMMA
EMMA Or that Colonel Campbell did not
Why do you smile give her the use of his own
instrument which must now be shut
FRANK CHURCHILL up in London untouched by anybody

Nay why do you
Frank glances at Jane who looks up and catches his eye Her
expression is not warm

FRANK CHURCHILL
(wickedly to Emma)
She has done her hair in so odd a
way I never saw anything like it
It must be a fancy of her own I
see nobody else looking like her

Emma smothers a laugh unkindly

Jane looks over at them hurt She hasn’t caught the
substance of their conversation but she knows from their
body language that they are being unkind

Frank who has used this spiteful jab to regain his
composure resumes

FRANK CHURCHILL (CONT’D)
If Colonel Campbell is not the
person who can be Mrs Dixon A
token of her friendship perhaps

But Emma has been encouraged by Frank’s unkindness to be
unkind herself She lowers her voice too-
69a

EMMA
What do you say to Mr Dixon

FRANK CHURCHILL
Mr Dixon

EMMA
He saved her life Did you ever
hear of it A water-party and by
some accident she was falling
overboard He caught her

84a

Frank Churchill hesitates He looks over at Jane who is the
very model of respectable politeness Then he nods

FRANK CHURCHILL
At first supposing that Colonel
Campbell was the giver I saw it
only as paternal kindness But now
I can see it in no other light than
as a secret offering of love

Emma smothers another laugh Mr Knightley glances at her

Mr Knightley receives the violin and tunes it ready to play
The others move closer Mr Cole addresses them all-

MR COLE
Ladies and gentlemen a duet

Jane and Mr Knightley begin to play a gorgeous duet
Mrs Weston comes over to speak to Emma

MRS WESTON
What do you say to this Emma I
have made a match between Mr
Knightley and Jane Fairfax

Emma has recoiled at the very thought

EMMA
Mr Knightley and Jane Fairfax

MRS WESTON

This pianoforte has been sent to
her by somebody- and she has always
been a favourite with him

(even more excitedly)
Tonight he sent his carriage for
her as a courtesy- and walked
himself Was that not gallant

Emma is taken aback So Mr Knightley didn’t arrive as a
gentleman after all Feeling foolish she watches him play
Frank next to her is also in a bad mood it’s unclear how
much of Mrs Weston’s gossip he has heard

Jane and Mr Knightley are now singing Everyone joins in

lustily for the chorus Emma and Frank are the only people
who aren’t having fun

EXT COLES’ RESIDENCE - NIGHT 840

The sound of their singing filters out into the night

87 EXT HARTFIELD - DAY 87

Emma intercepts Harriet just as she’s approaching the house
Her coat is already on and she’s tying on her bonnet

EMMA
Let us pay a call on Jane Fairfax

HARRIET
(bewildered)
Jane Fairfax Whatever for

Emma has already left Harriet hurries after her

88 INT MRS BATES’ ROOMS IN HIGHBURY - DAY 88

Emma and Harriet come into the tiny room to find Frank
Churchill fiddling with Mrs Bates’ spectacles while Jane
plays the piano It takes up an absurd amount of space in the
room She stops playing as they come in Frank jumps up

FRANK CHURCHILL
Miss Woodhouse Miss Smith You
find me trying to be useful Come
tell me if I shall succeed

He makes space for her to sit by him There isn’t much room
Emma has to squeeze around the piano to go to Frank which
flusters and irritates her

MISS BATES
The rivet on my mother’s spectacles
came out this morning and who
should leap to our assistance but
Mr Frank Churchill “Oh” said he “I
do think I can fasten the rivet I
like a job of this kind
excessively” Which you know showed
him to be so very- Miss Smith- he
far exceeds anything- everyone
should have two pairs of
spectacles They should indeed
Jane said so “Oh I can fasten the
rivet” said he

She goes on but we have crossed to Frank and Emma who are
seated next to one another

Jane with a glance at Emma has started playing again

FRANK CHURCHILL
(to Jane)
What a felicity to hear that tune
again If I mistake it not it was
danced at Weymouth With Mr Dixon

Jane falters She looks at Emma confused Emma is smothering
a smile She starts playing something else

EMMA
(in a whisper)
You speak too plain She must
understand you

FRANK CHURCHILL
(also in a whisper)
I hope she does

EMMA
Mine was a random guess Do not
distress her

FRANK CHURCHILL
If she is distressed it must be
for a reason She has something to
hide

MISS BATES
(to Harriet)
And Mr Knightley has honoured us
with a gift of apples Donwell
apples with his very special
compliments

INT HARTFIELD EMMA’S ROOM - NIGHT 89

Emma is in her nightgown She’s sitting in the window
reflective doubting herself She stares at the flame of the
candle on the sill then reaches out and snuffs out the
flame

EXT HARTFIELD SHRUBBERY - THE NEXT DAY - DAY 90

Emma is cutting roses in the garden The wind whips her dress
against the roses and she has to tug it free of the thorns

Frank Churchill comes up behind her Mr Weston is waiting at
a discreet distance giving them time to say goodbye

FRANK CHURCHILL
Of all horrid things leave-taking
is the worst

EMMA
But you will come again This will
not be your only visit to Highbury

FRANK CHURCHILL
I am at the mercy of my aunt in
that regard As I am in everything
(beat)
She and uncle are to spend the
season in Richmond however

He seems to be trying to tell her something and he doesn’t
know how The wind is aggravating him as is the fact that
Emma isn’t giving him her full attention

EMMA
Richmond But that is but nine
miles away You may visit every day
if you wish And we shall have our
ball

FRANK CHURCHILL
Our ball My father depends on it

Something’s wrong

FRANK CHURCHILL (CONTD)
Perhaps Miss Woodhouse- I think
you can hardly be without
suspicion—

73z

He’s about to go on but Mr Woodhouse appears at the window
MR WOODHOUSE
Emma The wind- you will catch your
death Come in at once I beg you

Mr Weston is waiting for Frank There isn’t time to say
anything more Frank bows to her

FRANK CHURCHILL
Goodbye

And he goes to join his father Emma stares after him
frowning slightly She’s not quite sure what just happened

INT HIGHBURY PARISH CHURCH - MORNING 91

Emma and Mr Woodhouse walk down the aisle to their usual pew
Harriet following behind them Halfway down the aisle Emma
sees to her astonishment that someone is sitting in her
place a woman very showily dressed She’s facing front

When they reach the front she sees them and turns MRS
ELTON is a social climber competitive modern brash self-
serving- and triumphantly married

Emma is dumbstruck and doesn’t know how to handle the
situation Harriet is bewildered Mrs Elton doesn’t get up
She looks at Emma coolly and then gives her a haughty smile

Emma and Mr Woodhouse are obliged to sit in the far pew As

they sit down Mr Woodhouse sees to his displeasure that Mrs
Elton has just found the folded blanket under their pew She
tucks it over her knees with satisfaction

At the altar Mr Elton begins to intone the day’s scripture

MR ELTON

Enter not into judgment with thy
servant O Lord for in thy sight
shall no man living be justified

(portentous beat)
Dearly beloved brethren the
Scripture moveth us in sundry
places to acknowledge and confess
our manifold sins and
wickednesses

(then with pride)
Wickednesses

INT HIGHBURY PARISH CHURCH - AN HOUR LATER - MORNING 92

The service has now concluded the parishioners are standing
Mr Elton proceeds down the aisle first and then both Emma
and Mrs Elton turn to follow him A tiny beat as there is a
battle of wills as to who will go first Then Mrs Elton
sweeps after Mr Elton taking his arm

Harriet and Emma disbelieving fall into step behind them

HARRIET
(distraught)
He is married

EMMA
It cannot be a long acquaintance
He has only been gone six weeks

Mr Woodhouse is following them out

At the door Mr and Mrs Elton station themselves at the door
in order to greet each member of the congregation as they
depart When Emma Harriet and Mr Woodhouse approach Mr
Elton presents Mrs Elton addressing Mr Woodhouse

MR ELTON
My wife Mrs Augusta Elton

MR WOODHOUSE
(to Mrs Elton)
I hate weddings People make you
eat their favourite food

MRS ELTON
(not listening)
We really seem quite the fashion
From Monday to Saturday I assure
you we have not a disengaged day
(turning to Emma and
gesturing to the
congregation)
What charming society Miss
Woodhouse for such a small and
sheltered village Mrs Weston
appears so truly good- there is
something so motherly and kind-
hearted about her
(lowering her voice)
She was your governess I think

Emma is too shocked to answer
MRS ELTON (CONTD)
I was rather astonished to find her

so very ladylike But she is really
quite the gentlewoman

INT HARTFIELD MINT DRAWING ROOM - A FEW DAYS LATER - DAY 93

Mr and Mrs Elton are seated on the sofa They both look
triumphant but in different ways Mr Elton is vengeful Mrs
Elton lofty Emma Harriet and Mr Woodhouse sit opposite
Harriet looks so miserable she might be sick Tea has been
served and the servants have withdrawn

MRS ELTON
This house is very like my brother
Mr Suckling’s seat at Maple Grove
Very like I am quite struck by the
likeness Is it not astonishingly
like dear husband

MR ELTON
Very like

MRS ELTON
I really could almost fancy myself
at Maple Grove The staircase- as I
came in I observed how very like
the staircase is placed exactly in
the same part of the house

MR ELTON
Very true my dear

MRS ELTON
I really could not help exclaiming
I assure you Miss Woodhouse it is
very delightful to me to be
reminded of a place I am so
extremely partial to as Maple
Grove

MR ELTON
A most impressive residence

MRS ELTON
Whenever you are transplanted like
me Miss Woodhouse you will
understand how very delightful it
is to meet with anything at all
that reminds one of what one has
left behind

Emma opens her mouth to reply but Mrs Elton goes on now
addressing Mr Woodhouse-

MRS ELTON (CONTD)
We have been calling at Randalls
What pleasant people the Westons
seem to be And who do you think
came in while we were there
Knightley Knightley himself

Emma is appalled at her presumption Even Mr Elton looks a
bit embarrassed But Mrs Elton goes on gaily

MRS ELTON (CONT’D)
Of course as so particular a
friend of Mr E’s I had a great
curiosity to meet him ‘My friend
Knightley’ had been so often
mentioned that I was really
impatient to see him and I must do
my cara sposo the justice to say
that he need not be at all ashamed
of his friend Knightley is quite
the gentleman I like him very
much

EXT HARTFIELD GROUNDS - DAY 94

Emma and Harriet are walking together Emma very fast
Harriet struggling a little to keep up

EMMA
Knightley I could not have
believed it Knightley Never seen
him in her life before and call
him Knightley

She beheads a flower at the roadside savagely

EMMA (CONTD)
And to discover that he is a
gentleman Upstart vulgar being
with her Mr E and her cara sposo-

Mr Weston appears beaming waving a letter
MR WESTON
Emma The Churchills have settled

at Richmond We shall have our
ball

INT HARTFIELD EMMA’S ROOM - NIGHT 95

Harriet and Emma in their nightgowns with their hair down
are practicing their steps They are taking turns to lead
each other around the room

HARRIET
You dance so beautifully

She mucks up a step and they bump in to one another
EMMA

No You are Frank Churchill Let’s
do it again

INT CROWN BALLROOM - NIGHT 96

The space has been sweetly decorated and really does look
much better by candle-light Musicians are already playing
and a small crowd is milling about

Emma and Harriet come in marvelling at the transformation
But before Emma can enjoy the scene Miss Bates comes in too-

MISS BATES
Well This is brilliant indeed
This is admirable

(MORE )

MISS BATES (CONTD)
Excellently contrived upon my word-
nothing wanting- could not have
imagined- Miss Woodhouse you must
really have had Aladdin’s lamp

This is meeting quite in fairyland-
such a transformation Where shall
we sit where shall we sit
Anywhere where Jane is not ina
draught Where I sit is of no
consequence

Mrs Elton has buttonholed Jane Fairfax and is talking with
equal rapidity over the top of Miss Bates

MRS ELTON
How do you like my gown I do not
know whether it is not over-
trimmed I have the greatest
dislike to the idea of being over-
trimmed- quite a horror of finery
I must put on a few ornaments now
because it is expected A bride
you know must appear like a bride
but my natural taste is all for
simplicity

Emma spots Frank Churchill nearby talking to his father

EMMA
Mr Churchill

He turns and she goes to drop into a pretty curtsey plainly
rehearsed But by the time she rises Frank has already bowed
curtly and is making to move away

FRANK CHURCHILL
Good evening Miss Woodhouse You
will excuse me I must inquire
after good Miss Bates

He goes to speak to Miss Bates leaving Emma confounded

MRS WESTON
Emma

Emma turns Mrs Weston is coming towards her distressed She
is now six months pregnant Mr Weston is by her side His
expression is also concerned

MRS WESTON (CONTD)
It has just occurred to us that Mrs
Elton will expect to be asked to
begin the ball- and she will surely
think Frank ought to ask her

Emma glances at Mrs Elton who is still talking to Jane-

MRS ELTON
And I see very few pearls in the
room except mine

MR WESTON

(to Emma)
Frank cannot break his promise to
you He has promised you the first
two dances Here is the plan I
will ask Mrs Elton The ball is in
Franks honour but it was my
design I will ask her

He hurries off to tell his plan first to Frank who is still
with Miss Bates and then to Mrs Elton

Miss Bates is thrilled to be waited on by Frank

MISS BATES
Such a noble fire I am quite
roasted

Mrs Weston turns to Emma apologetic

MRS WESTON
You must submit to stand second

EMMA
A bride must be first in company
(beat- then sardonic)
It is almost enough to make me
think of marrying

Mrs Elton comes over having left Jane with Miss Bates

MRS ELTON
Jane Fairfax is absolutely
charming I quite rave about Jane
Fairfax A sweet interesting
creature So mild and ladylike- and
with such talents We must exert
ourselves Miss Woodhouse and
endeavour to do something for her
Such talents as hers must not be
suffered to remain unknown

79A

Miss Bates meanwhile is showing Jane off to any and all who
will listen

MISS BATES
How do you like Jane’s hair She
did it all herself Quite
wonderful No hairdresser from
London I think could

Just then Mr Knightley enters He catches Emma’s eye and
smiles at her kindly naturally She returns the smile a
little sadly Already the evening feels a little spoiled

Mr Weston is trying to get a word in with Mrs Elton At
last he manages-

MR WESTON
Mrs Elton Such an honourable
addition to our humble festivities-

MR ELTON
(interposing)
And so fashionable

MR WESTON
Quite Would you grant me the
infinite pleasure of leading us all
in the first dance

She accepts and is led to the top of the dance by Mr Weston

MRS ELTON
Oh must I go first I really am
ashamed to be always leading the
way

eK

Frank comes over bows to Emma and holds out his hand She
takes it and he leads her into the dance

Mr Weston leads with Mrs Elton Frank Churchill and Emma
follow second Three other couples make up the set The music
starts up the couples bow and curtsey and the dance begins

Frank Churchill is a good dancer but somehow the dance isn’t
any fun for Emma He doesn’t smile or talk and seems to be
concentrating on the steps rather than on Emma he’s counting
the beat under his breath

EMMA
(as they dance)
You have been much missed in
Highbury

FRANK CHURCHILL
Have I

He doesn’t offer more They keep dancing Emma tries again

EMMA
How is your aunt

FRANK CHURCHILL
(with repressed anger)
Most reluctant to release me

Emma as they turn about notices that Harriet is alone at
the edge of the room She has been forgotten Mr Elton is
sauntering about Harriet keeps glancing at him miserably

Mrs Weston who is not dancing owing to her pregnancy steps
up to Mr Elton-

MRS WESTON
Do you not dance Mr Elton

MR ELTON
Most readily Mrs Weston if you
will dance with me
(seeing her belly)
Ah- well Perhaps-

MRS WESTON
There is a young lady disengaged
whom I should be very glad to see
dancing Miss Smith

Harriet can hear them perfectly but is trying to pretend
that she can’t She looks wretched

MR ELTON
Miss Smith

Mr Knightley looks up at this and frowns

MR ELTON (CONT’D)
If I were not an old married man-
but my dancing days are over Mrs
Weston You will excuse me

And he leaves Mrs Weston steps around Harriet and goes to
the far side of the room

Harriet is devastated But Mr Knightley who has observed Mr
Elton’s rudeness with disgust puts down his glass of wine
goes to her and quietly extends his hand

MR KNIGHTLEY
Will you dance Miss Smith

Blushing with pleasure Harriet accepts

Emma still dancing is weak with relief and gratitude
Harriet is beaming Mr Knightley leads Harriet to the top of
the floor to wait for the dance to end so they can join the
second

Mr Elton now left alone looks very foolish He tries to
saunter to another part of the room but trips on the rug
and then nimbly rights himself To cover his embarrassment

MR ELTON
My dancing days are behind me

The first dance comes to an end and Mr Knightley and Harriet
take their places to begin the second Emma and Harriet beam
at each other The men bow and the women curtsey and the
second dance begins

OMITTED 97

INT CROWN BALLROOM - LATER - NIGHT 98

The second dance comes to an end Mr Weston escorts Mrs Elton
back to Mr Elton and Frank immediately asks Harriet if she
would like to dance the third dance with him leaving Emma
and Mr Knightley both without partners They both step aside
Emma comes to speak to him at the side of the room

EMMA
Thank you For your kindness to
Harriet

MR KNIGHTLEY
He was unpardonably rude- and he
aimed at wounding more than
Harriet

EMMA
I was completely mistaken in Mr
Elton There is a littleness about
him which you discovered and which
I did not I was fully convinced of
his being in love with Harriet

Mr Knightley glances at her Then kindly

MR KNIGHTLEY
You would have chosen for him
better than he has chosen for
himself Harriet Smith has some
first-rate qualities which Mrs
Elton is totally without She does
you credit Emma as you do her

This warms Emma’s heart more than she can say
Mr Weston is trying to rouse everybody to dance again

MR WESTON
Come Miss Woodhouse Miss Gilbert
Miss Fairfax what are you all
doing We must dance another set
Come Emma set your companions an
example They are lazy They are
all asleep

EMMA
(laughing)
I am ready whenever I am wanted

Mrs Elton has been trying to coax her husband on to the dance
floor He has to explain in a whisper that he can’t dance
Mrs Elton responds furiously and in the skirmish we hear-

MR ELTON
(in a furious whisper)
I am not embarrassing myself

MR KNIGHTLEY
Whom are you going to dance with

EMMA
With you if you will ask me

MR KNIGHTLEY
Will you

EMMA
Indeed I will You have shown that
you can dance and we are not
really so much brother and sister
as to make it improper

MR KNIGHTLEY
(laughing)
Brother and sister No indeed

He holds out his hand smiling and she takes it

INT CROWN BALLROOM - LATER - NIGHT 99

They go hand in hand to the top of the floor The music
strikes up they bow and curtsey then begin to dance Mr
Knightley never breaks eye contact At first he’s smiling
and Emma is too But as the dance goes on their smiles fade
and their breath shortens They are looking openly at one
another for the first time in their lives

EXT CROWN INN - DAWN 100
The ball has lasted until dawn and the guests are only just
leaving Emma exits to where the coachmen now very tired
are waiting by the carriages to take people home

She looks around for Mr Knightley before she gets in but
can’t see him James helps her into the carriage and shuts
the door and the carriage drives off-

-just as Mr Knightley comes to the door He looks after the
departing carriage tortured Has he missed his moment to
tell Emma how he feels

Suddenly decisive he sets off after the carriage

INT HARTFIELD GREAT HALL - DAWN 104

The hall is deserted the servants are still in bed Emma
steps in taking off her gloves She is confused

INT HARTFIELD UPPER CORRIDOR - DAWN 105

Emma is going upstairs but she’s too restless to sleep She
flops down on a window-seat still thinking about the ball
and then she turns to the window and sits up Mr Knightley
is approaching outside He sees her through the glass and
falters They hold each other’s gaze for a beat Her breath
catches- why has he come Then she leaves the window seat and
runs downstairs

EXT HARTFIELD COURTYARD - DAWN 106

She exits to meet him But when he sees her all his
confidence fails He can’t think of what to say and she
can’t either A beat- and then Emma sees over his shoulder
Frank Churchill who is hurrying towards her carrying
Harriet Mr Knightley turns too

EMMA
Mr Churchill What has happened

FRANK CHURCHILL
(out of breath)
She was set upon by gypsies as she
was coming home- when she attempted
escape she fell She had a cramp-

HARRIET
(weakly heroic)
From too much dancing

EMMA
Is she hurt

MR KNIGHTLEY
Her ankle

FRANK CHURCHILL
I did not see it I arrived moments
after and brought her here- I
could think of no other place

HARRIET
It was on account of the scissors

EMMA
The scissors

FRANK CHURCHILL

(a little embarrassed)
I had borrowed a pair of scissors
from Miss Bates I was halfway home
to Richmond when I made the
recollection and so doubled back

(defensive to Mr

Knightley)
What’s your purpose here

MR KNIGHTLEY
(lying)
My carriage- my horse threw a shoe

EMMA
(surprised)
You took your carriage to the ball

MR KNIGHTLEY
I-

HARRIET
What might have become of me Miss
Woodhouse if not for the scissors

Something about this story seems strange to Mr Knightley He
looks sharply at Frank and then at Emma But there’s no time
to ask for more information they have reached the house Mr
Knightley holds the door open for them and Frank and Emma
help Harriet into the house

INT HARTFIELD GOLD DRAWING ROOM - DAWN 107

Frank Churchill lays Harriet down on a sofa and she cries out
in pain

FRANK CHURCHILL
Her ankle is turned

EMMA
We must send for Perry

FRANK CHURCHILL
And I will rouse my father We
ought to give notice that there are
gypsies in the neighbourhood

MR KNIGHTLEY
Mrs Goddard should have assurance
of her safety

As they have been talking Harriet has whispered to Emma

HARRIET
Miss Woodhouse- I believe I am in
love again

MR KNIGHTLEY
Let us go at once

Frank is already on his way out the door Impulsively-

EMMA
Mr Churchill Do not go Please

Mr Knightley is hurt by this Emma doesn’t notice his hurt
because just then Mr Woodhouse appears He’s appalled

MR WOODHOUSE
What is the matter What has
happened Is she alive

Harriet is patently alive

EMMA
Harriet is unharmed papa We owe
our thanks to Mr Churchill
(to Frank)
Please stay Mr Knightley can sound
the alarm

MR KNIGHTLEY
(angry suddenly)
We will both go

He takes Frank’s arm and bundles him out But Mr Woodhouse
has caught the word-

MR WOODHOUSE
Why are we alarmed

Bartholomew has appeared He fumbles for the vinaigrette

HARRIET
Oh Miss Woodhouse-

EMMA
Say nothing more I am determined
against all interference

She looks around for the men But Mr Knightley and Frank
Churchill have gone She’s a little disappointed but too
excited by Harriet’s new prospects to sulk

EMMA (CONTD)
I was very wrong before I will be
cautious now Let no name ever pass
our lips

Mr Woodhouse is electrified But his vinaigrette isn’t
working

MR WOODHOUSE

Freshen the sponge Bartholomew
And we must have a bowl of gruel
very thin

(remembering Emma)
Two bowls

(feeling hungry)
In fact three

Emma meanwhile can’t resist going on

EMMA
He is your superior no doubt but
more wonderful things have taken
place there have been matches of
greater disparity

HARRIET
Oh Miss Woodhouse believe me I
have not the presumption to
suppose- indeed I am not so mad

EMMA
The service he rendered you-

HARRIET
Service Oh The very recollection
of it and all that I felt- when I
saw him coming- his noble look-
such a change in one moment from
misery to perfect happiness

not having said what he wanted to say

Suddenly he can’t bear the stricture of his cravat his
jacket his waistcoat He begins tearing at his clothes

thought examining her feelings wondering if she can dare
admit them even to herself

INT RANDALLS DINING ROOM - DAY 109

Mrs Elton Mr Knightley Emma and Jane Fairfax are playing
cards while the others take tea and converse

MRS ELTON
What is this I hear dear Jane
about your going to the post office
in the rain last week You sad
girl how could you do such a
thing We will not allow you to do
such a thing again I shall speak
to Mr E The man who fetches our
letters (one of our men I forget
his name) shall inquire for yours
too I shall arrange it

JANE FAIRFAX
(glancing at Mr Knightley)
You are extremely kind but I
cannot give up my daily walk I am
advised to be out of doors as much
as I can I must walk somewhere
and the post-office is an object

Emma has caught the glance between Jane and Mr Knightley She
feels hurt

MRS ELTON

Oh But in the rain And it is a
kindness to employ our men

(impishly to Emma)
Do you suppose Mr Knightley might
extend us all an invitation to the
Abbey Miss Woodhouse I love to
explore great houses and I fear I
have long exhausted Highbury

EMMA
I’m afraid Mr Knightley’s concerns
are all for his tenants and none
for his house Mrs Elton

(MORE )

88A

EMMA (CONTD)
His ballrooms and picture galleries
are quite shut up

She means this teasingly But Mr Knightley surprises her
Flatly without meeting Emma’s eye
MR KNIGHTLEY
I should be very glad to open
Donwell for your exploration Mrs
Elton The welcome is long overdue

Emma is a little put out He’s still avoiding her eye

MRS ELTON
I should like that of all things
Name your day and I will come

(with tart politeness)
I cannot name a day till I have
spoken to some others whom I would
wish to form the party

Emma glances jealously at Jane Fairfax

MRS ELTON
Oh Leave all that to me It is my
party I will invite your guests

MR KNIGHTLEY
I hope you will bring Elton but I
will not trouble you to give any
other invitations

MRS ELTON
Oh Now you are looking very sly
But consider you need not be
afraid of delegating power to me I
am no young lady on her preferment
Married women you know may be
safely authorised

MR KNIGHTLEY
(getting cross)
There is but one married woman in
the world whom I can ever allow to
invite what guests she pleases to
Donwell

MRS ELTON
(deflated)
Mrs Weston I suppose

MR KNIGHTLEY
No Mrs Knightley and till she is
in being I will manage such
matters myself

EXT DONWELL ABBEY - DAY (SUMMER) 110

It’s a brilliant day Donwell Abbey is gorgeously grand

The party- Mr Knightley Harriet Emma Jane Fairfax Mr and
Mrs Elton Mr and Mrs Weston (now seven months pregnant) Mrs
Bates Miss Bates and Mr Woodhouse are roaming the grounds
in front of the house

Mr Knightley is walking with Harriet a little apart from the
others He is explaining a feature on the distant hillside
while Harriet listens Mr Weston and Mr Elton have paired
off Miss Bates and Mrs Weston are walking together and Mr
Woodhouse is strolling with Mrs Bates This leaves Emma Mrs
Elton and Jane Fairfax in an unlikely trio

MRS ELTON

(taking Emma’s arm)
Now Miss Woodhouse you must
assist me I have found a post for
dear Jane as a governess The
family is delightfully superior-
the first in their set- and I am
wild to have the offer closed
immediately

JANE FAIRFAX
I thank you Mrs Elton for your-

MRS ELTON
(talking over her)
I refuse to take her negative and
insist on being authorised to write
an acquiescence by tomorrow’s post

JANE FAIRFAX
(loudly masking anger)
Will not Mr Knightley show us the
house

Mr Knightley stops talking to Harriet and looks at her
surprised Everyone is surprised to see this flash of spirit
from Jane whose face is suddenly very flushed

JANE FAIRFAX (CONT’D)

All of the house I wish to see the
whole extent

INT DONWELL DOUBLE CUBE - DAY 112

The dust sheets have been taken away and the chandeliers
unbagged The place looks splendid though still very like a
museum The party- Jane Fairfax Miss Bates Emma Harriet
Mr Woodhouse Mr and Mrs Weston Mr and Mrs Elton and Mr
Knightley- file through the entrance to the double cube and
break off in to pairs to look around the Picture Gallery

MISS BATES

(to Jane)
Do you not feel transported I can
hardly believe that we remain in
England I have never set my foot
beyond the Abbey Mill Once my dear
father your dear grandpapa
ventured to Bath on a clerical
errand and I was to accompany him
but the night before his going I
was struck down by fever and so I
did not go He brought me back a
jet brooch as a memento- I have it
still Bath I hear is a great
metropolis Every face a stranger
But you know a great deal more of
the world than I You have been to
Ireland and to Weymouth

(gesturing at a picture)
Now Jane This is just how I fancy
Mr Dixon Exactly with this look
Am I right

JANE FAIRFAX
Quite wrong my dear aunt There is
no likeness at all

She disengages and moves away to join Mr Knightley

MISS BATES
Very odd But one never does form a
just idea of any body beforehand
One takes up a notion and runs
away with it

She realises that she’s alone and bustles off to join the
Westons

Mrs Elton standing with Mr Elton sees Mr Woodhouse
approaching on his own and says to her husband-

MRS ELTON
Here comes this dear old beau of
mine I protest I like him
excessively

(MORE )

91a

MRS ELTON (CONTD)
His quaint old-fashioned
politeness is much more to my taste
than modern ease modern ease often
disgusts me

Mr Weston meanwhile is enthusing to Mrs Weston and Miss
Bates-—

MR WESTON
Now Enscombe is fine- the rooms are
large- but there is no collection
such as this

Emma and Harriet are looking at the pictures together Emma
glances at Mr Knightley and Jane feeling jealous Jane moves
away and Mr Knightley comes over to Emma and Harriet Emma
expects he’s going to speak to her but

MR KNIGHTLEY
There is a fine prospect from the
south window Miss Smith May I
escort you

Flushing with pleasure Harriet follows him into the adjacent
room Emma stays where she is She looks up at the vast
panelled wall of pictures all landscapes and seascapes
vistas of countries and places she has never seen Lost in
thought she moves down the hall looking at each picture
But then-

JANE FAIRFAX
Will you be so kind when I am
missed to say that I am gone home

Emma turns in surprise Jane looks stressed The room has
emptied and they’re now alone

EMMA
Certainly if you wish it but you
are not going to walk to Highbury
alone

A beat Jane seems on the verge of disclosing something

EMMA (CONTD)
Are you unwell

JANE FAIRFAX
(with rare directness)
Miss Woodhouse we all know at
times what it is to be wearied in
spirits Mine I confess are
exhausted
91B

Again she seems on the verge of saying something more But 113 INT DONWELL ABBEY SINGLE CUBE HALL OF STATUES
she just curtseys and departs leaving Emma mystified - LATER - DAY

Miss Bates is now walking with her mother

Emma diverts her course to avoid Miss Bates
to face with Frank Churchill He’s looking very hot and

bothered

MISS BATES
Such treasures- so unlike anything-
behold the continent has come to
us Mother if each could speak
how silent we would be how
fervidly we would listen Such
wonders One’s very spirit soars
One feels a kind of- is not Mr
Knightley kind to open up his great
house- and so very discerning with
such an eye- magnificent specimen
I am quite transported I fancy
myself in an altogether different-—
even to speak the names- France
Italy Prussia It is too
thrilling Such exotic delights

FRANK CHURCHILL
Have I missed the party

EMMA
Not at all We are exploring the
house

and comes face

Frank Churchill mops his face and paces He’s very cross

FRANK CHURCHILL
I was detained by my aunt A
nervous seizure which lasted some
hours Had I known how hot a ride I
should have I believe I should not
have come at all

EMMA
You will soon be cooler if you sit
down

FRANK CHURCHILL
As soon as I am cooler I shall go
back again You will all be going
soon the party is breaking up

EMMA
You need refreshment Some cold
beer perhaps
92A 93

EMMA (CONTD)

She addresses this to a servant who bows and withdraws Emma Cannot you invent a few hardships
moves off Frank pacing follows her for yourself and be contented to
stay
FRANK CHURCHILL
As soon as my aunt gets well I FRANK CHURCHILL
shall go abroad I am tired of You are quite mistaken I do not
doing nothing I want a change look upon myself as either
(she glances at him) prosperous or indulged I am
I am serious Miss Woodhouse thwarted in every thing material I
whatever your penetrating eyes may do not consider myself at alla
fancy I am sick of England I fortunate person
would leave it tomorrow if I
could The servant reappears with a tankard of beer on a tray Frank
downs it and then the servant discreetly withdraws
EMMA
You are sick of prosperity and EMMA
indulgence We are going to Box Hill tomorrow
(MORE ) It is not the Grand Tour but it

will be something for a young man
so much in want of change

The others are now returning having completed their tour
FRANK CHURCHILL
Well- if you wish me to stay and
join the party I will

This is alarming But Emma doesn’t have time to reply Mr
Weston has spied his son and already exclaiming-—

MR WESTON
Frank We had quite given you up

Frank turns away switching on a smile for his father

114 EXT BOX HILL CARRIAGE TURNOFF - MORNING 114

The carriages have arrived The party is already fanning out
over the field exploring Mr and Mrs Elton Miss Bates Jane
Fairfax Mr Knightley Emma Harriet Mr Weston and Frank
The servants go on ahead with the picnic

MISS BATES
How very lovely indeed Is it not
very lovely Jane

But even as she says it she’s batting away bugs

115 EXT BOX HILL - DAY 115

They’re all rather out of breath walking up the hill It is
very hot and muggy Everyone is sweating
115A

EXT BOX HILL - A LITTLE LATER - DAY 115A

A little later Everyone is seated Frank Churchill is lying
on his back with his ankles crossed and his hands behind his
head He turns to Emma who is seated next to him

FRANK CHURCHILL
How much I am obliged to you for
telling me to come today I had
quite determined to go away again

EMMA
Yes you were very cross I was a
kinder friend than you deserved

FRANK CHURCHILL
Don’t say I was cross I was
fatigued The heat overcame me

EMMA
It is hotter today

FRANK CHURCHILL
Not to my feelings I am perfectly
comfortable today

EMMA
You are comfortable because you are
under command

FRANK CHURCHILL
Your command Yes

Mr Knightley looks very sour at this comment

Emma darts a pained look at Harriet but Harriet doesn’t look
concerned She’s making a daisy chain and is preoccupied

EMMA
(shortly)
I meant self-command

She bats away a fly His conversation is annoying her a bit
she senses that he’s toying with her in some way but she
doesn’t know why Frank Churchill senses her annoyance
lowers his voice mischievously and rolls over

FRANK CHURCHILL
Our companions are excessively
stupid What shall we do to rouse
them Any nonsense will serve
(loudly to the group)
(MORE )

FRANK CHURCHILL (CONTD)
Ladies and gentlemen I am ordered
by Miss Woodhouse to say- that she
desires to know what you are all
thinking of

The party looks at him Miss Bates and Harriet smile
nervously Mr Weston anxious as always to think the best of
Frank attempts a jolly laugh But the others are po-faced

MISS BATES
(anxiously)
Oh dear What we’re thinking of

MR KNIGHTLEY
(icy)
Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she
would like to hear what we are all
thinking of

EMMA
Oh- no no upon no account in the
world It is the very last thing I
would stand the brunt of just now

MRS ELTON
It is a sort of thing which I
should not have thought myself
privileged to enquire into As the
chaperon of the party

MR ELTON
Very true my love very true- but
some ladies say anything Better
pass it off as a joke Everybody
knows what is due to you

FRANK CHURCHILL

(to Emma)

It will not do They are most of
them affronted I will attack them
with more address

(getting up on his knees)
Ladies and gentlemen- I am ordered
by Miss Woodhouse to say that she
waives her right of knowing what
you may be thinking of and only
requires something entertaining
from each of you She demands
either one thing very clever or
two things moderately clever or
three things very dull indeed and
she engages to laugh heartily at
them all
96 97

MR WESTON (CONTD)
He is so preposterous that Emma can’t help but laugh What two letters of the alphabet
are there that express perfection

MISS BATES

Oh Very well then I need not be
uneasy ‘Three things very dull
indeed’ That will just do for me
you know I shall be sure to say

EMMA
What two letters- express
perfection I am sure I do not
know

three dull things as soon as I open
my mouth Her eagerness to know the answer is feigned She darts
another nervous glance at Miss Bates feeling awful
EMMA

Ah Ma’am but there may be a MISS BATES

difficulty You will be limited to (to Mr Knightley quietly)

number- only three at once I must have made myself very

disagreeable or she would not have

She had meant it lightly gaily in continuation of Frank said such a thing to an old friend
Churchill’s outrageousness but Miss Bates recoils as if she

had been slapped Her eyes fill with tears MR WESTON
Ah You will never guess You I am
MISS BATES certain you will never guess I
Ah- well- to be sure- yes I see will tell you M and A Em-ma Do
what she means I will try to hold you understand
my tongue

Frank laughs But nobody else does Emma feels dreadful to
be praised right after having been so cruel She manages only

Emma is appalled at herself But how can she patch it up She
a pained smile for Mr Weston Miss Bates sniffs audibly

glances at Frank but he has turned away smothering a cruel

smile in private satisfaction at Miss Bates’ shame

MR WESTON
(oblivious to the tension)
I like your plan Agreed agreed I
will do my best I am making a
conundrum How will a conundrum
reckon

FRANK CHURCHILL
Low I am afraid sir very low
but we shall be indulgent
especially to anyone who leads the
way

EMMA
(trying now to be kind)
No no it will not reckon low
Come sir Pray let us hear it

She glances at Harriet seeking help but Harriet is looking

at Miss Bates who is discreetly wiping away tears

MR WESTON
I doubt it’s being very clever
myself It is too much a matter of
fact but here it is

(MORE )

MR KNIGHTLEY
(acidly)
Mr Weston has shown us how to play
this game but also how to end it
Who can improve upon ‘perfection’

MRS ELTON
I protest I must be excused I do
not pretend to be a wit I have a
great deal of vivacity in my own
way but I really must be allowed
to judge when to speak and when to
hold my tongue

MR ELTON
Shall we walk Augusta

MRS ELTON
(getting up)
Most willingly I really am tired
of exploring so long on one spot

JANE FAIRFAX
(to Miss Bates)
Shall we join Mrs Elton ma’am

MISS BATES
(thickly through tears)
If you please my dear With all my
heart I am quite ready

They leave together Mr Knightley gets up too He looks
disgusted He stalks off Now only Mr Weston Frank Emma
and Harriet remain Mr Weston smiles at them all But the
mood is spoiled Nobody returns his smile

INT EMMAS CARRIAGE - LATER - DAY 116

Emma has just settled herself in her carriage ready to
depart when the door is wrenched open by Mr Knightley

MR KNIGHTLEY
How could you be so unfeeling to
Miss Bates

EMMA
It was not so very bad-

MR KNIGHTLEY
(without pausing)
How could you be so insolent to a
woman of her character age and
situation

EMMA
I dare say she did not understand
me

MR KNIGHTLEY
I assure you she did She felt your
full meaning She has talked of it
since

EMMA
Oh I know there is not a better
creature in the world-

MR KNIGHTLEY
(talking over her)
I wish you could have heard how she
talked of it- with what candour and
generosity

EMMA
You must allow that what is good
and what is ridiculous are most
unfortunately blended in her

MR KNIGHTLEY
They are blended I acknowledge-

Emma knows what’s coming and knows that she deserves it but
she can’t help trying to divert him from his speech

EMMA
Oh it’s so hot and I’m so tired-

MR KNIGHTLEY

(without having paused)
-and were she a woman of fortune
I would not quarrel with you for
any liberties of manner But she is
poor She has sunk from the
comforts she was born to and if
she live to old age she will
probably sink more She has seen
you grow up from when her notice of
you was an honour To have you now
in thoughtless spirits and the
pride of the moment laugh at her
humble her- and before her niece
too- and before others many of
whom are entirely guided by your
treatment of her It was badly done
indeed

Emma has welled up but she is willing herself not to cry

INT EMMA’S CARRIAGE - LATER - DAY 117

Emma is freely sobbing now as the carriage rattles back
towards Hartfield

OMITTED 118

INT HARTFIELD UPPER CORRIDOR WINDOW SEAT - LATER - DAY 119

Emma is sitting in her window-seat desolate Mr Woodhouse
comes and sits down next to her He offers her his
vinaigrette She smiles weakly through her tears but doesn’t
take it A beat

120A

120B

EMMA
I have been unpardonably vain and
insufferably arrogant I have been
inconsiderate and indelicate and
irrational and unfeeling-

MR WOODHOUSE
(gently)
Emma You are young

EXT MRS BATES’ ROOMS - DAY 120

Emma approaches Mrs Bates’ front door She is holding a gift
basket full of produce

INT MRS BATES’ ROOMS - DAY 120A

Jane is playing Beethoven Sonata No23 ‘Apassionata’ on the
pianoforte Miss Bates is standing by the window

INT MRS BATES’ ROOMS STAIRWELL - DAY 120B

The sound of Jane Fairfax playing filters into the stairwell
Emma climbs the stairs but when she reaches the door she
doesn’t knock right away She feels unbearably sad She
starts to cry Finally she works up her nerve to knock The
playing stops at once

INT MRS BATES’ ROOMS - DAY 121

Emma waits in the doorway still holding the basket

Miss Bates shuts the interior door to the room where Jane is
and says to Emma apologetically

MISS BATES
I am afraid Jane is not very well
A dreadful headache writing all
morning such long letters I said
my dear you will blind yourself

EMMA
I am sorry to hear it Miss Bates
Please give her my good wishes

MISS BATES

How kind you are You were kept
waiting at the door- I was quite
ashamed- but somewhere there was a
little bustle- for it so happened
that we had not heard the knock
and till you were on the stairs we
did not know anybody was coming

100A

Emma offers the basket Miss Bates takes it
MISS BATES (CONTD)
So very kind But you are always
kind Miss Woodhouse

It’s too awful Emma is almost on the verge of tears again

INT HARTFIELD GOLD DRAWING ROOM - DAY 122

Emma comes in and sees that Mr Knightley is with her father
She can hardly meet his gaze

MR WOODHOUSE
How did you find them Emma has
been to call on Mrs and Miss Bates
Mr Knightley She is always so
attentive to them

Emma can hardly look at Mr Knightley He rescues her by
changing the subject a little abruptly

MR KNIGHTLEY
I am going to Brunswick Square for
the remainder of the season

MR WOODHOUSE
I do wish you would reconsider

EMMA
(hurt)
Is not this a sudden scheme

MR KNIGHTLEY
Yes- rather- no I have been
thinking about it for some time

MR WOODHOUSE
We will miss you in the evenings

Mr Knightley comes to Emma takes her hand and seems about
to press it to his lips- but then he drops it and bows

MR KNIGHTLEY
Goodbye Emma
EXT HARTFIELD - DAY 123

It’s a blazing day in summer

OMITTED 124

INT RANDALLS DRAWING ROOM - A FEW DAYS LATER - DAY 125

Mrs Weston now nine months pregnant is propped up on a day
bed The door opens and Mr Weston ushers Emma in He looks
worried Mrs Weston reaches out to Emma

EMMA
What has happened What is the
news

She addresses the question to both of them Mr Weston remains
in the doorway hovering anxiously He’s embarrassed and
doesn’t want to come in

MRS WESTON
Oh Emma
(helplessly)
Mrs Churchill is dead

EMMA
Dead

She looks at Mr Weston not understanding- why is the news
being delivered in this way Mr Weston looks embarrassed
rather than mournful

MR WESTON
We always thought her illness was
invented

Emma still doesn’t understand There has to be something
else She looks from Mr Weston to Mrs Weston queryingly

EMMA
(trying to laugh)
You frightened me I thought you
must have lost all your money

MRS WESTON

Emma
(looking very worried)

Frank has been here this very
morning on the most extraordinary
errand It is impossible to express
our surprise Frank and Jane
Fairfax are engaged

EMMA
What
102A 103

She turns to Mr Weston But he has turned away He can’t look MRS WESTON

at her There has been a solemn engagement
between them ever since October-
formed at Weymouth and kept a
secret from everybody

EMMA
What Engaged to her all winter-
before either of them came to
Highbury

MRS WESTON
Secretly engaged Of course had
his aunt known of it she would
have cut him off It has hurt me
Emma very much It has hurt his
father equally

EMMA
(suddenly)
He sent the pianoforte

MR WESTON
He has confessed it

MRS WESTON
(beat- awkwardly)
Emma You must know it was our
darling wish-

But Emma puts her hand on Mrs Weston’s silencing her

EMMA
There was a period in the early
part of our acquaintance when I
did like him but I have really for
some time cared nothing for him
You may believe me Mrs Weston He
has done me no harm

Mr Weston looks inexpressibly relieved He manages a smile

126 INT MRS GODDARDS SCHOOL HARRIET’S ROOM - LATER - DAY 126

Emma has come to visit Harriet They are sitting on her bed

EMMA
I am so very sorry Harriet

HARRIET
But why should you condole me You
do not think I care about Mr Frank
Churchill

EMMA
(thrown)
There was a time- and not very
distant either- when you gave me
reason to understand that you did
care about him

HARRIET
Him Never Dear Miss Woodhouse
how could you so mistake me

EMMA
(genuinely taken aback)
Harriet What do you mean

HARRIET
I should not have thought it
possible that you could have
misunderstood me I know we agreed
never to name him- but considering
how infinitely superior he is to
everybody else I could not have
been supposed to mean any other
man Mr Frank Churchill indeed
That you should have been so
mistaken is amazing Had I not
believed you entirely approved my
attachment I should have
considered it too great a
presumption even to dare to think
of him But you told me that more
wonderful things had happened that
there had been matches of greater
disparity- those were your very
words Miss Woodhouse-

EMMA
Harriet Let us understand each
other now without the possibility
of farther mistake Are you
speaking of- Mr Knightley

HARRIET
Of course I thought you knew

EMMA
But the service Mr Churchill
rendered you in protecting you
from the gypsies-

HARRIET
Oh dear no it was not the

gypsies
(MORE)

HARRIET (CONTD)
No- I was thinking of a much more
precious circumstance- of Mr
Knightley’s coming and asking me to
dance when Mr Elton would not
stand up with me That was the
service

EMMA
Good God

(beat- then with dread)
And have you any idea of Mr
Knightley’s returning your
affection

HARRIET

Yes I must say that I have

(with gentle defiance)
He talks to me Much more than he
used to He has shown sweetness
and kindness and at Donwell he
took great pains to describe to me
some particulars of the management
of his tenant farms We were
interrupted but before we were he
seemed almost to be asking if my
affections were engaged

EMMA
But is it not possible that he
might have been alluding to Mr
Martin- that he might have had Mr
Martin’s interest in view

And all at once Harriet realises

HARRIET
You think of Mr Knightley for
yourself

Emma is shocked to hear it put into words so simply

EMMA
Harriet-

Harriet finds her unbearable suddenly She stands up

EMMA (CONTD)
(more desperately)
I do not flatter myself with any
idea of his attachment to me I
have received very recent proof of
his impartiality-

HARRIET
I should never have presumed to
think of him but for you

EMMA
(even more desperately)
I know that he is the last man in
the world who would intentionally
give any woman the idea of his
feeling more for her than he really
does If you believe he loves you-

HARRIET
I refused Mr Martin because of you
Because of you Miss Woodhouse-
But she can’t manage any more She runs out The door slams
leaving Emma alone in Harriet’s room

EXT HARTFIELD - NEARING SUNSET 127

Emma is making her way back to Hartfield slowly She’s
morose She looks up and sees to her shock Mr Knightley

EMMA
Mr Knightley

He doesn’t speak He seems a little paralysed She is too

EMMA (CONTD)
Have you heard the news

MR KNIGHTLEY
Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill

EMMA
I did not see it But I seem to
have been doomed to blindness

MR KNIGHTLEY
(bursting out)
Time my dearest Emma time will
heal the wound He will soon be
gone You will forget him

EMMA
(starting to cry)

You are very kind- but you are
mistaken My blindness to what was
going on led me to act in a way
that I must always be ashamed of
but I have no other regret

(MORE )

EMMA (CONTD)
(then to qualify)
With respect to Mr Churchill

MR KNIGHTLEY
He is a disgrace to the name of
man And is he to be rewarded with
that sweet young woman Jane Jane
you will be a miserable creature

Emma is silent She can’t bear to condole him about Jane

After a beat Mr Knightley goes on tightly-

MR KNIGHTLEY (CONT’D)
Everything turns out for his good
His aunt is in the way His aunt
dies He uses everybody ill- and
they are delighted to forgive him
He is a fortunate man indeed

EMMA
You speak as if you envied him

MR KNIGHTLEY
And I do envy him Emma In one
respect he is the object of my
envy

Silence again then-

MR KNIGHTLEY (CONT’D)
You will not ask me why You are
determined I see to have no
curiosity You are wise- but I
cannot be wise Emma I must tell
you what you will not ask though I
May wish it unsaid the next moment

EMMA
Oh Then do not speak it Do not
speak it Take a little time
consider do not commit yourself

He tears himself away deeply agitated A beat then Emma

takes a shaky breath and composes herself Bravely

EMMA (CONTD)
I stopped you ungraciously just
now Mr Knightley If you wish to
speak to me as a friend or to ask
my opinion- as a friend I will
hear whatever you like

MR KNIGHTLEY

As a friend Emma that I fear is a
word-

(seizing her)
Tell me Emma have I no chance of
ever succeeding My dearest Emma
for dearest you will always be my
dearest most beloved Emma tell me
at once Say No if it is to be
said I cannot make speeches Emma
If I loved you less I might be
able to talk about it more But you
know what I am I have blamed you
and lectured you and you have
borne it as no other woman in
England could have borne it God
knows I have been a very
indifferent lover But you
understand me You understand my
feelings

EMMA
(shocked)
Mr Knightley I-

She finds she can’t go on She’s in shock He takes her in
his arms tremblingly unable to believe he’s touching her-

MR KNIGHTLEY
Will you marry me

Suddenly shockingly she gets a nosebleed Without thinking
he darts out a hand to staunch the blood- and she jerks her
head back smearing blood- and she’s trying not to get blood
on her dress- and he’s fumbling for his handkerchief-

EMMA
I- I cannot 128

The smeared blood has given her a vampiric look

MR KNIGHTLEY
Why not
EMMA
Harriet
MR KNIGHTLEY
Harriet

EMMA
She is in love with you

A beat Mr Knightley laughs- not unkindly but in disbelief

MR KNIGHTLEY
Emma-—

EMMA

(starting to cry again)
And she believes that you may love
her too You danced with her- you
have praised her- and shown her
kindness- you took notice of her at
Donwell and spoke of farming- and
seemed on the verge of asking if
her affections were engaged-

MR KNIGHTLEY
To Robert Martin To Robert Martin
(beat)
She told you this

EMMA
I cannot break her heart again

Mr Knightley highly distressed paces a bit Then-

MR KNIGHTLEY
I shall call on Robert Martin this
very evening I shall urge him to
put his suit to Miss Smith a second
time He still loves her I am
certain that he does He need only
ask again- not by letter in person-

She touches his arm silencing him
EMMA
No I must do it I must go

EXT ABBEY MILL LANE - DAY

Emma gets out of the carriage lugging a gift basket which
contains a dressed goose fruit nuts bunches of lavender

and starts to make her way up the hill to the Martin’s farm
But then she stops realising her mistake she looks down at
the dressed goose in the basket and then up at the flock of
geese that are crowding the path ahead But it’s too late to

change plans She sighs and walks on to the stables

110-111

EXT ABBEY MILL STABLES - DAY 130

Robert Martin watches Emma approach with astonishment A
beat neither of them really sure who is going to speak
first Then

EMMA

Mr Martin I have a confession to
make

(beat- haltingly)
I have caused you great suffering
as I have also caused the suffering
of my friend-

(correcting herself)
-my dearest friend

A little later Emma returns down the hill to the carriage
Robert watches her go then turns and looks at Emma’s gift

basket He notices a roll of canvas tied with string that
has been inserted into the spray of lavender at one end He
crosses to it pulls off the ribbon and unrolls it

It’s Emmas painting of Harriet cut from the frame

EXT HIGHBURY LANE - DAY 131

Emma is walking down the road on foot She’s alone She comes
around a bend and sees Frank and Jane both dressed in
mourning They curtsey and bow automatically but then they
all hesitate Nobody is sure who should speak first or what
they should say Frank braves it

FRANK CHURCHILL
Is it possible you had no
suspicion

EMMA
Never the smallest I assure you

FRANK CHURCHILL
I wish I had told you everything I
was once very near

EMMA
It is not now worth the regret

She goes to keep walking But Frank is still trying to
apologise

FRANK CHURCHILL
What an impudent dog I have been
How could I dare

110-111A

EMMA
I do suspect you had very great
amusement in tricking us all

She steps around them and goes to continue walking

Jane finds the courage to speak at last She leaves Frank and
hurries anxiously after Emma

JANE FAIRFAX
Miss Woodhouse I am so sorry I
have not time for half of what I
wish to say

EMMA
You owe me no apologies

JANE FAIRFAX
You are very kind but I know what
my manners were to you So cold and
artificial I had always a part to
act It was a life of deceit I
know that I must have disgusted
you

Frank is hovering just out of earshot Emma glances at him

EMMA
(thoughtfully)

I think there is a little likeness
between myself and Mr Churchill If
not in our dispositions then
perhaps in our destiny We shall
both marry people far far better
than ourselves

Jane is gratified by the compliment but she doesn’t quite
understand Emma’s meaning

JANE FAIRFAX
You have a secretive engagement

EMMA
If I had Miss Fairfax then be
assured Frank Churchill should be
the very last to know

Jane allows herself a little smile Emma takes Jane’s hand
and presses it For the first time in their acquaintance
they both feel as if they might become friends

INT HARTFIELD EMMA’S ROOM - DAY 132 133

Emma comes in to find Harriet waiting for her The dynamic of
Harriet’s first arrival at Hartfield is entirely reversed
this time Emma is apprehensive Harriet cool and controlled

EMMA
Harriet

HARRIET
Mr Robert Martin has offered me
his hand
(beat)
I have accepted him

It’s unbelievably tense Harriet is testing her

EMMA
Then he is the most fortunate man
of my acquaintance

But still Harriet doesn’t smile A beat then

EMMA (CONTD)
Harriet

But Harriet has something to say

HARRIET
There is something else I have had
a letter from my father Now that I
have come of age he has revealed
himself He is a tradesman In
Bristol He makes galoshes He
comes to Highbury next week on
purpose to meet with me

It’s the final test will Emma baulk at her now But Emma
doesn’t flinch

EMMA
I hope that you will bring him to
Hartfield

Harriet’s eyes flood with tears Emma is overcome She
crosses the room to her and hugs her tight

INT HARTFIELD GOLD DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT 133

Mr Woodhouse Mr Knightley and Emma are all in their habitual
places reading- except that Mr Knightley and Emma can’t
concentrate and keep stealing glances at one another

MR WOODHOUSE
(suddenly)
Do you feel a draught Mr
Knightley About your knees

MR KNIGHTLEY
I cannot say that I do sir

MR WOODHOUSE
Ah Pity

But then Mr Knightley has an idea Suddenly

MR KNIGHTLEY
In fact- yes sir A chill draught

MR WOODHOUSE
(instantly galvanised)
A chill- the screen the screen
Bartholomew Make haste

Bartholomew rushes to unfold it But Mr Knightley has been
cunning Mr Woodhouse is now blocked from view Mr Knightley
can reach over and take her hand

EMMA
(in a whisper)
How can I ever leave him

MR KNIGHTLEY
(also whispering)
He can remove with you to Donwell

Mr Woodhouse is directing Bartholomew to the window to stuff
handkerchiefs into the cracks observing anxiously to make
sure it’s done correctly Emma and Mr Knightley are still
whispering

EMMA
You know he never would He could
not stand it

MR KNIGHTLEY
Then I shall come here

EMMA
You would quit the Abbey
MR KNIGHTLEY
Yes

EMMA
Sacrifice your independence

MR KNIGHTLEY
Yes

113A

EMMA
Live constantly with my father in
no house of your own

MR KNIGHTLEY
Yes

MR WOODHOUSE (0S)
How it is now Mr Knightley

MR KNIGHTLEY
(with his eyes on Emma)
It’s much better now

And at last they kiss

to the side of the altar

Mr Knightley is standing at the altar nervous facing front

Emma and Mr Woodhouse appear at the door of the church Mr
Woodhouse is a little tearful He sniffs Emma turns to him

anxious

EMMA
Papa Are you unwell

MR WOODHOUSE
Unwell What a ridiculous question

They process down the aisle Emma looks radiant and even Mr
Woodhouse looks happy Mr Knightley can’t help but turn to
sneak a glance at her

Mrs Elton wants the last word As Emma and Mr Woodhouse pass
she turns around and says to Miss Bates

MRS ELTON
You know I made that match myself

altar and wordlessly he reaches out and takes her hand

The End
