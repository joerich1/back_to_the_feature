THE KINGS SPEECH

Written by

David Seidler

OPEN ON

1 INT BATHROOM YORK HOUSE LONDON - DAY (MID-1930S)

A shimmering surface of cold water - held in an immense free
standing white enamelled bathtub with gilded lions legs -
bulges in SLOW MOTION to the chords of Handels Trumpet
Volunteer

A head emerges

White gloved hands in livery rush to envelope the surfacing
naked wet body in white towels

2 INT DRESSING CHAMBER YORK HOUSE - DAY

The ritual continues with crisp military precision

CLOSE ON the Royal Coat Of Arms stamped in gold lion and
unicorn embrace a shield divided into four quarters with harp
thistle and more lions denoting England Ireland Scotland and
Wales The shield is surmounted by a crown

This emblem is on a cuff-link fastened on a starched white
shirt

Trousers pressed to a knife-edge are held for stockinged feet
and gartered legs to be inserted

Mirror-polished boots are laced tight
Jacket held ready Arms shoulders chest received

Glistening medals attached to front of jacket create a dazzling
field of ribbons and medallions

Epaulets edged with gold braid tassels are adjusted

Polished buttons are fastened
WwW

Multi-coloured collar clasped shut

White ostrich feathers topping a tri-corner hat are fluffed
and placed upon brilliantined hair

PAN DOWN to the handsome features of Albert Duke of York known
to his family as BERTIE Hes in his late thirties the second
son of King George V the reigning King of England He conveys a
sensitivity which appears in conflict with the manner in which
hes been bedecked

Reflected in a full length mirror Bertie tells himself

BERTIE

You look like a Christmas tree

He smiles wanly

EXT INNER COURTYARD YORK HOUSE 145 PICADILLY - DAY

THE ROYAL STANDARD flaps atop a gleaming chrome grill
Liveried footmen open the doors of a stately Austin Princess

Bertie exits York House with his young wife - ELIZABETH -
considered by all to be one of the loveliest women in the land
truly an English rose Golden Labradors and Corgis appear from
all directions weaving between them barking boisterously
creating a happy chaos

Elizabeth and Bertie glance upwards and wave

Two little girls LILIBET and MARGARET ROSE aged eight and
four wave back from their nursery window

INTEXT AUSTIN PRINCESS HYDE PARK CORNER - DAY
Bertie nervously lights a cigarette Elizabeth pats his hand
ELIZABETH
Buck up Bertie The BBC said it wouldnt
rain

BERTIES POV - Speakers Corner with its assortment of orators
prophets protestors and onlookers gathered around soapboxs
ou

oO) OV

agreeing disagreeing shouting comments Others carry
placards sing protest songs A miners strike is the focus of
the day

A large rather untidy workingman with a florid rosacea nose
spots the passing Austin and stares at the occupants

REVERSE ANGLE - Berties face stares back
The first drops splatter against the glass Elizabeth sighs

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
Never trust the wireless

Berties face is obliterated by the increasingly heavy downpour
which segues into a GARGLING sound

INT BBC BROADCASTING STUDIO - DAY

A gentleman in a tuxedo carnation in boutonniere is gargling
while a TECHNICIAN holds a porcelain bowl and a towel at the
ready The man in the tuxedo is a BBC NEWS READER He
expectorates discreetly into the bowl wipes his mouth
fastidiously and signals to ANOTHER TECHNICIAN who produces an
atomizer The Reader opens his mouth squeezes the rubber bulb
and sprays his inner throat Now hes ready He looks to the
control room

The FLOOR MANAGER begins a count-down five four three
two

BBC NEWS READER
Ladies and Gentlemen good afternoon This
is the BBC National and World Programmes
taking you to Wembley Stadium

He speaks in flawless pear-shaped tones Theres no higher
creature in the vocal world

EXT WEMBLEY STADIUM - DAY

ELEVATED SHOT looking down on a sea of dripping black umbrellas
hiding the spectators from view

Bertie and Elizabeth takes their places in a row of gilded
chairs with the other dignitaries They are
KING GEORGE V - a barrel-chested man with Naval beard and
uniform accompanied by his wife

QUEEN MARY - an elegant but icy grande dame

DR COSMO LANG - a tall unctuous churchman with a high domed
balding head and a perpetual expression of moral superiority

WINSTON CHURCHILL - a politician of sixty as portly as Lang is
lean They are bantering rivals in ambition

STANLEY BALDWIN - the Prime Minister of the day Heavy-browed
His hair as always parted down the middle

NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN - Chancellor of the Exchequer Tall thin
lugubrious with the expression of a quizzical chicken hawk

A BBC technician places a huge imposing microphone suspended on
springs next to the stadium equipment It looks frightening
even to us Berties shoulders brace as though expecting a
blow Elizabeth sees his terror

TKSSeidler091708 5

ELIZABETH
Why wasnt he told

COSMO LANG
Ten million people listening around the
world Mam Possibly more
(as though Bertie didnt
exist)
His brother and father have been
broadcasting since last year

The King growing impatient hisses

KING GEORGE V
Get on with it Show what youre made of

Bertie moves forward diffidently without an ounce of
confidence knowing deep within hes doomed His stomach knots
chest muscles contract constricting his breath

BERTIE
Luh-luh-lords la-la-ladies gen-tell-men

It is a shock to realize this is a man with a profound stutter
A man who cannot speak in public

Lang whispers to Churchill When Lang whispers everyone can
hear

COSMO LANG
I wouldnt miss His Highness maiden voyage
for all the world And on such an important
occasion

Lang really is a piece of work

For ease of reading Berties stutter is not indicated from this
point on in the script

BERTIE
No doubt you wish the Prince Of Wales was
standing before you today

POV - a sea of dripping umbrellas No response This is going
to be a torment for him and his audience

INT BBC BROADCASTING STUDIO - DAY
A glowing dial on the face of a studio radio Everyone
listening intently

TKSSeidler091708 6

BERTIE (ON RADIO)
(stuttering profoundly)
Be that as it maymy brother David is
attending to other duties in the furthest
parts of this vast Empire

The radio falls silent Eyes widen in concern

EXT WEMBLEY STADIUM - DAY

Bertie stands frozen his mouth agape jaw muscles locked He
knows hes considered by all especially himself unfit for
public life
Elizabeth is devastated

KING GEORGE V

Just needs more practice

EXT HARLEY STREET - NEW DAY

She waits Coughs No response Calls imperiously

ELIZABETH

From behind a door

LIONEL (0S)
In the lav

Princess Elizabeth is not used to this sort of thing Shes
further appalled by the loud gurgling of a toilet being flushed
and startled by the entrance of - LIONEL LOGUE Hes in his
forties tall with piercing eyes and charismatic features His
demeanor is friendly but professional The accent although
Australian is not heavy he is after all a speech therapist
TKSSeidler091708 7

LIONEL (CONTD)
How poor are they that have not patience
What wound did ever heal but by degrees

ELIZABETH

LIONEL
Iagoworlds greatest villain Just wants

LIONEL
Thats not a promising start

ELIZABETH
My husbands seen everyone They were all
useless Hes given up hope

LIONEL
A bit premature

ELIZABETH
Because he hasnt seen you

Lionel doesnt disgree

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
Youre very sure of yourself

LIONEL
Im sure of anyone who wants to be cured

ELIZABETH
Of course my husband wants to be cured His
position requires public speaking upon
occasion A torment I fear the requirement
may grow more frequent

LIONEL
He should change jobs
TKSSeidler091708

ELIZABETH
He cant

LIONEL
Indentured servitude

ELIZABETH
Something of that nature

LIONEL
Well have your “hubby pop by and give his
personal history Ill make a frank
appraisal

ELIZABETH
Doctor
Logue tries to object but she over-rides

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
I do not have a hubby We never talk
about our private lives Nor do we “pop
You must come to us

LIONEL
Sorry this is my game played on my turf
by my rules

The lady lifts her veil

ELIZABETH
Perhaps youll make an exception

He recognizes her instantly and is clearly impressed yet
refuses to be intimidated

LIONEL
I thought the appointment was for
Johnson

ELIZABETH
A name used during the Great War when the
Navy didnt wish the enemy to know His
Royal Highness was aboard

LIONEL
Im considered the enemy

ELIZABETH
You will be should you continue to be un-
obliging
TKSSeidler091708

LIONEL
For my method to succeed there must be
mutual trust complete honesty and total
equality That process takes place in my
consultation room No exceptions

ELIZABETH
In which case
(re-lowering her veil)
I should have kept my pledge I promised my
husband Id stop seeking The Great Cure
Ive wasted your time And mine

She exits closing the door firmly behind her
LIONEL
Bloody hell I buggered that

WACK The sound of something solid meeting leather

11 EXT SOUTH KENSINGTON STREET - LATE AFTERNOON 11

penguin The girls giggle but are undeterred

LILIBET

BERTIE
Ah well

Called upon to perform the stutter returns slightly But the
two girls listen raptly ignoring their fathers minor
impediment and it fades

BERTIE (CONTD)
Once upon a time there were two horsies A
white horse that went clip clop clip clop
through Hyde Park And a black horse that
went clip clop clip clop through Hyde Park
They met in the middle of Hyde Park The
white horse said neigh The black horse

Someone pushes through a gap Its Lionel

LIONEL

Now

Falters begins again
TKSSeidler091708

LIONEL (CONTD)
Now is the winter of our discontent
Made glorious summer by this sun of
York

His elocution is crisp and flawless His acting however
unconvincing

LIONEL (CONTD)
And all the clouds that lourd upon our
house
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried
Now are our brows bound with victorious
wreaths

DIRECTOR
(interrupts crisply)
Thank you Beautiful dictionbut I dont

hear the cries of a deformed creature
yearning to be King

Lionel struggles to maintain a semblance of dignity

LIONEL
What do you suggest

DIRECTOR
Continue to do whatever you do and hope it

gives you a great deal of satisfaction

Crushed Lionel retreats behind the curtain

On the parade ground Grenadier Guards in red coats and black

17 INT THE KINGS STUDY BUCKINGHAM PALACE - EVENING

The Kings study resembles a naval captains cabin Both men
are uniformed for a state occasion Bertie regards the BBC
microphone as though it were an alien

TKSSeidler091708 15

BERTIE
I d-d-dont thu-thu-think I c-c-can

In the presence of his father Berties stuttering returns in
full form his breathing short and shallow the muscles in
spasms

KING GEORGE V
Show whos in command If you dont this
devilish device will change everything
Used to be all a King had to do was look
reasonable in uniform and not fall off his
horse Now we must creep cap in hand into
peoples homes that smell of boiled
cabbage and speak nicely to them Were
reduced to that lowest basest of all
creaturesweve becomeactors Dont
give me a look of defeated pathos This is
a family crisis

BERTIE
Father were not a family were a firm

His father shoots Bertie a surprised look Does the lad have a
brain after all

KING GEORGE V
Were the oldest most successful
corporation in the world and sitting on
thrones is our business But any moment now
we may be out of work Your brother came to
me the other day livid a certain lady has
been refused an invitation to my Silver
Jubilee I pointed out she wasnt a lady
and most definitely wasnt his wife

BERTIE
What did David say

KING GEORGE V
She made him sublimely happy I said that

was probably because she was sleeping with
him I give you my word weve never had
immoral relations As my son as Prince
of Wales as my heir do you solemnly swear
your friendship with this woman is an
absolutely clean one I do he said
Look me in the eye I said On my
honour he said Stared straight at his
father and lied

A red light attached to the mike begins a series of warning
blinks

BERTIE
Whatre you going to say

KING GEORGE V
The usual guff The Archbishop writes it
My people love to hear me say it Spoken
fluently of course

Theyre interrupted by the entrance of the BBC News Reader and
Technicians

KING GEORGE V (CONTD)
Thats the chap who taught me how to use
this contraption You touch your chin with
your thumb and the ‘thing with the end of
your little finger Splendid fellow

SQUISH Assisted by the Technicians the News Reader sprays his
throat

BBC NEWS READER
Good evening ladies and gentlemen this is
the BBC broadcasting direct from
Buckingham Palace upon the occasion of the
Royal Silver Jubilee His Majesty King
George the Fifth

KING GEORGE V

(to the mike)
I can only say to you my very very dear
people that the Queen and I thank you from
the depths of our hearts for all the
loyalty and - may I say so - the love with
which this day and always you have
surrounded us I dedicate myself anew to
your service for all the years that may
still be given to me

The News Reader terribly moved whispers to his Technicians

TKSSeidler091708

BBC NEWS READER
Thats how a King speaks

modesty)
I showed HM how to do it

EXT BUCKINGHAM PALACE - NIGHT

The edge of the crowd is visible One can sense a vast sea of
humanity When the glass doors of the upper balcony open the

murmur becomes a ROAR When the King steps out it becomes
tumultuous

EXT BALCONY BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CONTINUOUS

The King is joined by Queen Mary and the Archbishop of
Canterbury other Royals and dignitaries The noise is
deafening The King beckons impatiently for someone still
inside to join them Its Bertie with Elizabeth

Wheres David

KING GEORGE V

(aside to Elizabeth)
Youll have to do a lot more of this Im

The King goes back to waving Elizabeth is stunned at the
prospect

The ROAR of the crowd segues into the ROAR of machinery

INT MIDLAND FACTORY - NEW DAY

Huge industrial wheels whir in neutral WORKERS are lined up
dutifully to hear the visiting Royal Berties lips move but
with the noise he cannot be heard Elizabeth watches in relief

Then a FOREMAN trying to be helpful signals The machinery
halts the factory falls silent
TKSSeidler091708 18

At first the momentum of speaking without being heard carries
Bertie forward

BERTIE
Whats needed is cooperation

Hearing his own voice reverberate through the cavernous factory
brings Berties stutter back in full form

BERTIE (CONTD)
buh-buh-between the cuh-cuh-classses

One of the workers sullenly pulls a chain releasing a blast
from a steam whistle that drowns Bertie out

EXT AUSTIN PRINCESS DRIVING THRU HYDE PARK - NEW DAY 21

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
Neglects to tell them what must be done
how its to be done and whos to do it

BERTIE
David has “the touch They adore him

Oh dear perhaps hes a Bolshevik

BERTIE

Im not sure I want to see this fellow

ELIZABETH

Im not sure he wants to see you

The consultation room door opens and a working class young woman
- ANNA - comes out then realizes with a gasp who they are
retreats rapidly back into the consulting room

ELIZABETH (CONTD)

Perhaps this was a mistake

She

After an uncomfortable moment Anna returns attempting to be

properly formal

and stutters

ANNA

BERTIE

TKSSeidler091708 21

BERTIE

LIONEL

BERTIE

Youre too close Five paces is the rule of
thumb

LIONEL
That might be difficult in this office

Bertie perches uneasily on the edge of an armchair
LIONEL (CONTD)
Nice girl Anna Worried she wouldnt find
a husband if she couldnt speak Tried to
convince her men will find her even more

attractive as a silent partner The perfect

woman Sorry bad Australian joke Whyd
your wife change her mind and ask for an
appointment

BERTIE
I cant discuss that

LIONEL
What can we talk about

BERTIE
Thats better When speaking with a Royal
one waits for the Royal to start the
conversation and chose the topic

LIONEL
Your joking That wont work here

BERTIE
I admit if one waits for me to start a
conversation one can wait a rather long
time

Silence They stare at each other

BERTIE (CONTD)
You call this making me comfortable

LIONEL
You call this being forthcoming

BERTIE
Arent you interested in treating me
TKSSeidler091708

LIONEL
Only if youre interested in being cured

More silence

LIONEL (CONTD)
Cuppa tea

BERTIE
No thank you

LIONEL

for

BERTIE
Apparently a great deal of rudeness Doctor
Logue

LIONEL

Call me Lionel

BERTIE

LIONEL
I prefer Lionel My family calls me far
worse What shall I call you

BERTIE
The Duke of York is appropriate

LIONEL

LIONEL
Much more informal

BERTIE
Prince Albert Or Frederick Arthur
George Ive lots of names to choose from

LIONEL
How about Bertie
TKSSeidler091708

BERTIE
(flushes)
Only my family uses that

LIONEL
Thats what Ill call you then We must be
true equals
BERTIE
If we were equal I wouldnt be here Id be
at home with my family and no-one would
give a damn

Bertie starts to light a cigarette from a silver case

LIONEL
Dont do that

Bertie gives him an astonished look

LIONEL (CONTD)
Sucking smoke into your lungs will kill
you

BERTIE
My physicians say its good for stuttering
relaxes the throat

LIONEL
Theyre idiots

BERTIE
Theyve all been knighted

LIONEL

TKSSeidler091708

BERTIE

intensity)

One of my numerous faults

LIONEL

One of my many faults How about when you

LIONEL
Come on everyone natters to themselves

BERTIE

LIONEL

BERTIE (CONTD)
Must I pay for this

LIONEL
Loads Now when you talk to yourself do

TKSSeidler091708 25

BERTIE
Of course not
LIONEL
Proving your impediment isnt a permanent
internal fixture

BERTIE
When I give a speechI bloody stutter

LIONEL
Bet you a bob you can read flawlessly
right here right now

BERTIE
(bitterly)
Easy money Youre on

LIONEL
See your shilling then

BERTIE
Royals dont carry money

LIONEL
How convenient

Logue fishes a coin from his pocket and puts it on the table

LIONEL (CONTD)
Ill stake you Pay me back next time

BERTIE
If there is a next time

LIONEL
Correct I havent agreed to take you on

During this Logue has uncovered a piece of apparatus a
recording device with earphones He sets a blank disc onto the
turntable and positions a microphone then hands Bertie an open
book Bertie glares at it defiantly

BERTIE
I certainly cant read The Bard

LIONEL
“Easy money

Bertie reads stuttering badly and getting worse

BERTIE
To be or not to be That is the question
Whether it is wiser There
TKSSeidler091708 26

Reaches for the coin

LIONEL
Not so fast

BERTIE
I proved I cant read

LIONEL
You proved you cant listen

Hands Bertie a pair of heavily padded earphones Bertie doesnt
want to take them

LIONEL (CONTD)
A princely bob is at stake

Bertie reluctantly puts on the earphones Logue turns a dial
LOUD MUSIC is heard Bertie takes off the earphones The music
stops

BERTIE
Youre playing music

LIONEL
Im aware

BERTIE
How can I hear what Im saying

LIONEL
Bertie youre Royal Surely a princes
brain knows what its mouth is doing

BERTIE
Youre not well acquainted with Royal
princes are you

LIONEL

I want to demonstrate that when you cant
hear your voice you dont stutter thus
proving your impediment is not innate

BERTIE
Rubbish

Bertie replaces the earphones Again the LOUD MUSIC His lips
move as he reads but all that can be heard is the music
Finished reading the passage he takes off the earphones and the
music ceases He reaches for the coin but Logue snatches it

BERTIE (CONTD)
I was terrible
TKSSeidler091708 27

LIONEL
Flawless

BERTIE
I know how I sound

LIONEL
Would I lie to a prince of the realm to win
twelve-pence

BERTIE
Ive no idea what an Australian might do
for that sort of money

Logue puts the record in a brown paper dust jacket and hands it
to Bertie

LIONEL
Souvenir of our first and presumably last
encounter

Bertie glances at the record

LIONEL

MYRTLE (0S)

BERTIE
Apologies Mrs Logue

LIONEL
First time Ive heard you laugh

BERTIE
Royals arent allowed emotions in public

LIONEL
Which explains a lot

Bertie is in no mood to be provoked
TKSSeidler091708 58

BERTIE
What do you want me to do dammit Stage
my next public appearance as an obscene
operetta

LIONEL
Your next public appearance should be very
well rehearsed

Without thinking Lionel instinctively reaches out to pat Bertie
supportively on the shoulder

Bertie pulls back in offended shock All the warning signals
instilled in him are going off

BERTIE
Dont take liberties Youre a dangerous
man Logue Who sent you

LIONEL
Anyone in mind

BERTIE
The lurking shadows Courtiers and
peersthe whole panoply of a class which
once ruled the nation which once ruled the
world afraid of losing their last vestige
of privilege if the monarchy is further
debased

LIONEL
Your wife was the one who sought me out

BERTIE
Because dear sweet deluded woman she
believes in me

LIONEL
But you dont share her belief Why come
here

BERTIE

Im beginning to ask myself that very same
question Your sailing close to the edge
dont push me Doctor Logue

LIONEL
Lionel

BERTIE
I came here because I was taught from
childhood to serve a purpose and that
purpose is to serve Duty is our sole
justification for privilege
(MORE )
TKSSeidler091708 59

BERTIE (CONTD)
I came here because I was under the
illusion you might help me perform that

function

LIONEL
Not to worry They say the King can do no
wrong

BERTIE

He can bugger things up And I am not the
King Mrs Simpson is seeking a divorce
The Coronation is set for the 12th of May
Her decree becomes final on the 27th of
April That gives them two weeks to marry
and put this issue to rest

LIONEL
And if Mr Baldwin stops them

BERTIE
That would be a tragedy I pray to The
Almighty they succeed Ill do anything
within my power to keep my brother on the
throne

LIONEL
Does that include debasing yourself

BERTIE
If necessary

LIONEL
Your brother knew perfectly well by giving
you a document without warning

BERTIE
Are you saying he wanted me to fail

LIONEL
Are you insisting he didnt In the future
we can parse any document into manageable
phrases You can sing them swear them
rehearse them til you get the rhythm and
flow that combined with your growing
confidence

Bertie doesnt want to hear

BERTIE
Growing confidence Growing dread Youre
a wicked man Lionel Logue trying to get
me to thrust myself forward as an
alternative to my brother Trying to get me
to commit treason
TKSSeidler091708

LIONEL
Trying to get you to realize you need not
be governed by fear Again why did you
seek me out To take polite elocution
lessons so you could attend posh tea
parties

BERTIE
How dare you Im the brother of a
Kingthe son of a Kingback through
untold centuries You presume to instruct
me on my duty A jumped-up jackeroo from
the outback The disappointing son of an
embittered clerk Youre a monster Doctor

WINSTON CHURCHILL
Has it occurred to you as it has only
occurred to me that a Monarch with a gland
problem who realizes he cannot produce

bring his nation to the brink of civil war
just as we face global conflict

I doubt England is ready to return to

What has my brother given up on his

They look at each other unsure

Wouldnt it be a good idea to find out
before coming to me He cannot be Mister
as he was born the son of a Duke Which
makes him a Lord at the very least

WINSTON CHURCHILL
Very well Lord EW it is

BERTIE
And as a Lord of the realm hes entitled
to be elected to the House of Commons
Heading a Kings Party

COSMO LANG
Unacceptable

BERTIE
So you prefer he takes a seat in the House
of Lords Again on behalf of a Kings
Party Is that acceptable

WINSTON CHURCHILL
Certainly not

BERTIE
But if hes made a Royal Duke and called
His Royal Highness he cannot stand for
Parliament Nor may he speak or vote in the

Urged by Bertie Logue opens the door

IN THE PARLOUR Logue enters pretending total innocence and
surprise followed by Bertie also trying to keep the pretense
TKSSeidler091708 85

LIONEL
Oh Hello Lady Elizabeth Oh Hello
Myrtle darling What a pleasant surprise

Myrtle stares at him and takes her revenge

MYRTLE
Will the Yorks be staying for dinner

Logue and Bertie look panic-stricken Elizabeth comes to the
rescue

ELIZABETH
A previous engagement

LIONEL
Some other time love

Logue ushers Elizabeth into the study giving Myrtle a nervous
little wave She glares and exits

IN THE STUDY

LIONEL (CONTD)
Glad you had a chance to meet Myrtle

Bertie stifles a snort Elizabeth glares at him

LIONEL (CONTD)
(to Elizabeth)
Good of you to come

ELIZABETH
Harley Street is far too public What is my
function here

LIONEL

For me to show you how to pitch in

ELIZABETH

Oh dear I may not be a “pitch in type

LIONEL
Piece of cake
(to Bertie)

Please assume a supine position on the

floor

ELIZABETH

Firm support is needed
TKSSeidler091708

Bertie dutifully lies on the floor

LIONEL (CONTD)

ELIZABETH

Bertie springs to his feet while Logue opens a window
TKSSeidler091708

LIONEL
You will now shout the vowel sounds all
five of them as loudly as possible each
to last no less than 15 seconds Theres
poor coordination between your larynx and
diaphragm Princess Elizabeth you can be
the official timer

ELIZABETH
Vowel sounds Shouted at an open window On
a public street

LIONEL
Anyone who can stand at an open window
vibrating loudly in full view of the world
can learn to give a public speech

ELIZABETH
They can also be considered quite dotty
Dont even contemplate it

MYRTLE

LIONEL
When that poor chap first walked into my
office he was a slim quiet man with tired
eyes and all the outward symptoms of the
person upon whom a habitual speech defect
has set the sign You saw him today once
more there was hope

MYRTLE
Youre not listening to me

She gets up angrily and starts carrying dishes to the kitchen
He follows her back and forth
Hes silent

LIONEL
Myrtle I love you

MYRTLE
You say that but you dont listen when I
say in so many ways how desperately I
want to go home how I never ever
intended to stay here This was to be a
holiday trip to see ‘Mother England and
you turned it into quite something else
What happened Lionel We went to Wembley

hubby treating a personage that high and
mighty you wont be needing employment
with us will you Mrs Logue

LIONEL
(anguished)

MYRTLE
Theyre frightened Lionel Of what seems
so far above them I sympathize Im

frightened too

Establishing shot of this architectural icon
COSMO LANG (0S)
Winston you do read the newspapers

81 INT WESTMINSTER ABBEY - DAY 81
A massive cavern of stone statuary and stained glass The
center piece of this particular section is the throne of Edward
the Confessor Scaffolding is in the process of being erected
to supply lighting for the Coronation Archbishop Lang and
Churchill inspect it with satisfaction

WINSTON CHURCHILL
Only the vulgar ones
Churchill pours two nips of whiskey into metal cups nested in a
hip flask
WINSTON CHURCHILL (CONTD)
To our new King
COSMO LANG
Lets sincerely hope
They look at each other in silence
WINSTON CHURCHILL
Is this a ‘slightly pregnant pause
TKSSeidler091708 91

COSMO LANG
They say he is dim

WINSTON CHURCHILL
Demonstrably untrue

COSMO LANG
They say he has epilepsy

WINSTON CHURCHILL
Patently erroneous
COSMO LANG
Fragile prone to illness

WINSTON CHURCHILL
Some correctness in that

COSMO LANG
and will die prematurely They predict
hell be unable to complete the Coronation

WINSTON CHURCHILL
What do you propose Shorten the ceremony
Or no ceremony at all

COSMO LANG
My idea exactly

WINSTON CHURCHILL
I believed so But what we need is a
pageant of pomp and pomposity to impress
the world

COSMO LANG
What we need and what well get may be
two rather different things Did you hear
his pathetic attempt at the Accession
Council Hell never be able to speak in
public

WINSTON CHURCHILL
So we plonk a tinsel crown on his head and
lock him in a closet Who then will
spiritually lead this great nation into
war Who will address the far flung corners
of the Empire rallying all to our defense

COSMO LANG
Well

WINSTON CHURCHILL
The Head of our Church Is that what you
have in mind

TKSSeidler091708

COSMO LANG
Would it be such a calamity

WINSTON CHURCHILL
Best ask our new King

Bertie has entered with Logue Lang spins around

COSMO LANG

Your Majesty

WINSTON CHURCHILL

Excuse me sir duty calls

He exits quickly Cosmo continues nervously as they walk

through the Abbey

the Archbishop pointing out the preparations

in progress particularly a booth for broadcasters

BERTIE

Is this the scene of the crime

COSMO LANG

What a peculiar thing to say

BERTIE

Referring to my assault upon the ears of
the listeners

COSMO LANG

Ah yes wireless is indeed a Pandoras
Box I have however categorically said no
to the BBCs new radio-with-pictures

gadget

Imagine the unwashed viewing us as

we blow our noses or scratch our bottoms

BERTIE

Radio with pictures

COSMO LANG

It is calledtelevision Happily with
a transmission range of only fifteen miles
this TV thing has no future We shall
however be forced to permit cinema the
product of which I shall personally edit

BERTIE

Thatll keep you busy removing all my
stops and starts

COSMO LANG
Unless of course youd prefer a quiet
ceremony
TKSSeidler091708 93

BERTIE

What exactly do you mean
COSMO LANG
Somethingdiscreetprivate We could
pre-record an edited version to be
broadcast to the world Or even find an
actor with a similar voice

Logue has arrived and comes out of the shadows

LIONEL
A King based upon deception

Cosmo takes Bertie aside

COSMO LANG
If your gentleman from Security would give
us space we could discuss this in private

BERTIE
You mean my bodyguard Crusher

Giving Lionel a scathing look Lang continues speaking to Bertie
confidentially

COSMO LANG
Fret not As I assured our nation in my
recent broadcast When his people listen
to their new Monarch they will note an
occasional momentary hesitation in his
speech But to those who hear it it need
cause no sort of embarrassment for it
causes none to him who speaks You see
Ive paved the way But should you wish to
avoid further stress

LIONEL
Why not paint him pink and cover him with
sequins

COSMO LANG
Pardon

LIONEL
If you wish to call attention to his
anxiety

COSMO LANG

Does your bodyguard know to whom hes
speaking He certainly doesnt know his
place

TKSSeidler091708 94
BERTIE
Doctor Lionel Logue my speech therapist

COSMO LANG
Therapist Id no idea Had I known Your
Majesty was seeking assistance I wouldve
made my own recommendation

BERTIE
Dr Logue is to be present at the
Coronation

COSMO LANG
Impossibly to find room Even for a Doctor

LIONEL
Just Lionel

BERTIE
Behind the chair of Edward the Confessor

COSMO LANG
The Royal Box Your Family will be seated
there

BERTIE
Which makes it most suitable

COSMO LANG
Perhaps I might be able to add a very small
stool

BERTIE

wo comfortable chairs One for Madam
Logue Shes a close friend of my wife The
Queen

fq

COSMO LANG
ll have someone attend to it

LIONEL
And now if you dont mind we need the
premises

COSMO LANG
My dear fellow this is Westminster Abbey
The Church must make preparations

LIONEL
So must Bertie

COSMO LANG
Bertie We do not call the King Bertie
TKSSeidler091708

LIONEL
I do During waking hours well need the
facilities Itll be a closed set No
observers

BERTIE
Those are my wishes Your Grace

Lang nods curtly and exits

BERTIE (CONTD)
Youve made a dangerous enemy

LIONEL
Wouldnt want him as a friend

BERTIE
And dont ever call me Bertie in public

A moment of confrontation Lionel knows hes overstepped

LIONEL
Tell me

BERTIE
I sense one of your dreadful questions on
the horizon

LIONEL
Do you really want to be King

BERTIE
Knew it I havent any choice

LIONEL
You can be a wounded King who stumbles
through his Coronation Or as the Arch of
C so archly suggests no Coronation at all
Always a choice

BERTIE
Whats this you wait til Westminster
Abbey then ambush me

LIONEL
Im simply asking questions which you
seem unable to answer

BERTIE

Im a sacrificial lamb being led to

slaughter Damn you
TKSSeidler091708

LIONEL

Quite possibly But at least I know what I

want You havent the

As soon as you and Elizabeth enter the West
door youll be greeted with the hymn I

Bertie follows Logue deep into the

bowels of the “Abbey

LIONEL (CONTD)
Youll then show yourself to the various
sides of the Abbey as the Archbishop
announces four times in a loud voice
Sirs I here present unto you Have you
decided your name for when you become King
For when you become a different person

BERTIE

He gives a final satisfied look at the cavernous space like a
director preparing the stage for a final scene He quotes
Shakespeare extremely pleased with himself

The plays the thing wherein Ill catch

the conscience of a King
He exits
THE CAMERA explores various elements
The Throne of Edward the Confessor

Beneath it a large rough-hewn stone The Stone Of Scone

Leaning against the Throne a huge sword set there for the next
Coronation rehearsal

Majestic stained glass windows of saints kings and martyrs
Rows of pews worn with centuries of use

Graves of the mighty kings poets and statesmen

This Abbey holds the history of a nation

Footsteps resonate
Lionel enters Trips over one of the gravestones

Lights snap on skewering Lionel Bertie steps into view wearing
a coat against the night chill of the stone cathedral

BERTIE
This is not a rehearsal Doctor Logue
TKSSeidler091708 99

LIONEL
Ah the Star Chamber inquisition I
wondered when that would happen And Id
promised Myrtle a new frock

BERTIE
(barely controlled)
Just call me Lionel Never did you call
yourself Doctor We did that for you No
diploma no training no credentials Just
a great deal of nerve

LIONEL
Want to hear my side of the story

BERTIE
There isnt a your-side-of-the-story
This is my story And youve ruined it Its
not just the Coronation terrifying enough
its the radio speech to millions
afterwards and the speech after that and
for the rest of my failed miserable life

LIONEL
(softly)
Wembley Stadium

BERTIE
You dare remind me

LIONEL
I was there

BERTIE

Then you knew from the start I was
hopeless
LIONEL
My son Valentine asked Could you help
that poor man I replied Hes too old
for me to manage a complete cure but I
could very nearly do it Im sure of that

BERTIE
Lying bastard

LIONEL
I knew I could help you You refuse to
believe

BERTIE
In you
TKSSeidler091708 100

LIONEL
In yourself

BERTIE
Who the hell do you think you are

LIONEL
A failed actor

BERTIE
Actor

LIONEL
Father wanted me to be a doctor but I
couldnt cut flesh So I worked in the
mines recited in pubs

BERTIE
An actor

LIONEL
When the war came by the time I was ready
to be shipped out the first casualties
were limping home Poor buggers broken in
bone and spirit “Lionel youre good with
your mouth see if you can help these poor
sods The shell-shocked were the saddest
Most stuttered profoundly Far worse than
you Muscle therapy helped somewhat but I
found I had to go deeper as you might well
imagine

BERTIE
I know nothing of those poor men
LIONEL
I think you do They had cried out and the
universe had not listened So theyd lost
faith in their voice My job was to make
them shout in righteous anger I have the
right to be heard

BERTIE
I suppose that helped them did it

LIONEL
Make inquiries

BERTIE
Inquiries have been made No credentials

LIONEL
But a lot of success No training was
given
(MORE)
TKSSeidler091708 101

LIONEL (CONTD)
Not in Western Australia not at that time
I simply knew what to do When the war was
over I kept being a therapist to earn a
living When the lads were old enough I
thought Alright Lionel youve always
wanted to be an actor one last go I
pretended it was our trip home to Mother
England the Great Australian Pilgrimage

BERTIE
To Harley Street

LIONEL
Cashed in our return tickets I had three
months rent

BERTIE
So you set yourself up on Harley Street as
an actor Harley Street dont you know is
for doctors

LIONEL
The plaque says “L Logue Speech
Specialist No mention of a medical
degree No mention of any degree Some of
the diggers Id helped had come to England
They made referrals My practice
flourished My acting however did not
BERTIE
Well enough to deceive me

LIONEL
Lock me in the Tower

BERTIE
I would if I could

LIONEL
What crime

BERTIE
Youve saddled this nation in its moment of
peril with a voiceless King Destroyed the
happiness of my familyall for the sake
of ensnaring a star client you knew you
couldnt possibly assist

Lionel sits down on the chair of Edward the Confessor Leaning
against it is the great two-handed sword of St George

BERTIE (CONTD)
Whatre you doing Get up
TKSSeidler091708 102

LIONEL
Im tired

BERTIE
You cant sit there

LIONEL
Why not Its a chair

BERTIE
Its the Chair of Edward The Confessor The
throne upon which every King for six anda
half centuries has been crowned

LIONEL
Its falling apart People have carved
their initials into it Needs a stone to
keep from blowing away

BERTIE
Thats the Stone of Scone The Stone of
Destiny that was once Jacobs pillow

LIONEL
You believe such ballocks I dont care how
many royal backsides have sat on it its a
building block with handles attached
Youre just like me an actor with tawdry
stage props you choose to believe are real

BERTIE
Listen to me

LIONEL
Listen to you By what right

BERTIE
Divine right if you must Im your King

LIONEL
Noooo youre not Told me so yourself Said
you didnt want it So why should I listen
to a poor stuttering bloke who cant put
one word after another Why waste my time
listening to you

Because I have a right to be heard

LIONEL
Heard as what

Well thenyoure cured

Stop trying to squirm off the hook

you know it
Bertie stares at him

A familiar voice is heard from the shadows

Your Majesty

The Archbishop of Canterbury
COSMO LANG
Youll be relieved to learn Ive found a
replacement specialist Impeccable
credentials

Theres a long silence

BERTIE
That wont be necessary

COSMO LANG
The matters already been settled For your
own well-being

BERTIE
What did you say

COSMO LANG
Your Majestys function is to consultand
to be advised You didnt consult but
youve just been advised

BERTIE
Now I advise you so listen carefully
in this personal matter I will make my
own decision

COSMO LANG
May I remind you you do not place the
crown upon your own head

BERTIE
And may I remind you it is my head upon
which the crown is placed
TKSSeidler091708 104

COSMO LANG
This will end badly

Lang turns on his heel
Lionel ignores what has just happened

LIONEL
In hushed tones the BBC commentator paints
a picture for the world as you stand at
the altar divested of your robes Trumpets
echo through the Abbey The incessant rain
clears miraculously as a shaft of sun
streams through the stained-glass window

catching your golden tunic and bathing you
in light like a mediaeval knight And you
are King

Churchill and Lang can be heard

COSMO LANG (0S)

WINSTON CHURCHILL (0S)
There were tears in my eyes too Your
Grace particularly when I saw you and the
Dean of Westminster cannoning into each
other

COSMO LANG (0S)

More tears when our new Monarch started
towards his throne only to be brought to
an abrupt halt owing to one of the Bishops
treading on his robe

David and Wallis visiting the Fuhrer in Germany Hitler
gallantly kissing Mrs Simpsons hand while Goring and the Duke
of Windsor beam David giving the Nazi salute FREEZE FRAME
The lights come on For once Churchill is speechless
COSMO LANG (CONTD)
Theres no doubt David is planning a
comeback And will succeed if our King
continues to falter Though Bertie
miraculously survived the Coronation he
continues to stumble very badly indeed
Soon he must broadcast to the world Hitler
will be listening David will be listening
Stalin and Roosevelt will be listening
Everyone will be listening God help us

Turn the halts into pauses during which
you say to yourself God save the King

I say that all the time but apparently no
ones listening

LIONEL
Use the silence Long pauses add solemnity
to great occasions

BERTIE
Then Im the solemnest king who ever lived
Lionel I cant do this

Logue tries to protest Bertie over-rides

If I am to be Kingwhere is my power May
I form a Government on my own appoint or
dismiss a Prime Minister chose an
Ambassador levy a tax or declare a war
None of these things Yet I am the seat of
all authority Why Because the Nation
believes when I speak I speak for them
Yet I cannot speak

(then)
One final question

BERTIE

LIONEL

A very long pause

BERTIE
Almost

The red light on the microphone starts to blink Logue joins
the others

The Reader is at a smaller microphone near the ad hoc “broadcast
booth Five four three two

BBC NEWS READER
Good evening this is the BBC National and
World programme broadcasting from
Buckingham Palace His Majesty the King

During this Berties hands begin to shake the pages of his
speech rattle like dry leaves his throat muscles constrict the
Adams apple bulges his lips tightenall the old symptoms
reappear

Several seconds have elapsed since the Reader finished It
seems an eternity

Elizabeth grasps the sides of her chair with white knuckles
Langs eyes roll heavenward
Churchill studies the situation ready to leap into the breach
Bertie and Logue stare at each other

Logue smiles perfectly calm totally confident in the man hes
worked with His confidence is contagious

Bertie takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly His hands
grow steady his throat muscles relaxall the things hes

practiced

88 INT LOGUES PARLOUR - NIGHT 88
The luminous dial of a wireless Unbearable silence Then

BERTIE (VO RADIO FILTER)
In this grave hour perhaps the most
fateful in our history I send to every
household of my peoples both at home and
overseas

This is being listened to by Myrtle and the boys The boys look
at their mum Suddenly they explode with cheers as the radio
address continues

89 INT EXT MONTAGE OF VARIOUS LOCATIONS IN ENGLAND AND AROUND 89
THE
WORLD - NIGHT OR DAY DEPENDING ON LOCATION

In homes pubs (where we see the man with the rosacea nose)
clubs hotels boarding houses factories mines prisons a
shearing shed in New Zealand cattle station in Australia sites
in India South Africa loci around the Commonwealth and Empire
China Japan The Kremlin The White House Hitlers mountain
top wolf den The South of France (where David and Wallis listen
dolefully)

During this the address continues with dramatic pauses to be
sure but no real hesitations

BERTIE (VO ON RADIO)
this message spoken with the same depth
of feeling for each one of you as if I were
able to cross your threshold and speak to
you myself For the second time in the
lives of most of us we are at war For we

are called with our allies to meet the
challenge of a principle which if it were
to prevail would be fatal to any civilized
order in the world It is the principle
which permits a State in the selfish
pursuit of power to disregard its treaties
and its solemn pledges which sanctions the
use of force or threat of force against
the sovereignty and independence of other
States Such a principle stripped of all
disguise is surely the mere primitive
doctrine that might is right and if this
principle were established throughout the
world the freedom of our own country and
of the whole British Commonwealth of
Nations would be in danger

BERTIE (VO ON RADIO) (CONTD)
But far more than this - the peoples of the
world would be kept in the bondage of fear
and all hopes of settled peace and of the
security of justice and liberty among
nations would be ended This is the
ultimate issue which confronts us

End the montage with a return to the exterior of Buckingham

Palace

Outside stand solemn crowds listening to the speech

on loudspeakers PAN THEIR FACES the faces of England
stalwart and resolved

INT

BERTIE (CONTD)
For the sake of all that we ourselves hold
dear and of the worlds order and peace
it is unthinkable that we should refuse to
meet the challenge It is to this high
purpose that I now call my people at home
and my peoples across the seas who will
make our cause their own I ask them to
stand calm firm and united in this time
of trial The task will be hard There may
be dark days ahead and war can no longer
be confined to the battlefield But we can
only do the right as we see the right and
reverently commit our cause to God

THE PRINCESSES PLAYROOM - NIGHT

The two girls listen to their father on the radio

BERTIE (VO ON RADIO)
If one and all we keep resolutely faithful
to it ready for whatever service or
sacrifice it may demand then with Gods
help we shall prevail

Lilibets expression tells it all - she can hear it her father

is truly King

91 INT KINGS STUDYBROADCAST ROOM BUCKINGHAM PALACE -
CONTINUOUS

Bertie in his quiet way is totally in command and utterly
magnificent Everyone in the room is awed as he concludes
TKSSeidler091708 114

BERTIE (CONTD)
We may all find a message of encouragement
in the lines which in my closing words I
would like to say to you “I said to the
man who stood at the Gate of the Year
Give me a light that I may tread safely
into the unknown And he replied Go out
into the darkness and put your hand into
the Hand of God That shall be to you
better than light and safer than a known
way May the Almighty Hand guide and
uphold us all

IN THE AD HOC “CONTROL BOOTH AREA - the Manager makes a “cut
gesture to Bertie hes off the air the red light on the
microphone goes out The Manager points and the red light on
the Readers microphone goes on

BBC NEWS READER
This concludes the BBC broadcast of the
Kings Speech

Another “cut gesture from the Floor Manager the red light goes
out and the transmission is concluded The Floor Manager looks
to the Reader

BBC NEWS READER (CONTD)
(softly)
He wasnt perfect
(barely controlling his
tears)
Not perfect But by God He moved me

AT THE MAIN BBC MICROPHONE - Bertie waits for the verdict of his
peers Churchill first

WINSTON CHURCHILL

She leaves the two men together

LIONEL

you King

He offers his hand But instead of taking it Bertie takes him

by the shoulders and gives him a hug This is a long way from
the five pace rule The last barrier has fallen
