The man nods and looks up finally revealing his face--

HE HAS THE FACE OF A DEMON Skin so blue it appears black --
his eyes are YELLOW dilated and glazed over This is KURT
WAGNER aka NIGHTCRAWLER

The agent quickly reaches for his pistol

But from BEHIND THE AGENT’S HEAD a forked TAIL reaches up

Pyro manipulates the fire with ease creating a series of
marbles that effortlessly flow between his fingers

ROGUE

She reaches to touch Pyro’s hand He flinches away

ROGUE (CONT’D)
It’s okay I can control it better

Bobby watches jealously As Rogue’s hand makes contact with
Pyro’s There a quick FLASH OF LIGHT -- Pyro smiles like he’s
buzzed Rogue pulls her hand away with THE SMALL FLAME

ROGUE (CONT’D)
Wow I feel warm

But she can’t control it and it quickly grows larger
swirling around her hand

KITTY
Rogue be careful

“PYRO
She’s got it

She doesn’t and Bobby knows it She continues wrestling with
the flame when Bobby glances over at THREE TEENAGE BOYS who
are watching them from a few tables over

He blows the smoke into Pyro’s face

TEENAGER 1

Oh yeah Whaddya do with that
Light your farts

The teens laugh He takes another drag from his cigarette
PUSH IN ON THE GLOWING EMBERS of the cigarette

PYRO

Pyros EYES narrow -- and VWOOSH THE FLAME of the cigarette
travels as fast as lightning incinerating the cigarette and
setting the guy’s jacket and hair on fire He SCREAMS
furiously trying to PAT it out His friends panic

BOBBY reaches up his hand ‘and ‘sends a STREAM of FROST’

JEAN GREY
No I don’t think so Scott

XAVIER
While Eric might have organized something
like this from prison - for him the
gesture is far too irrational It only
hurts his goal of mutant prosperity
CYCLOPS
You mean superiority

XAVIER
If Eric had his way yes

IN THE BACKGROUND the TV screen displays images of
PROTESTERS on both sides of the mutant issue

STORM
You know how the government will respond
to this They’ll re-introduce the
Registration Act

XAVIER —
Or worse

Xavier stares at the protesters on TV troubled

JEAN GREY
Do you think the mutant was working
alone

XAVIER

The only way well know is if we find him
before the authorities do

Mr President Thanks for having me

They shake hands

PRESIDENT MCKENNA
I don’t believe you two have met Senator
Kelly this is William Stryker

STRYKER
No weve never metbut I‘ve followed
your career for years It seems that your
ideas about the mutant problem have
changed recently

SENATOR KELLY
For the best I hope

PRESIDENT MCKENNA
Senator Kelly’s been at the forefront of
° both sides of the issue for some time --
(3 I thought his point of view would be
worthwhile particularly during this
crisis

STRYKER
If you think that’s appropriate

SENATOR KELLY
So what are you proposing Mr Stryker

Stryker clearly not comfortable with Kelly’s request begins
to place SURVEILLANCE PHOTOS OF XAVIER’ s HENSTON on the
President ’s desk oS yoaty si

STRYKER

Island terrorists

Eric Eric Lensherr You have access to
him

STRYKER
My group developed the technology that
built his prison when I might add the
Defense Department couldn’t find room in
their budget

He continues to hand the President PHOTOS Senator Kelly
finally looks at the photos His face blanks

SENATOR KELLY
This facility is a school

STRYKER
Sure it is

Stryker throws down a series of black and white photos of THE

in the mansion notwithstanding continue
smoking that in here and you will
spend the rest of your days under the
belief that you are a six year-old girl

REVEAL Logan standing in the entrance behind the Professor
cigar in his mouth

LOGAN
Youd do that

XAVIER
I’‘ll have Jean braid you hair

Logan puts out the cigar with his palm and puts the rest in
his shirt pocket for later

XAVIER (CONTD)
) How was your search More questions than
answers

Logan steps forward onto the platform and the door closes
Xavier puts on the HELMET As Cerebro HUMS to life Logan
looks around sketchy

LOGAN
You want me to leave of

The walls FALL AWAY with the CEREBRO EFFECT

The CEREBRO POV abruptly pulls STRAIGHT DOWN with STOMACH
LURCHING SPEED rushing through BLACKNESS with HINTS OF
LIGHT In seconds both Logan and Xavier are STANDING INSIDE
A GIANT IMAGE OF THE EARTH rotating above them

Dotted across all continents are SPARKLING WHITE AND RED

Suddenly the WHITE LIGHTS FADE -- leaving only the red ones

XAVIER (CONT’D)
And these are the mutants -- many of them
don‘t even realize yet who they are You
see we’re not as alone as you think

LOGAN
I found the base at Alkali Lake there
was nothing there

Xavier’s too focused on the lights which have completely
faded leaving only a RED LINE along the East Coast

XAVIER
Odd This broken line represents the path
of the mutant who attacked the President
Im finding it hard to lock-on to him

LOGAN
Can’t you just increase the signal

XAVIER
If I wanted to kill him yes

Cerebro zooms in closer revealing the a BLINKING RED LIGHT
in BOSTON Latitude and longitude points are displayed

XAVIER (CONTD)
-it looks like he’s finally stopped
running

i

Logan is angry He has no interest in talking about this-

LOGAN
I need you to read my mind again

Xavier closes his eyes -- he has found what he needs
Suddenly the CEREBRO effect COLLAPSES on itself and we’re
back on the catwalk

XAVIER
I’m afraid the results will be the same
as before

LOGAN
We had a deal

unlocked and opened -- it’s a beehive

Have you come back to make sure your hard
earned dollars are keeping me so

Using a small pipette Laurio puts TWO DROPS of the YELLOW
LIQUID on the back of Magneto’s neck -- right on the scar

ANGLE ON THE YELLOW LIQUID as it BUBBLES and proceeds to
sink into Magneto’s neck -- forming a PERFECT CIRCLE

Magneto looks up-- his eyes are wide and dilated just as
Nightcrawler’s were in the White House He seems to be ina

You know I’ve been working with mutants

nobody seems to know how many even
exist or how to find them

extracted from the unfortunate person in front of us
