GRACE

Oh I dont blame you Hugh probably

Connie wants to say something to make up for Hughs slight She
speaks simply saying what she can of the Hugh she actually knew

CONNIE

I know he wasnt always responsible
And sometimes that looked like

thoughtlessness But to me and I
know I knew him such a short time
compared to all of you but to me
there was a kindness about him that
was so much sweeter because it was so
thoughtless He was one of the only
people I ever met who was kind without
a reason not because he wanted

A sunny day
INT CATHEDRAL - MAIN CHAPEL - DAY

Huge intimidating Gothic architecture Stained glass windows and
shafts of rainbow-colored lights falling on the congregation
Father Brian in his vestments speaks beneath the ornate crucifix

Connie stands with the Winterbournes around the baptismal font
She is dressed in expensive black and holding the baby who is
dressed in an antique christening gown

Connie looks pretty good but her hairs still scraggly and she
still wears that Jersey girl make-up Not too garish but
definitely not the classy style of the other women around her -
like that of the two high seciety debutantes CHRISTINE and SUSAN
we see seated nearby

Out of the corner of her eye Connie watches the others go through
the ceremony She hears

ALL
‘I believe in God the Father Almighty
Creator of Heaven and Earth

She watches their lips trying to say what they say which is

ALL
‘This is our faith This is the
faith of the Church We are proud
to profess it in Christ Jesus
our Lord

but from her sounds more like

CONNIE
‘This is our fade This is the fade
of the Churg We are loud to confess
it in Jesus Christ our lob’

and Connie takes him aside nervously babbling as Father Brian

listens befuddled

CONNTE

I had a question Just as fer

fabulous am I supposed to tip you

(he shakes his head confused)
Anyway the thing is if somebody
was to say baptize their baby with
a fake name would the mother just
go to hell or would the baby be in
on that too

(he stares at her blankly)
Im not talking about me This is
for a friend Long story Boy the

She hurries off leaving Father Brian bewildered
and gives the baby a kiss

Bill nods They both watch as Connie is bumped by a passerby and
spills her glass all over the front of her dress She grabs for a
napkin from a nearby table and tips over a small dip bowl The dip
flows in a goopy mass onto the table Connie tries to scoop the
dip back into the bowl hoping no one is looking She accidentally
drops her wine glass into the punch bowl Starts fishing it out

Christine and Bill are looking

INT CHEAP MOTEL - STEVES ROOM - DAY 147

Four dingy walls and an old bed

Steve is trying to set up an old stained playpen - hes standing
in it kicking at the bottom trying to flatten it out He steps

out of it and tosses in some toys - a chewed up teddy bear and a
couple of Leggos

He looks up to see Connie in the window looking in He crosses to
the door to let her in She enters pushing the stroller
looking very out of place in her expensive coat

Steve doesnt spare her a glance - he goes straight to the baby
lifting him out of the stroller

STEVE
Theres the guy Big boy Look at

Connie walks in carefully keeping her back to the wall as she
circles him

Steve carries Hugh to the playpen

He plops the kid down in the middle of playpen and stands back -
the baby starts howling

STEVE (contd)
Whats with him

CONNIE
Hes got taste

Connie goes to Hugh - Steve steps in ahead of her and picks him up-
The baby quiets and looks up at him curious

STEVE
You know this is a very emotional
moment for me Do you know how much
it means to a man to know that his
name is gonna be passed on Thats an
awful lot youre askingme to give up
And for what Have you offered me
anything in return even a kind word
No You just look at me like Im
going to contaminate your precious
baby - like youd even have the little
bastard if it wasnt for me

He sits in the playpen giving the kid a Leggo to chew on

CONNIE
Did you wash that

STEVE
Huh Oh sure

Connie steps into the playpen and takes the Leggo away from him -
Hugh starts bawling again She roots through her purse for
something else to give him

CONNIE
So you got a plan right Lets
hear it

She hands the baby a pacifier He sucks on it happily

STEVE

I tell you what I ought to do I
ought to tell the Winterbournes all
about this nasty little con youre
pulling on ‘em I mean its not
right to let the kid grow up livin
a lie I should let everybody know
who he really is and sue for
custody
WHITE - May 5 1995 page 97
Connie looks back at him

STEVE (cont ‘d)
And dont think I wouldnt get it
Birth fathers are winning cases
like this every day And look at
the character of the mother

He starts tickling the baby

STEVE (contd)
A slut con artist exploiting a
grieving family to get their fortune
(to the baby) —
Mommy would never see you again

The baby giggles Steve leans back against the playpen

STEVE (contd)
But the problem with that is I
still get nothing and I wind up
stuck with a baby and who needs
that

Connie stands up and takes a check out of her purse

CONNIE
Its all filled out Just tell me
the amount

STEVE
(picking a number out of the air)
50000

She hesitates then crosses to the bureau and fills in the
amount and hands him the check

STEVE (contd)
‘Patricia Winterbourne’ Very nice

He steps out of the crib and gets an envelope from the bed table He
puts the check in and seals it He slips the envelope in his pocket

STEVE (contd)

Thanks but thats nowhere near
enough I have a better idea

(off her reaction)
No youll like it Its an idea
where everybody gets what they want

trembling voice belying her attempt to sound tough

more forthcoming

CONNIE
Well Im not exactly Miss Honesty

BILL
I was afraid to tell you because
I thought it might scare you away
Besides I fell in love with you
Not with your name

He looks at her the relief in having this huge secret lifted from

them is beginning to settle in

Its as if they can both take a full

breath for the first time in weeks Connie sighs a eep sigh letting

it all go

CONNIE

IT wanted to tell you so many times

At first I was just afraid But

Hughie wasnt her grandson it would

as casually as she can

CONNIE
So did you kill Steve
BILL
Nope —

He takes her by the arms and looks at her dead serious

BILL (contd)
But if Id known he was trying to
hurt you I might have

He embraces her A comforting embrace She rubs her cheek against
his feeling safe for maybe the first time in her life

rather WEATHERED WOMAN IN HER MID-FORTIES most definitely not in
formal attire who steps out of it and walks up the steps Shes
joined by a nervous young man in an equally cheap suit Together

The woman pulls out a badge with a studied lack of flourish
