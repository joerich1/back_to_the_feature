man

RAYETTE DIPESTO

in a waitresss uniform with a bowl of beer nuts
After placing them on the coffee table in front of

less than reciprocal response she kisses him more
fervently As she moves her lips from his ear to
his neck he lifts the can to his mouth and drinks

WYNETTE (VO)
Stand by your manAnd show the
world you love himKeep giving all
the love you canStand by your

The song concludes and setting aside her ardor for
the moment

As she starts for the stereo he takes hold of her
hand

BOBBY
Youre not going to play it again

RAYETTE

and pulls her down onto the couch

over his ear

immediately lays her body against his

Oh now baby

and initiates another round of kissing

inside

interest and return to their dials and needles

Bobby looks from them through the glass partition

ELIZABETH TITA DUPEA is at the piano intensely
into the Bach She wears a monastic-looking dress
her unruly hair is pinned back from her face and
her glasses lie on the bench beside her

ON BOBBY

ON TITA

She is sounding as she plays in tones out-of-key
and discordant with the Bach

FIRST ENGINEER
There she goes again

Bobby glances over at him then looks back to Tita
POV

She hunches over the keyboard and plays an
arpeggio humming a long monochromatic note

SECOND ENGINEER
My 1l-year-old can carry a tune

Bobby is about to defend her when the engineer
flips a toggle switch and addresses the mike
feeding into the studio

SECOND ENGINEER (CONTD)
Miss Dupea

There is no response and she continues playing

restraining his irritation under the following

SECOND ENGINEER

TITA
Oh Im sorry Was I singing

SECOND ENGINEER
If you want to call it that

TITA
Well you have to simply tell me

She puts her elbows on top of the piano and drops
her head into her bands

As she blows her nose into the tissue a young man
comes into view hands Bobby a paper cup and

CARL

Its still nearly impossible for me
to turn my neck If I wanted to
turn toward Catherine for
instance Id first have to twist
the whole base of my body around
(demonstrating)
like this

Tita gets up from the table and taking her plate
exits to the kitchen And as Carl readjusts himself
in his chair and takes a sip from his wine glass
Bobby looks at Catherine to find her looking at
him She quickly alters her gaze to Carl

CATHERINE
I wouldnt mind doing a little
work if youre finished and not
too tired

CARL
No Im finished
(placing a hand on his
stomach)

Satiety is my father and mother

Finding hes amused himself and nobody else he
gets up and addresses Bobby

CARL (CONTD)
Shes tremendously gifted this
girl

BOBBY
(looking at her)
Is she

Catherine stands up and wanting to change the
subject

CATHERINE
Excuse me I dont want to hear
this

She exits and Carl on his way out pauses at
Bobbys chair

CARL
I hope you feel at home Robert
(patting him on the
shoulder)
Im really glad youre here

BOBBY
Thanks Carl

He looks down table to see Spicer stacking his
plate onto Nicholass and his eyes follow him as
he too moves out of the dining room to the
kitchen

CLOSE ON BOBBY

in extreme discomfort at being left alone with his
father He looks down at his plate poking at the
remainder of his dinner then braves a look down
the table

ON NICHOLAS

looking back at him his eyes devoid of interest or
cognition
EXT DUPEA GROUNDS - DAY

Bobby and Tita walk away from the house down toward
the ocean Accompanying them is a Borzoi hound
belonging to her

TITA
He has ways of communicating
Robert I can tell when hes
expressing approval or disapproval
just from his eyes

BOBBY
Uhm hmm Some range

TITA
Its not that bad

BOBBY
Yes it is I cant take seeing
him sitting there like a stone

TITA
A week or two isnt going to ruin
your life for Godsakes

He doesnt respond

TITA (CONTD)
I mean you think Im that happy

BOBBY
No I dont
(a pause then)
You shouldve left a long time ago

TITA
We cant all get up and leave can
we I mean there are certain needs
you have to respond to

She stops walking and moves to one of the garden
chairs facing out toward the bay

TITA (CONTD)
And anyway I want you to stay so
I can spend some time with you and
ask you some questions

He leans his back against a tree

BOBBY
What questions

TITA
Well do you -- I mean have you
enjoyed all these strange things

youve been doing

BOBBY
Sometimes

She stares at him for a moment and taking note of
it

BOBBY (CONTD)
Why Am I some kind of freak to you
or something

TITA
No no I dont think that Im
just curious about it
(a pause)
Do you think Im a freak

BOBBY
Sort of
She laughs
TITA
Oh no Why What is it The way I
look
BOBBY
No I dont really think youre a
freak
TITA

I probably am but I dont care I
mean I wasnt that blessed to
begin with and when would I have
had time to make any
improvements

BOBBY
What about Carl and Catherine Is
he just coaching her or what

TITA
Constantly Night and day And
unless I get up before the birds I
cant get in any practice time for
myself
BOBBY
Uhm hmm

TITA
Actually its very admirable the
way she works Shell probably be
enormously successful because
shes attractive as well not that
thats so important in music
but

BOBBY
Youre attractive Tita If you
just did a little more with
yourself

TITA
Like what

BOBBY
Well if you just maybe did
something with your hair or

TITA
Oh lets not talk about my hair
it does what it wants to and
anyway who cares I want to talk
about you

BOBBY
Theres nothing to say Tita

He offers nothing further and looks out over the
bay Then after a brief silence

TITA
Well youre not going to run out
on me right away are you

BOBBY
I dont know

INT DUPEA HOME - DAY

Bobby strolls casually about the house - in truth
looking for an opportunity to run into Catherine

He moves to the music room and looks inside

THROUGH THE DOORWAY
Catherine can be seen seated at the piano Carl
stands above her and they engage in some exchange
about the score resting on the pianos music stand
ON BOBBY

as he moves down the hallway and sees

Spicer descending the staircase with the brittle
Nicholas in his arms

He ducks into the nearest room to avoid them
INT DEN - DUPEA HOME - DAY

Tita startled in the act of appraising herself in
a mirror above the fireplace turns around to
Bobby

TITA
Oh God dont sneak up on me like
that

We see she wears a little make-up and has done
something different with her hair

BOBBY
Sorry

He turns and exits the den
EXT DUPEA HOUSE - DAY
Bobby stands on the front porch looking toward

Catherine coming up from the ocean She wears a
bathrobe over a wet bathing suit and carries a
towel and as she approaches

CATHERINE
Hello

BOBBY
I guess you fell in the water

CATHERINE
(amused)
Yes intentionally

BOBBY
Thats dangerous you know
CATHERINE
Swimming

BOBBY
Playing piano all day and then
jumping into cold water You could
get a cramp

She laughs and begins drying her hair with a corner
of the towel

CATHERINE
I love to swim and I dont mind
the cold at all Its invigorating

BOBBY
Well I wouldnt want to get too
invigorated myself

CATHERINE
Why

BOBBY
What would I do with it Run amok

She comes up the stairs

BOBBY (CONTD)
Besides piano and swimming what
else do you do

CATHERINE
Well theres fishing and boating
Theres concerts on the mainland
and but I feel silly telling
you This is really your home You
probably know better than I what
there is to do

BOBBY
Nothing

CATHERINE
Nothing Then it must be very
boring for you here

BOBBY
Thats right Have you anything to
suggest

CATHERINE

I dont know Let me give it some
thought

She moves toward the front door with Bobby
following

BOBBY
Whatre you doing right now

INT DUPEA HOME - DAY

Catherine comes inside and moves toward the
stairway with Bobby behind

CATHERINE
Right now Im going to run a hot
tub and soak myself

BOBBY
Then after that

She goes up a few steps and turns back to him

CATHERINE
After that I plan to read some
music and rest for awhile

BOBBY
Tomorrow then

CATHERINE
Tomorrows a full practice day
(continues up the stairs)
But the day after is kind of open

At the top of the stairs she stops and looks down
at him

CATHERINE (CONTD)
Carl has hydrotherapy on Tuesdays

BOBBY
(as if it were a year)
The day after tomorrow

CATHERINE
If youre free

BOBBY
Yeah Ill probably be free

She turns and disappears into the second-floor
hallway
INT DUPEA KITCHEN - NIGHT

Dinner has concluded and Tita moves around the
table distributing cups and saucers Carl is
remote and off his feed Spicer attends Nicholas
and Catherine looks across the table to Bobby as he
drinks from a bottle of beer

After a moment a loud belch comes from Nicholas
and Tita quickly requests

TITA
Dont laugh

She attempts to stifle her own amusement as do
Bobby and Catherine then changes the subject

TITA (CONTD)
Whats wrong Carl you hardly ate
anything

CARL
I took some aspirin and it really
upset my stomach

Catherine begins pouring the coffee

CATHERINE
One thing thats hard to understand
is how you could have this
incredible background in music and
then just walk away from it
without a second thought

BOBBY
I gave it a second thought

Tita seats herself at the table addressing Spicer

TITA
He looks tired to me Spicer I
think you should put him to bed

He nods and as he gets up and wheels Nicholas from
the room

CATHERINE
I mean how could you not play
anymore Thats so strange to me

BOBBY
I have played a few times Here and
there As a matter of fact I was
once a rehearsal pianist for a Las
Vegas musical revue

CATHERINE
You dont call that music though

BOBBY
Of course I do Its music You
know

He places his hands on the table and simulates the
playing of a rousing production-type show-stopper
simultaneously vocalizing as he does

Though Tita and Catherine are amused Carl winces
disapprovingly and breaks into Bobbys act

CARL
Robert do you mind

BOBBY
What

CARL
Nothing Will you excuse us for a
while

He takes hold of Catherines hand and stands up

CATHERINE
We really dont have to Carl if
youre not feeling good

CARL
(a bit martyred)
Well maybe if we put the
Thermaphore on me for a while
first

CATHERINE
Oh all right

And as they move to the door she glances
apologetically back at Bobby

Deflated and embarrassed he looks away from Titas
sympathetic gaze After a brief silence she
reaches to a platter on the table

TITA
Do you want some gingerbread
BOBBY
(elsewhere)
What

TITA
With applesauce

BOBBY
No thanks

INT DUPEA LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Bobby stands in the living room It is dark and the
only light comes from some burning logs in the
fireplace He listens briefly to the sounds of a
Beethoven sonata coming from the music room

then moves to a chaise near the fireplace and
lies down staring absently into the flames After
a moment he closes his eyes

ANOTHER ANGLE

on his sleeping face as the sonata begins to FADE
INT DUPEA LIVING ROOM - MORNING

ON BOBBY

still asleep in the chaise He is suddenly jolted
awake by a loud thud and sits up looking out the
window to

POV OF SPICER

lifting a barbell with heavy weights attached to
it He does a series of vigorous presses with it
before he again lets the bar drop heavily onto the
porch

INT DUPEA HOME - UPSTAIRS HALL - DAY
(BACH VIOLIN OVER)

Bobby stands in the hallway a phone to his ear
listening to Rayette and looking down the hall
toward the open door to Catherines room

BOBBY
Yeah well fine you know what I
suggest Ray
(listening)
Because I dont know how long
Things are not going that well
here

He listens again his eyes on Catberine moving
around in her room

BOBBY (CONTD)

Yeah well Im not having any fun
either so why dont you

(pause)
No you cant its just not
convenient and I have to get
off

(listening impatiently)
Ray I really have to go I have to
get off now

(longer pause)
Another couple of days maybe Ill
call you and let you --

(pause)
All right if youre gone youre
gone Now I have to get off okay

(pause)
Bye Ray

He hangs up and as he starts down the hall to
Catherines room the VIOLIN STOPS and Carl steps
out into the hall ahead of him He carries his
fiddle and detains Bobby with

CARL
Only 10 minutes of playing and its
already killing my neck

Bobby looks past him to Catherine as she glances
out at them and then closes the door to her room

EXT DUPEA GROUNDS - DAY

Bobby and Carl playing a game of table tennis
Tita stands leaning against a tree watching them
In the bg Spicer can be seen meticulously
oiling and cleaning the wheelchair

As they volley the ball back and forth
BOBBY

You sure you should be playing
Carl
CARL
What do you mean Aside from my
neck Im in superb shape

Carl hits into the net and as the ball rebounds to
him he tosses it to Bobby

BOBBY
(serving)
I dont know theres something
wrong with the way you move

Carl hits the net again

CARL
Im not aware of it Like what

BOBBY
Your serve Two -- Eighteen

Carl serves and as they volley

BOBBY (CONTD)
Id hate to see you walk across a
concert stage like that

Carl tries a smash and mis-hits the ball

BOBBY (CONTD)
Two -- Nineteen

and as he retrieves it

CARL
(irritated with Bobby)
Ive walked across a stage a number
of times without exciting any
particular response

BOBBY
Thats what I mean

Carl comes back to the table

CARL
Any particular humor I meant

He angrily serves the ball
BOBBY

(returning)
I think you should get someone to
coach you how to walk I think its
a substantial problem

He hits a smash and it sails past Carl into some
shrubbery several yards away

CARL
Dammit

As he moves after the ball Bobby gestures at him

BOBBY
Look at that

TITA
Why are you being so mean

BOBBY
Im not He does walk funny Dont
you see that

She looks at Carl bent over and searching through
the shrubs

TITA
I dont think Id notice Im so
used to Carl

BOBBY
(wanting to go on about
it)
Yeah well hes

She interrupts him looking toward Spicer
TITA

Bobby Do you think Spicer is
attractive

He looks over at Spicer polishing the frame of the
wheelchair

BOBBY
I think hes got a terrific
personality

TITA

You know he was formerly a sailor

Bobby gestures his paddle at Carl on his way back
with the ball
BOBBY
Look cant you see that what Im
talking about

TITA
Sailors are sadistic I feel

Carl comes up to the table asserting

CARL
See Theres nothing wrong with the
way I walk Now where are we

BOBBY
At game Carl

Carl serves and they volley briefly Then BobbY
angles the ball sharply and puts it away

BOBBY (CONTD)
Thats three games to none Carl

CARL
All right lets have a rematch

BOBBY
I thought you had to go to the
mainland today Arent you going to
miss the ferry

Carl takes a quick glance at his watch then drops
his paddle onto the table

CARL
Too bad Just when I was hitting my
stride

He starts away then turns back
CARL (CONTD)
Say goodbye to Catherine for me

will you

As he moves off in the direction of the cars Tita
comes up beside Bobby

TITA
Can I play now

Carl calls over to them from his car

CARL
Tell her Ill be back sometime
tomorrow

Bobby turns to Tita

BOBBY
Where is she anyway

TITA
(ignoring the question)
My turn
He hands her the paddle

BOBBY
Why dont you and Spicer play

and moves off toward the house
INT DUPEA HOME - UPSTAIRS HALL - DAY

Bobby knocks on Catherines door and hearing no
response opens it and steps inside

INT CATHERINES ROOM - DAY

He wanders about discreetly touching nothing but
taking in some essence of Catherine from her
belongings and from the scent of her that lingers

in the room

His journey brings him into proximity with the
windows and he pauses to look out at

TITA AND SPICER BELOW

playing table tennis

He starts to move from the windows when he sees
CATHERINES CAR

pulling into view and parking near the garage She
gets out and carrying a shopping bag and a
wrapped bouquet of flowers pauses on her way to
the house to have some exchange with Tita

INT DUPEA HOME - STAIRCASE - DAY

ON BOBBY

quickly descending the staircase and FOLLOWING
with him as he moves to the music room and goes
inside leaving the door open

INT MUSIC ROOM - DAY

He crosses to one of the grands seats himself and
rubs his hands together to warm them Then
scanning his mental repertoire he places his hands
on the keyboard and begins to play a Chopin etude

Presently Catherine appears in the doorway She
stands listening for a moment then places the
shopping bag and flowers on a settee near the

doorway and crosses to a chair near the pianos and
sits down

Bobby glances at her then returns his eyes to the
keyboard

ON CATHERINE

her features intensely concentrated as she listens
to his playing

ON BOBBY
apparently deep into the music On the wall behind
him are the series of photographs seen in the
opening and the present ANGLE FAVORS an 8-year-old
Bobby in his dress suit playing a recital
THE CAMERA MOVES down to his hands

then to Catherine profoundly moved
ANGLE INCLUDING BOTH
as Bobby plays the concluding chords of the etude
He lets his hands linger on the keys until the last

overtones fade then he removes them to his lap

After a brief silence

CATHERINE
That was beautiful Robert Im
surprised

BOBBY
Thank you

CATHERINE

I was really very moved by the way
you

Unable to keep up the serious musician pose a
brief derisive laugh issues from him

CATHERINE (CONTD)
Is that funny

BOBBY
It wasnt supposed to be it just
struck me that way

CATHERINE
Why
BOBBY
Nothing Its just that I picked

the easiest piece I could remember
I think I first played it when I
was 8 years old and I played it
better then

CATHERINE
It doesnt matter It was the
feeling I was affected by

BOBBY
I didnt have any

CATHERINE
You had no inner feeling

BOBBY
None

CATHERINE
Then I must have been supplying it

She gets up and crosses toward the settee

BOBBY
Wait

CATHERINE
Well at least youre accomplished
at something

BOBBY
What

CATHERINE
At being a fake
And as she picks up the flowers and the shopping
bag

BOBBY
Catherine

CATHERINE
No youre very good at it Im
really impressed

She goes out the door

Bobby looks down at the keyboard He closes the
cover and softly utters

BOBBY
Shit

INT CATHERINES BEDROOM - DAY

She stands in front of a dresser mirror pinning up
her hair preparatory to taking a bath Her
attention is drawn to

Bobby entering and as he crosses to her she
quickly turns back to the mirror

BOBBY
You think Im a fake

CATHERINE
I think its what you think

BOBBY
No it isnt what I think

CATHERINE
Look You made a very calculated
move and then made me feel
embarrassed for responding to you
That wasnt necessary

She moves away from him and he follows her

BOBBY
Yes it was Youve made it clear
that if I can cut a little piano I
might get a little response

CATHERINE
(stops and turns to him)
I dont think thats accurate

BOBBY
Up to now what Ive been getting
from you are meaningful looks over
the dinner table and a lot of vague
suggestions about the day after
tomorrow

CATHERINE
Im not conscious of having given
you any meaningful looks And as
for the day after tomorrow this is
the day after tomorrow and I am

unfortunately seeing you Now if
youll excuse me Id like to take
a bath

She moves back to the dresser and as she begins
searching through an array of bath oils on top of
it Bobby steps in beside her

BOBBY
Its convenient to fake looking for
something right now isnt it

CATHERINE
Im not faking anything Im
looking for some bath oil

BOBBY
Some bath oil

He lifts up one of the bottles

BOBBY (CONTD)

What about this one

(picking up another)
Or this one

(and another)
How about some jasmine

(and another)
What about some musk

CATHFRINE
What are you doing

BOBBY
(knocking the bottles
over)
What are you doing screwing around
with this crap
A little intimidated by his aggressivity

CATHERINE
I dont find your language that
charming

BOBBY

Its direct anyway which seems to
be difficult for you

CATHERINE
Id like you to leave now Is that
direct enough

He makes no move to go

CATHERINE (CONTD)
Youre not a serious person by
your own admission And that may be
interesting but it doesnt
interest me

Needing the safety of distance she moves over to
the windows next to the bed Again he follows
after her

BOBBY
Serious thats whats important to
you

CATHERINE
Yes thats whats important to
me

He takes her by the shoulders

BOBBY
Okay lets be serious

and forces her onto the bed

CATHERINE
No dont do that

BOBBY
Shut up

He hesitates for a moment full of things he wants
to say and cannot Catherine looks up at him
uttering a quiet challenge
CATHERINE
No inner feeling

BOBBY
Thats right

CATHERINE
I dont believe vou

He leans down to her begins kissing her Her arms
encircle him and laying back on the bed she pulls
his body onto hers fervently returning his kisses
And as he responds with an ardor absent of fakery
and full of a lifetime of derelict feelings a FADE
OVER BEGINS to

INT CATHERINES BEDROOM - DAY

Catherine and Bobby lie side by side He watches
her as she addresses the ceiling

CATHERINE
I married him when I was 17 He was
a cellist and I thought he was the
most brilliant man Id ever met
And Im sure he was because at
that age I hadnt met that many
But he was insidious you know He
had me convinced that I was a
mediocrity musically as a woman
as an intellect But in this
completely imperceptible pleasant
way so that you werent even sure
he was doing it Anyway I just
woke up one morning and I said you
now something Joseph youre full
of beans and I left him

BOBBY
Thats what you said

fq

CATHERINE
Something witty and devastating
like that

She moves onto her side looking over at him

CATHERINE (CONTD)
As a matter of fact hes the one
who introduced me to Carl
(a pause then)
How are you
BOBBY
Im fine

CATHERINE
Carl restored my confidence He
really did Hes much more
substantial than you give him
credit for

BOBBY
Is he

CATHERINE
Yes

She reaches over tentatively caressing his face
then

CATHERINE (CONTD)
Do you think you could discreetly
move across the hall now

BOBBY
Yeah I think I could

He kisses her gets up and crosses to the door and
as he opens it

CATHERINE
Robert

BOBBY

CATHERINE

I could spend some time with you
tomorrow morning before Carl comes
back I mean if youd like to

INT DUPEA LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
FAVORING SAMIA GLAVIA

a friend of Carls (Somewhere under the following
the ANGLE ALTERS to include TWO OTHER FRIENDS as
well as Carl Catherine Bobby and Rayette seated
around the living room variously captive to her
monologue)

SAMIA
But the point is man is born into
the world with a pre-existent
adversary both real and imaginary
so youd have to say that
aggression was one of his primary
psychic inheritances which

JOHN FINCHER a professorial type attempts to
interject

FINCHER
If I may beg to differ

SAMIA
Beg all you like John but the
fact remains that man takes
enormous delight in aggressive
acts as well as the portrayal of
aggressive acts and to be
triumphant over another no matter
how seems fundamental to his
having a sense of well being as
well as

FINCHER
No I dont quarrel with your
inference but you draw too long a
bow in your conclusions which seem
unnecessarily harsh and

SAMIA
Well I dont make poetry As an
analyst I

Rayette interrupts calling across the room to
Carl

RAYETTE
Is there a TV in the house

Carl starts to answer and is pre-empted by Samia

SAMIA
John believes in the basic goodness
of man and thats fine but gaze
into the pit like I have and that
view seems a little soporific And
not unlike television it hardly
represents the real world

RAYETTE
Theres some good things on it
though

SAMIA
Pardon me

RAYETTE

fq

The TV Theres some good things on
it sometimes

SAMIA
strongly doubt it but I wasnt
really discussing media

FINCHER
£ you really hold such bleak
views how can you in good
conscience carry on a practice

SAMIA
Oh theres always hope I think
for a few individuals if theyre
courageous enough to shed their
illusions and their

CATHERINE
(cutting her off)
And what about love

SAMIA
What about it Wouldnt you agree
that a great deal of mischief has
been done in the name of love

CATHERINE
No I wouldnt

SAMIA
Well youre a romantic Catherine
as are most musicians and whats
more about to be married

ON BOBBY
and his reaction as Samia goes on

SAMIA
which should exclude you from
any objective discussion But keep
in mind even the arts arent free
of aggressive content nor the
institution of marriage

CATHERINE
I think these cold objective
discussions are aggressive
Samia

She gets up and starts to move away

SAMIA
But Id like to say so that I
dont dampen the spirit of your
adventure

CATHERINE
(cutting her off)
You havent dampened my spirit
Samia Excuse me

SAMIA
Well I should hope not

She leaves the room with Bobbys eyes following
her and as Carl moves over to sit beside Rayette

violently jerking his forearm up against Bobbys
trachea punctuating each jerk with the repeated
command

He feels Bobbys body slacken He releases him and
Bobby drops to the floor as

BOBBY

CATHERINE

Profoundly wounded he looks away from her

Needing to distance herself from witnessing his

pain

His eyes move from her to look out over the bay
after a brief silence he softly utters

and

but youre not understanding me

my music but because of you

seeing none

Bobby removes his jacket and lays it on top of the
waste container He moves to the wash basin and
stands a moment gazing absently down at it his
mind searching for that inward oblivion in which
nothing much is demanded nothing much felt

Then leaning over and placing his hands on the rim
of the basin
he lifts his gaze to the mirror and after
minutely perusing the features of his face looks
into his own eyes as he had into his fathers
silently beseeching them for guidance

dissipating in the air
